Chapter 1 – Border Teritory ‘Eastroad’
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black flying vessel
was soaring rapidly through the Endless Territories. Using spacetime
transfer arrays might allow you to skip 99% of the journey, but there
were still some areas you had no choice but to slowly fly through.
The distance would be comparatively short, but you would still need
to fly for decades or even centuries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the black flying
vessel. Ji Ning, Pillsaint, Su Youji were sipping wine and relaxing
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Eastroad
died? He was such an incredible Daolord, and yet he died, just like
that.” Pillsaint shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is probable that
after another 108,000 chaos cycles, every single Daolord of our
generation in the Endless territories will be dead! If even two or
three can survive, I would be amazed,” Su Youji said. To live past
108,000 required you to become an Eternal Emperor, but generally
speaking only the weakest, most unremarkable Daolords of the Fourth
Step would have a shot at it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had very weak
Daos, and so the had the best chance at the Daomerge. However…
after becoming Eternal Emperors, they would become the punching bags
of the Endless Territories! Daolords of great power would furiously
chase after them, hoping to kill them in order to make a name for
themselves. Thus, all of the weaker Eternal Emperors would soon die.
Only the slightly stronger ones or the ones who had special
protective abilities would be able to remain alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“108,000 chaos cycles
is a very, very long period of time. Haha. Ordinary mortals are only
able to live a hundred years, while many plants and crops only
survive for one harvest.” Ning chuckled. “I’ve been training
for far less than even a single chaos cycle; in fact, I’m not even
close to 0.01% of a chaos cycle yet. If I can be a dazzling figure
for 108,000 chaos cycles, I’ll be satisfied. But of course, if I
can succeed in my Daomerge and gain eternity, that would be even
better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Master, if you
succeeded and became an Eternal Emperor, you would probably become a
Hegemon,” Pillsaint said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He would definitely
be a Hegemon.” Su Youji’s eyes were shining. “I’m excited
just imagining him as a Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, alright.
Don’t get too crazy now.” Ning shook his head. Most likely, more
than a few of the most talented cultivators all dreamed of becoming
Hegemons, but that really was nothing more than a dream. How many
would actually be able to succeed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
nodded slowly. “Time to deal with that Daolord of the Fourth Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-world. There was a grassy area here with a green-robed alien
woman seated within it. She had long, graceful green hair and a pair
of silken blue eyes which were filled with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master actually
died. How could this have happened?” Although Daolord Kongsan had
died quite a few days ago, the green-robed woman still felt stunned.
She had her own direct connection to Kongsan, and so as soon as he
died she immediately knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master had
incredible powers aimed at keeping himself alive. Normal Eternal
Emperors would be able to do nothing to him.” The green-robed woman
was rather restless and nervous. “Then what should I do? Will that
white-robed Daolord kill me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No… I can’t just
die like this…” The green-robed woman’s heart was filled with
fear. Previously, she had been happy to be captured rather than
killed, as that meant the enemy might negotiate with Daolord Kongsan
and ransom her. But now that Kongsan was dead… there was no one who
would come to save her. Her destiny was completely within Ning’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A white-robed
figure suddenly manifested off in the distance. The green-robed woman
couldn’t help but turn her head to look at him, only to see him
walk towards her. He said calmly, “From that look on your face, I
imagine you already know that Daolord Kongsan is dead. You now have
two options. One, I kill you. Two, you submit to me and follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman’s
heart unclenched. Her greatest fear was that Ning would kill her
without even bothering to speak with her. She hurriedly rose to her
feet, then respectfully knelt down in front of Ning. “Naia is
willing to submit and forever serve you, Master. All of Naia’s
magic treasures are yours to take.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your magic treasures
remain your own.” Ning wouldn’t go so far as to take the
possessions of this new retainer. He smiled. “From this day forth,
you shall be my third Daolord retainer. Also – my Daoist monicker
is Darknorth. It’d be rather embarrassing if you didn’t even know
the name of the person you were serving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Daolord Naia said respectfully. In her heart, she repeated the name
‘Darknorth’ over and over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth,
Daolord Naia became Ning’s retainer as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Naia swore a
lifeblood oath and was then summoned out of the estate-world by Ning
to the black flying vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you
should get acquainted with each other.” Ning smiled as he pointed
at the green-robed woman. “She is Daolord Naia, formerly the eldest
disciple of Kongsan. From this day forth, she shall be one of my
retainers as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Fourth Step?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A retainer?” Both
Pillsaint and Su Youji were rather excited, and they began to engage
Daolord Naia in a casual conversation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Naia was a
taciturn person, but she wasn’t a bad person by nature. Ning had
purchased the most detailed intelligence report the Skywood Sect had
regarding Daolord Kongsan, and so he had naturally learned some
information regarding his disciples as well. Kongsan’s eldest
disciple, Daolord Naia, had been introduced in detail. She had
loyally followed and served Kongsan, not causing any trouble or going
out of her way to commit sinful deeds. She was a very obedient and
loyal subordinate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
she is not a villain by nature. I suppose I can accept it.” This
was the reason why Ning had been willing to take her own as a
retainer. If she was a very vile person, Ning probably would’ve
slain her without a second glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning led Su
Youji, Pillsaint, and Naia on their journey. They first visited the
Brightshore Kingdom, making use of its spacetime tunnels to travel to
a very remote part of the Endless Territories which was closer to the
Eastroad Territory. This was an extremely long journey. Fortunately,
Ning had a vessel which flew at a hundred times the speed of light,
and had also saved a great deal of travel time by using the
Brightshore Kingdom’s spacetime tunnels. And so, after five hundred
or so years they finally reached the distant Eastroad Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastroad
Territory. This puts us at the outermost borderlands of the Endless
Territories.” The black flying vessel flew out of a chaos star and
into the primordial chaos. Ning and the others were aboard the
vessel, and they stared at the vast territory before them. This was
the Eastroad Territory!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Daolord
Naia said respectfully, “The Eastroad Territory, as one of the
outermost border territories, is a place of great danger. There are
also sinister forces hidden here! When Daolord Eastroad was alive,
his fame and reputation sufficed to stun and overawe the entire
territory, ensuring that those sinister forces wouldn’t dare to
cause any trouble. But now that he is dead… I’m afraid his
homeland will never be so stable again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the reason
why his greatest concern was for what would happen to his homeland
after he died,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The borderlands of
the Endless Territories…” Ning glanced off into the distance.
“Outside the borderlands is the Great Dark, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Great
Dark.” Daolord Naia nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An endless sea of
darkness… darkness without end…” Pillsaint let out a sigh as
well, and Su Youji had a complex look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless Territories
was the region where countless cultivators, Aberrants, Aeonians, and
others all lived. But what was outside of it? Aside from some
incredibly dangerous places like the Terror Starsea, outside the
Endless Territories lay the endless darkness of the Great Dark. There
were no chaos stars there, nor chaosworlds, nor light, nor spacetime
transfer arrays. There was nothing more than silent, deathly still
darkness. Darkness without end! How long did the darkness stretch? No
one knew, because it was simply too vast. Daolords would not dare to
traverse it… but Eternal Emperors, who had endless longevity,
would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow,
Emperor Waveshift, and other mighty figures were all filled with
curiosity about the Great Dark, and so they had entered it and began
a drifting journey through it. They had unlimited lifespans, which
was why they dared do such a thing… but despite that, they had
still yet to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than one
Daolord has given it a try,” Ning said softly. “Those Daolords
sent their avatars to explore the Great Dark, but to the day they
died their avatars were still mired in the endless darkness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying,”
Pillsaint murmured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that
terrifying. In the end, the Great Dark is just a dead region,”
Daolord Naia said. “By contrast, the Terror Starsea is truly
frightening. The Terror Starsea is similarly endless, but it is
filled with countless dangers and unlimited possibilities. Not even
the three Hegemons dare to barge into it rashly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Terror Starsea
is the number one deathtrap that we know of.” Ning smiled. “But
enough of that. When we’re all tired of living, we can go pay the
Terror Starsea a little visit. For now, let’s stay away from places
we aren’t supposed to visit. Come. Our mission this time is to help
Daolord Eastroad pacify his homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pacifying this
territory would not be an easy feat. This was a borderlands
territory, which meant that the Dao Alliance’s influence here was
virtually negligible! Some of the surrounding territories being
controlled by the Aberrants, the Aeonians, and even some other
sinister forces. Some even suspected that outside invaders, such as
the Dark Kingdom, were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, the
borderlands were amongst the most chaotic places in all the Endless
Territories.

Chapter 2 – Danger Lurking Everywhere
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastroad Territory.
The Eastroad Everworld. A black flying vessel was soaring through the
air above the Eastroad Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The territories
controlled by the Dao Alliance will generally have spacetime transfer
arrays within the everworlds.” Pillsaint stood at the prow of the
ship, staring at the vast everworld before him. He sighed, “But the
Eastroad Everworld doesn’t have a single one. We had to fly for
years to get to this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning chuckled. It
was true that all ordinary everworlds had spacetime transfer arrays.
The Badlands Everworld, the Vastheaven Everworld… they all had one.
But the Eastroad Everworld did not! It had taken them three years of
hard flying after entering the Eastroad Territory before they reached
this everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to
Eastroad City first,” Ning said. Swoosh! The flying vessel tore
through space, blinking through it as it advanced rapidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the most bustling city within the entire Eastroad Everworld,
‘Eastroad City’, appeared within their field of vision. This was
an extremely large city with many cultivators in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Restrain your auras,
the three of you,” Ning instructed. “Especially you, Naia. You
are a Daolord of the Fourth Step; your aura is going to scare these
ordinary cultivators silly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,”
Daolord Naia said respectfully. As a Daolord of the Fourth Step, her
aura was as vast and boundless as the heavens themselves. With each
step Daolords took, they trod the line between life and death. With
each breakthrough, their auras would undergo fundamental
transformations! Daolords of the First Step and Second Step were
fairly weak, and so even if their auras emanated outwards they would
at most caused World-level cultivators to feel a sense of pressure.
But a Daolord of the Fourth Step would cause them to absolutely
quiver in fear!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flying
vessel soared downwards. A short while later Ning put it away,
leading Naia, Pillsaint, and Su Youji towards the gates of the city.
There were twelve World-level cultivators at the gates who were
standing in two groups to each side, watching the cultivators enter
Eastroad City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They seem very
cautious.” Ning was a bit surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It might be because
this is a borderlands territory, which is why their cities are so
strictly guarded,” Su Youji sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
chatted casually as they entered the city gates. When the twelve
World-level cultivators noticed Ning’s group of four, their
leader’s face tightened. The leader gestured to a subordinate and
said, “Report immediately that four suspicious Daolords have
appeared in Eastroad City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” This
subordinate had a clone and so was able to immediately report this to
the main sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to frown as
he walked through Eastroad City. “Something is wrong.” Ning could
sense that the mood in this city was off. Many of the cultivators
were clearly speaking privately to each other through mental
messages. Although Ning couldn’t tell what they were saying, he was
able to tell that they were doing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the area
with his gaze, only to see several distant Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals who seemed to be sending stealthy mental messages to each
other. Ning immediately sent out his godsense, covering them with it.
Although he was now a Daolord with powerful godsense, if he tried to
use it to scan World-level cultivators they would probably notice
something was off. Once they did, they would definitely stop talking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastroad Sect is
finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The mighty
Eastroad Sect is about to be annihilated, just like that. What a
shame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard from Master
that the founding Patriarch of the Eastroad Sect, ‘Daolord
Eastroad’, is already dead. He was someone who stunned and awed the
surrounding territories and ruled over the Eastroad Territory for
countless years… but he died, just like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Logically speaking,
the Eastroad Sect should’ve hidden the news that Daolord Eastrod
had died. How could word have spread so quickly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who knows? There has
to be some sort of plot behind it. However, the news of him being
dead is probably true. Otherwise, the Eastroad Sect wouldn’t act in
such a craven fashion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what the Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals were quietly whispering to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning heard this,
his face tightened. What? The information had already leaked out?
Factoring in the time they had taken to travel to this place, Daolord
Eastroad had died roughly two thousand years ago. To cultivators, two
thousand years was an extremely short period of time. Logically
speaking, there was no way the Eastroad Sect would’ve so foolishly
spread word of this. They would’ve done their best to hide it for
as long as they could… but now, even Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals knew of it. It seemed as though word had spread long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you.”
Ning suddenly intercepted two nearby World-level cultivators. With
but a thought, he completely sealed off the surrounding area while
covering them with a flicker of his murderous sword-intent. However,
none of the nearby cultivators were able to even see this happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“S-senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two World-level
cultivators were so frightened, their legs went soft. One could
imagine how terrifying Ning’s sword-intent was. Their hearts
quivered just having that sword-light flicker around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji,
Pillsaint, and Naia were all rather puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know
shortly,” Ning said, then cast his gaze towards the two World-level
cultivators before him. “Tell me, what has happened recently in the
Eastroad Territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, did you just
arrive here?” The shorter cultivator said hurriedly, “Something
major truly has happened. Roughly one or two thousand years ago, it
was suddenly reported that Daolord Eastroad, who ruled over the
Eastroad Territory for countless years, has already perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who made the
report?” Ning asked. One or two thousand years ago? So roughly
eight hundred years after his death, the word had been leaked
already?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know the
answer to that,” the short cultivator said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
Ning frowned, sending a strand of his baleful intent towards the two.
The nearby tall and skinny cultivator hurriedly said, “Maybe the
Ninedust Sect!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” The
shorter cultivator hurriedly agreed, “It is very likely that this
information was leaked by the Ninedust Sect. The Ninedust Sect has
been applying a great deal of pressure in recent years. It seems as
though they intend to take over the Eastroad Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Eastroad had
established the Eastroad Sect and then unified this territory, but
the surrounding area was still quite chaotic. There were a number of
powerful organizations here, with the most dominating one being the
Ninedust Sect. The Ninedust Sect already had nine Daolords when it
was first established! By now, its sectlord and three of its vice
sectlords were all Daolords of the Fourth Step. However, Daolord
Eastroad himself was so overwhelming powerful that the Ninedust Sect
was unwilling to offend him, even though they didn’t fear him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect
has been causing a great deal of trouble during the past thousand
years, and the Eastroad Sect actually lost one of its Daolords during
this period of time. It now only has a single Daolord left,” the
short cultivator said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another Daolord of
the Eastroad Sect died?” Ning’s face tightened. “Which one?”
The Eastroad Sect originally had three Daolords; Daolord Eastroad,
Daolord Overgold, and Daolord Thunderheat. Daolord Overgold and
Daolord Thunderheat were Daolords of the Third Step, with Overgold
being a bit stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was Daolord
Overgold who died,” the shorter cultivator said. “I heard that he
died while adventuring, but for him to die just a few centuries after
word spread of Daolord Eastroad’s death… how could there be such
a coincidence? It is very likely that the Ninedust Sect sent out
major powers to kill him outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that means the
Eastroad Sect only has one Daolord left?” Pillsaint was rather
flabbergasted, while Ning, Su Youji, and Naia were all rather
surprised as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This had originally
been a fairly simple mission, because Daolord Overgold was quite
strong; with the formation around their headquarters helping them and
some treasures Ning’s group was bringing, he should’ve been able
to keep himself alive. Now it seemed the situation was much worse
than they had imagined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
leave now,” Ning said. He didn’t really care if these two
World-level cultivators told others of this conversation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A-a-alright,” they
stuttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Su Youji,
Pillsaint, and Naia were all rather irritated and frustrated now.
“This is going to be a bit more tricky than we expected.” Ning
frowned. “Word of Daolord Eastroad’s death spread less than eight
centuries after he died. There’s no way the Eastroad Sect itself
would’ve been so foolish as to leak this information. An enemy must
have done it, after they acquired this information through Numerancy
divination or other intelligence-gathering methods. A short while
later, Overgold died while adventuring as well. It might’ve been an
actual coincidence, but it’s also possible that he was murdered. If
he was murdered… then the real goal was to further weaken the
Eastroad Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Pillsaint,
Su Youji, and Naia all felt irritated as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s gather some
more information first.” Ning continued to advance through Eastroad
City, and the more he investigated the more he learned. The Ninedust
Sect really was about to take over the Eastroad Territory, and the
Eastroad Sect really did only have Daolord Thunderheat protecting it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, go into my
estate-world. Otherwise… if multiple Daolords pay a visit, with one
being a Daolord of the Fourth Step, the Eastroad Sect will probably
be frightened. They are no doubt quite nervous right now,” Ning
said to Su Youji and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Su
Youji and the other two acknowledged the order. After they entered
the estate-world, Ning flew by himself through the air towards the
Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, the skies around him turned dark as multiple layers of
formations around the Eastroad Sect were activated in a dazzling,
awesome display of multicolored light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning soon flew to the
main gates of the Eastroad Sect, where he was forced to come to a
halt.

Chapter 3 – Within the Eastroad Sect
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please stop,
Daolord!” The Eastroad Sect’s gate-guarding disciple hurriedly
called out to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning smiled as he
came to a halt, then said, “Hurry up and send word that I come
bearing the last will of Daolord Eastroad. I would like to ask
Daolord Thunderheat to come meet with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You come bearing the
will of the old Patriarch?” The gate-guarding disciple was shocked.
Could it be that the old Patriarch really had prepared something for
them? But why hadn’t he said anything to them before he died?
Perhaps it was because he had died so suddenly that his avatar didn’t
even have a chance to tell them about it. He immediately said, “Wait
here for a brief moment, Daolord. I’ll send word right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eastroad
Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat had
a violet complexion and curly whiskers, making him look like quite a
barbarous figure. In reality, he was a very steady and experienced
figure who had been running most affairs in the Eastroad Sect for
countless years now, while Daolord Eastroad and Daolord Overgold were
out adventuring. Who would’ve imagined that both of them would end
up perishing, one after the other?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Whenever
Daolord Thunderheat thought of this, he couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, the Eastroad
Sect was built up over the course of countless years. We can’t just
abandon our foundation like this.” Two yellow-robed disciples were
next to Daolord Thunderheat, and the white-haired one was the one who
just spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who wishes to
destroy the Eastroad Sect will pay a heavy price for it.” The other
disciple, a pudgy man who was similarly filled with a baleful look in
his eyes, agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat
shook his head. “The Patriarch was an incredibly, freakishly
powerful Daolord. Over the course of countless years, he established
an incredibly deep and solid foundation for our Eastroad Sect, but…
if we want to protect it, in the end we’ll have to rely on our own
power. The Ninedust Sect is just worried about some desperation
attacks that we might unleash, which is why they’ve only been
threatening us while not actually attacking us. But as more time
passes… in the end, sooner or later we will be annihilated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” The two
disciples felt both rage and grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you are
merely at the World level. You don’t understand how terrifying the
Ninedust Sect is.” Daolord Thunderheat sighed. “Especially
Daolord Ninedust himself. He was close to being on par with even the
old Patriarch himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two disciples
ground their teeth, unwilling to accept this. The exalted Eastroad
Sect had been dazzling and glorious for so many years. Everyone in
the surrounding territories had always feared and respected them,
with even the mighty Ninedust Sect going out of its way to avoid
causing them trouble. But now, with their great sheltering tree gone,
the Eastroad Sect was about to tumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-Master!”
Suddenly, a disciple came running towards them. He came to a halt
outside the door, then said with breathless excitement,
“Uncle-Master, an unfamiliar Daolord has arrived. He said he came
bearing the will of the old Patriarch and wishes to meet with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Thunderheat suddenly rose to his feet while looks of excitement
appeared on the faces of his two yellow-robed disciples. “He came
bearing the will of the old Patriarch?” Daolord Thunderheat felt
excitement as well. The existence of their sect, and in fact their
entire clan, had been due to Daolord Eastroad! The reason why
Thunderheat and Overgold had been able to become Samsara Daolords was
partially because of Daolord Eastroad’s guidance. As a result,
Daolord Eastroad’s status in the sect was extremely, extremely
high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired
disciple next to him said with delight, “Master, the old Patriarch
must have made arrangements before he died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. Let me go out and take a look first.” Daolord
Thunderheat felt eager as well. His body flickered as he immediately
flew out of the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the main gates
of the Eastroad Sect. Daolord Thunderheat immediately saw the
white-robed youth bearing that black scabbard on his back who was
standing outside the main gates. The white-robed youth’s aura was
indeed that of a Daolord’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord
Thunderheat frowned. The white-robed youth’s aura seemed to be even
weaker than Thunderheat’s own aura. He was probably a Daolord of
the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord.” Daolord
Thunderheat stepped forwards and spoke out to Ning. As for Ning, he
saw a figure suddenly appear within the barrier formations
surrounding the sect. It was an extremely muscular man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you Daolord
Thunderheat?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am. Dare I ask who
you are, fellow Daoist?” Daolord Thunderheat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.”
Ning smiled. “Can we chat inside? Shall you invite me in?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, r-right. Please
come in.” Daolord Thunderheat’s mind was in a state of chaos
right now, which was why he had forgotten even the basic courtesies
of welcoming guests. He hurriedly led Ning into the Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a courtyard
inside the Eastroad Sect. A female attendant delivered a flagon of
Immortal wine. Daolord Thunderheat sat to one side, with two
yellow-robed attendants standing next to him. Ning sat to the other
side. Ning was quite relaxed as he drank the wine. He let out a
praiseful sigh, then said “What a wonderful flavor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.” Daolord Thunderheat couldn’t help but ask, “Didn’t
you say you came bearing our old Patriarch’s will?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“With regards to this matter, I have to mention my senior
apprentice-brother Daolord Soleman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Soleman?”
Daolord Thunderheat was startled upon hearing this. He had naturally
heard the Patriarch speak of Soleman. Soleman and the Patriarch had
definitely been good friends, and Soleman had perhaps been only on
par with the Patriarch in power, but as a Heartforce Cultivator he
had far more bizarre and inscrutable techniques. In the Endless
Territories, Soleman definitely had a higher status than Eastroad
had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Daolord
Eastroad was on an adventure with my senior apprentice-brother
Daolord Soleman, as well as Daolord Skyaxe. They ended up in a dire
situation. Skyaxe and Soleman managed to survive, but Daolord
Eastroad was just a bit unlucky and ended up losing his life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Daolord
Thunderheat revealed a look of of pain and sorrow, and the two
yellow-robed disciples by his side quivered, their hearts filled with
pain, sorrow, and regret. Why was it that the other two had survived
while their Patriarch had died?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All three of them
knew that it was possible they would perish, and so they all left
behind wills for the survivors to carry out,” Ning explained.
“Before Daolord Eastroad died, his greatest and only concern was
for his homeland. After the other two survived and escaped, they
asked me to help deliver some treasures to the Eastroad Sect. Take a
look and see if they will be of assistance to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tossed out a
storage bracelet, one which Daolord Soleman had used to store various
magic treasures. Swoosh. The bracelet flew before Daolord
Thunderheat, who accepted it rather excitedly. He quickly bound it,
then began to scan the items within as the two yellow-robed disciples
behind him waited impatiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, Daolord Thunderheat put away the bracelet with a rather mixed
expression on his face. This bracelet had also contained a talisman
from Daolord Eastroad, one which all three Daolords had left behind
with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors Soleman and
Skyaxe left behind quite a few treasures.” Daolord Thunderheat
sighed. “They even included two Dao-seals of incredible power; both
of them created one, and I can tell they poured many resources and
energy into each. There are also a number of formations and other
things. In a normal situation, they would be enough for us to protect
the Eastroad Sect… but our enemy is now the Ninedust Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, is it still
not enough?” The two yellow-robed disciples behind him grew
nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust
Sectlord is close to Soleman and Skyaxe in power. Even if they came
in person, they would at most be able to defeat the sectlord but
probably be unable to kill him.” Daolord Thunderheat continued,
“Just two Dao-seals… they might be enough to kill ordinary
Daolords of the Fourth Step, but they absolutely wouldn’t be of any
use against the Ninedust Sectlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. the
Ninedust Sectlord was most likely on Kongsan’s level of power. He
was slightly weaker than Skyaxe and Soleman, but would be able to
stay alive if attacked by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Thunderheat, is the Ninedust Sect truly preparing to move against the
Eastroad Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord
Thunderheat let out a hate-filled growl. “Brother Overgold was
killed by the Ninedust Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning’s
face tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Overgold’s
avatar personally told me this just before he died.” Daolord
Thunderheat said with hatred, “Unfortunately, when he was attacked
he was very, very far away from the Eastroad Sect. There was no way
for us to save him. But of course… I wouldn’t have been able to
do so regardless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a solemn look
on his face. So it was indeed the Ninedust Sect which had killed
Daolord Overgold? Everything was now quite clear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My clansmen have
been evacuated quite some time ago, to ensure that our line won’t
be completely extinguished.” Daolord Thunderheat said softly, “As
for us… no matter what, we’ve sworn to defend this place to the
death. This is our home, the place where we have lived for countless
years. We’ll rely on the formations protecting the formation as
well as the treasures the old Patriarch left behind. In the end,
we’ll ensure that the Ninedust Sect will lose a few teeth as they
devour our clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re going to
fight to the death,” the two yellow-robed disciples said furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators sought
their own Daos, their own paths. Once they chose to fight to the
death, they would be truly fearless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentleman.” Ning
spoke out. “I’ve already promised senior apprentice-brother
Soleman and the others that I will ensure the safety and security of
your homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat and
the others stared at Ning, startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since I’ve
promised it, I’ll carry my promise out.” Ning said calmly,
“There’s no need for you to worry about the Ninedust Sect. I’ll
handle everything!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll handle
everything?” Daolord Thunderheat and the others stared at this
Daolord of the Second Step in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
Whoosh. Three figures suddenly appeared by his side, each with the
aura of a Daolord. They were Pillsaint, Su Youji, and Daolord Naia.
Daolord Naia’s aura was particularly overwhelming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Daolord
Naia, Su Youji, and Pillsaint said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat and
his two disciples stared at them in astonishment. A Daolord of the
Fourth Step was respectfully calling a Daolord of the Second Step
‘master’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at Daolord
Thunderheat. “Fellow Daoist Thunderheat, I didn’t realize how
grim the situation was. However, since I’ve promised senior
apprentice-brother Soleman to handle this, I will! If the Ninedust
Sect dares to attack, I’ll kill as many as they come!”

Chapter 4 – The Void Pathway
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat and
his two yellow-robed disciples were all rather stunned. These words
were a bit too dominating. Kill as many as they come?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F-Fellow Daoist
Darknorth…” Daolord Thunderheat felt both eagerness and
nervousness. “Are you saying that this lady Daolord will be able to
resist the Ninedust Sect?” As he spoke, he glanced at Daolord Naia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her name is Naia,”
Ning said. When Daolord Thunderheat heard her name, he felt a cold
feeling crawl past his heart. This was a name he had never heard
before! Although he rarely went out adventuring, he knew almost all
of the truly famous figures. This meant Daolord Naia wasn’t all
that famous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Daolord
Naia. May I ask, if you are supported by the formations which protect
my Eastroad Sect, will you be able to defeat the Ninedust Sectlord?”
Daolord Thunderneat asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even with the
formations helping me, I would probably be defeated and slain by him
in a single strike,” Daolord Naia said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Daolord
Thunderheat was flabbergasted. Daolord Naia was telling the truth;
the Ninedust Sectlord was on the same level as Daolord Kongsan. Naia
couldn’t even withstand a single strike from Ning, who in turn
didn’t dare to fight Daolord Kongsan in close combat. There was an
enormous and obvious difference in power between ordinary Daolords of
the Fourth Step and the truly freakishly powerful ones. The Ninedust
Sectlord was one of the latter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth,
didn’t you just say that you would kill as many as come?” The
white-haired disciple couldn’t help but ask this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did say just
that.” Ning nodded. “But I meant, I would kill them personally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personally?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat and
the others all stared at Ning. “It isn’t that I look down upon
you, fellow Daoist… but if my judgement is correct, you should be a
Daolord of the Second Step,” Daolord Thunderheat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. A Daolord of
the Second Step.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Second Step, fight against the Ninedust Sectlord?” Daolord
Thunderheat couldn’t help but shake his head. Daolords trod a line
between life and death with each step, and the difference in power
between each step was very apparent. Someone at the second step,
challenge someone who was at the fourth step? The Ninedust Sectlord
himself was a freakishly powerful Daolord, even amongst his peers at
the fourth step. Ning, defeat him? The prospects were remote.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Daolord Naia said
coldly, “My master defeated me in a single blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat and
his two disciples were badly shocked by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the outside
world, I probably wouldn’t be a match for the Ninedust Sectlord.
But if I was in the Eastroad Sect’s base? I trust that Daolord
Eastroad personally established the formations protecting this place,
and that they possess extraordinary power. With it reinforcing me, I
won’t fear him at all.” Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes! The old
Patriarch personally established all of the formations around the
Eastroad Sect, and they truly are incredible.” Daolord Thunderheat
felt both excited and ashamed. “Please pardon me, fellow Daoist. I
previously didn’t dare imagine that you would be as powerful as
this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
even the most freakishly talented of Daolords of the Second Step
wouldn’t be at this level of power. I only am due to certain
special secret arts,” Ning said casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Secret arts are part
of your power as well.” Daolord Thunderheat was extremely excited.
Hope! He finally saw hope. He certainly didn’t believe that Ning
was nothing more than issuing empty boasts. No one who was capable of
making a Daolord of the Fourth Step would be so foolish, because the
consequences would arrive alongside the Ninedust Sectlord… and the
consequences would be fatal. Thus, it seemed likely that this
‘Darknorth’ fellow really was capable of handling things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Daolord Thunderheat prepared a sumptuous banquet for Ning and the
others. After the banquet concluded, Daolord Thunderheat personally
escorted Ning away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist,”
Daolord Thunderheat said softly, “If you were to break through to
the third step, would your chances of defeating the Ninedust Sectlord
improve?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Third Step?” Ning chuckled as he glanced at Daolord Thunderheat.
“If I can reach the third step, my chances will greatly improve. In
that situation, even without the assistance of the Eastroad Sect’s
formations I still wouldn’t need to fear him. In fact, I might even
be able to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t just
bragging. If he truly did break through from the first step and
become a Daolord of the Second Step… given the power of his Omega
Sword Dao, he really would become on par with the likes of Daolord
Kongsan and the Ninedust Sectlord. In addition, his Omega Sword Dao
was flawlessly perfect in every aspect, making it absolutely perfect
for actual combat. So long as the opponent did not flee and chose to
continue the fight, the end result would definitely be the opponent
getting the worst of it! But of course, no one would be so foolish as
to stand there and get beaten down like that. Clever Daolords like
Kongsan would retreat as soon as the situation turned south for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he
hadn’t been able to flee was because the Hegemon’s Dao-seal was
simply too powerful, causing even spacetime to be bound and
suppressed. Daolord Kongsan had used two life-saving treasures in a
row without being able to escape. It wasn’t that his fleeing
abilities were weak, it was simply that the Dao-seal was far too
powerful. It would have been easy for him to flee from most Daolords
he battled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then how long would
it take you to break through to become a Daolord of the Third Step,
fellow Daoist?” Thunderheat asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not too far
off,” Ning said. To go from the first step to the second step was
quite quick, and to go from the second step to the third step didn’t
take that long either. Reaching the fourth step, however, was a very
long process. As for succeeding in the Daomerge and gaining Eternity?
Chances were slim, no matter how much time you took.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Daolord
Thunderheat clenched his teeth. “Fellow Daoist Darknorth, the
Eastroad Sect has a sect-guarding treasure which the old Patriarch
brought back from the Terror Starsea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
Something from the Terror Starsea?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Technically
speaking, I shouldn’t divulge its existence to outsiders. However,
I am now the sole master of the Eastroad Sect, which is now facing an
existential crisis. I’m going to ignore those rules.” Daolord
Thunderheat looked at Ning. “This supreme treasure is known as the
Void Pathway, and it is extremely beneficial to cultivators. Perhaps,
fellow Daoist, you will be able to seize this opportunity to break
through to become a Daolord of the Third Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat was
simply too worried. He hoped that Darknorth would be able to grow
even more powerful, as this matter would have an impact on the life
and death of the Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void Pathway?”
Ning couldn’t help but begin to feel curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,”
Daolord Thunderheat said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat led
the way, while Ning followed from behind. Thunderheat dispelled one
formation after another as he guided Ning to a seemingly ordinary
courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you see that?”
Daolord Thunderheat pointed at a decorative sculpture of a mountain
located in the corner of the courtyard. The ‘mountain’ even had
some vines and ‘trees’ growing from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about it?”
Ning was puzzled. There was nothing unusual about that artificial
mountain. In fact, he couldn’t sense any formations from it at all.
Daolord Thunderheat stepped forward, then waved his hand. The vines
instantly were reduced to dust, revealing what was hidden beneath
them. This ‘mountain’ actually had a sculpted stone ‘door’ on
it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that a doorway?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. A door. A door
that you can open,” Daolord Thunderheat said. “Daolord Darknorth,
please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheaet
walked towards one of the sculpted stone doors, then pressed his hand
upon it. Instantly, the doorway split open with a rumbling sound,
revealing a deep, dark tunnel beneath it. The entrance to this tunnel
ebbed and flowed with spatial ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
Prior to the stone door opening, this had seemed like nothing more
than a very ordinary sculpture of a mountain. He hadn’t sensed any
thing special or magical about it at all… but it now had a
dimensional hallway within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Daolord
Thunderheat turned to look at Ning, then stepped inside. Ning
followed him without hesitation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Space twisted
and flowed around Ning as a dazzling, glowing golden region appeared
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning and Daolord Thunderheat were standing within a long walkway. The
floor was black, and the walkway itself was hanging in empty space,
with nothing but the void on each side of the walkway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Void
Pathway. Everything around this golden region is just empty space;
the only thing here is this Void Pathway hanging in space.” Daolord
Thunderheat pointed towards the front. This walkway was an extremely
long one, stretching off at least ten million kilometers. In front of
the walkway stood a number of armored soldiers and guards. Ning’s
visual prowess allowed him to clearly see to the very end of the
walkway, where there was a royal golden throne.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are a total of
thirty thousand soldiers here,” Daolord Thunderheat said. “Once
you begin advancing through the Void Pathway, you will be impeded by
these soldiers. The deeper you go, the more terrifyingly powerful the
soldiers will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning revealed
a smile. This seemed quite similar to the Brightshore Kingdom’s
‘Daolord Cloudworld’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These soldiers have
very unique combat Daos. Very, very unique.” Daolord Thunderheat
looked at Ning. “You’ll see for yourself when you fight them. The
weakest of them are comparable to Daolords of the Second Step, which
is why only the Daolords of the Eastroad Sect are permitted to enter
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did Daolord Eastroad
manage to reach the throne?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The old Patriarch
tried twice. He failed the first time. He later gained certain
insights, then went all out in a second attempt and managed to
succeed. The two final soldiers are all comparable to him in power,”
Daolord Thunderheat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. This
was much more impressive than the Daolord Cloudworld. Anyone who had
reached the threshold of power for a Daolord of the Fourth Step would
be able to battle their way to the very end of the Daolord
Cloudworld, but it seemed as though this place required the trial
taker to be comparable to Daolord Eastroad in power. Daolord Eastroad
was already comparable to the weaker Eternal Emperors. How was it
that these guards were as powerful as this?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately,
there’s no way to bring out even one of these thirty thousand
soldiers. In fact, there’s no way to control them at all.”
Daolord Thunderheat sighed. “If there was, why would we worry about
the Ninedust Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, his gaze
focused on the golden throne at the end of the walkway. “What
happens once you reach the throne? Anything good?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A legacy,” Daolord
Thunderheat said. “The old Patriarch didn’t tell me in detail,
and so I imagine that the so-called legacy wouldn’t be all that
interesting to freakishly strong Daolords like yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. He had
the legacy of the Sword Hegemon and the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] of
the Paragon of Pills. There really weren’t many legacies that would
interest him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, when those
thirty thousand soldiers fight against you, you’ll benefit from the
insights into the Dao you will gain.” Daolord Thunderheat sighed.
“Even the old Patriarch benefited from his first attempt, resulting
in him becoming much more powerful.”

Chapter 5 – Ten Thousand Years of Cultivation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded, then
suddenly asked, “Fellow Daoist Thunderheat, might I ask if my
retainers can enter as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat let
out a pained laugh. “Fellow Daoist Darknorth, the Void Pathway is
the most important treasure of the entire Eastroad Sect. You have
vowed to save our entire sect, and the debt we owe you is endless!
Your retainers and your closest friends can all make the attempt as
well, but I ask that you not divulge anything about it at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was briefly
startled, then nodded. “I swear on my very life itself that aside
from my retainers, I will not speak of the Void Pathway to anyone
else.” His voice echoed within the void and within his very own
soul. This was a lifeblood oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That wasn’t
necessary. The Eastroad Sect trusts you fully, fellow Daoist
Darknorth,” Daolord Thunderheat said hurriedly. In reality,
however, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief. He did want
Ning to swear a lifeblood oath, but he was also begging Ning to
prevent his entire sect from being wiped out, which was why he had
never proactively mentioned any oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was only proper,”
Ning said casually. He could tell what the man was thinking. Still,
he really wasn’t all that concerned about this opportunity. The
cultivators of the Three Realms had their own opportunities to
exploit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those three
retainers of mine will never spread this information either. I’ll
have them swear oaths as well,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um…” Daolord
Thunderheat chuckled. “Then I won’t bother you any further.
Whenever you wish to leave, fellow Daoist, you only need to turn back
and you’ll be able to depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded, and Daolord Thunderheat departed. Ning chuckled and shook his
head. The fewer treasures one had, the more one would value them!
Ning had acquired all of Daolord Kongsan’s treasures, and had the
Sword Hegemon’s Dao-seal. Although this Void Pathway was a unique
treasure, it wasn’t enough to make Ning feel the slightest bit
greedy. Ning also knew that the more powerful he became, the more
treasures he would have in the future. In the future, this Void
Pathway would be even less meaningful than it was right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But let me take a
look and see what’s so special about this thing.” Ning stepped
forwards, moving tens of thousands of kilometers in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous globe of
golden light suddenly appeared high in the void above the golden
region. The globe of light unleashed two streaks of golden light
which shot into the bodies of the two armored warriors directly in
front of Ning. Golden light immediately began to shine out of the
armored soldiers eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! The two
armored soldiers hoisted their weapons as they transformed into
streaks of light, charging towards Ning. “Die!” One of them
stabbed out with a longspear, sending it piercing through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The other
armored soldier lashed out with a long whip which moved like a long,
agile serpent. These two armored soldiers worked in concert, one
charging forward valiantly while the other moved with crafty agility.
They moved in perfect harmony, as though they were part of a greater
whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile.
“Interesting. No wonder Thunderheat said that these soldiers fight
in a very unique manner; they actually have employ a battle-formation
Dao, and are able to work together wonderfully…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! With but a
thought, Ning caused his sword-intent to manifest. His sword-intent
swept out in an overwhelming wave, smashing against the two soldiers
and sweeping them off their feet, then sending them flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was simply far too greater. These two soldiers were just barely
comparable to ordinary Daolords of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning blew through the soldiers like rotting wood, continuing to
advance through the pathway. Only after defeating 18,000 soldiers did
he finally begin to slow down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
feeling.” Ning was surrounded and being attacked by eight soldiers.
These eight soldiers used different weapons and different attack
styles. Hard, soft, insidious, straightforwards… every single
soldier was extremely dedicated to one type of combat style. And yet,
they were able to work together through their battle-formation. Ning
felt as though he was fighting a major power who was a mastery of
many different types of weapons. This was quite a taxing fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of Wind? The
Dao of Lightning? The Dao of Water?” Ning was growing increasingly
excited by this battle. As for the globe of light, it continued to
hang there in the void. Each time Ning defeated a soldier, it would
shoot out even more golden light and activate even more powerful
soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That light globe
should serve as the core of the entire Void Pathway.” Ning lifted
his head up to glance at the light globe. All of the soldiers were
unliving and inaminate things, but once the light shone down upon
them they were given incredible amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The items that can
be found in the Terror Starsea truly are marvelous.” Ning was
feeling increasingly curious about the Terror Starsea, but it was
simply too dangerous a place; not even the three mighty Hegemons
dared to go too deep into that place. It was so terrifying that even
they stood a chance of dying if they went too far in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flew on. Ten
thousand years went past in the blink of an eye. To cultivators, ten
thousand years was actually a very short period of time. The entire
Eastroad Sect remained in a state of disarray and fear of the
Ninedust Sect’s arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past ten
thousand years, Pillsaint had focused intently on training in the Dao
of Alchemy. As a result, he had finally broken through to become a
Daolord of the Second Step. With the first six chapters of the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters] serving to guide him, he knew exactly how to
progress in his Dao and so made incredibly rapid improvements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What will be, will
be.” Daolord Thunderheat’s face turned solemn after he heard his
disciple’s reports. A group of disciples had already been gathered
here within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect
has finally arrived.” The disciples all felt nervousness in their
hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lead him in,”
Daolord Thunderheat instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The disciple
who was responsible for bringing word from outside immediately
departed. As he did, Daolord Thunderheat’s avatar appeared in front
of the sculpture of a mountain, pushed the ‘door’ open, and
entered the Void Pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a battle
going on in the empty void of space directly above the actually
pathway. It was Daolord Naia and Flamefairy Su Youji battling each
other! There was a thatched cottage at one end of the area, and Ning
was seated in the lotus position within it as he meditated silently.
Ning had spent almost the entirety of the past ten thousand years
within the Void Pathway. He would often go out to engage in battle,
then use his spacetime cottage to train and reflect on his insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.” Daolord Thunderheat’s avatar walked over, then called
out to to Ning. Within the cottage, Ning opened his eyes and smiled.
“What is it, Daolord Thunderheat?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An envoy from the
Ninedust Sect has arrived,” Daolord Thunderheat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect?
They’ve finally come.” A cold glint flashed through Ning’s
eyes. He rose to his feet, walked out of the cottage, then waved his
hand and put it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
keep training here. I’ll go take a look,” Ning said loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Su
Youji and Daolord Naia both called back loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
immediately accompanied Daolord Thunderheat in leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the side halls
of the Eastroad Sect had been set up to welcome the Ninedust Sect’s
envoy. A large number of Eastroad Sect disciples had already gathered
here. As for Ning, he was brought in through a side door. He quietly
sat down in the back row and watched silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Envoy of the
Ninedust Sect, why have you come to the Eastroad Sect?” Daolord
Thunderheat spoke out from his position atop the high seat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple.” The
fiery-armored figure standing before him said coldly, “We’re here
giving you a chance to stay alive. If you immediately evacuate the
Eastroad Territory, all of you will be able to stay alive! But if you
fight back, you will be wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dares…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
disciples within the hall all began to roar and shout with fury. They
hadn’t imagined that the Ninedust Sect would act in such a brash
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was the Sectlord
who personally told me to convey this message. Either you get the
hell out of the Eastroad Sect or you die.” The fiery-armored man
said coldly, “I’ve delivered my message. It is up to you what
choice you will make. Ten years from now, if the Eastroad Sect is
still present in this region, then you can simply wait for death.”
Message delivered, he turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wants to leave,
just like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop right th-…”
An enraged disciple of the Eastroad Sect moved to block his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let him leave,”
Daolord Thunderheat said coldly. The Eastroad disciples had no choice
but to swallow their rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I train in a
cloning technique. Even if you killed me, it would be meaningless.”
The fiery-armored man let out a cold laugh, then left with a swagger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat
just watched him leave silently. He wasn’t going to get angry with
a World-level cultivator; it was the Ninedust Sectlord he was angry
with!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.” Daolord Thunderheat looked at the seated Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I saw everything.”
Ning nodded and smiled. “Let them come. I’ve been waiting over
ten thousand years here for the Ninedust Sect to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat
relaxed slightly. “Your words put me at ease, fellow Daoist.”

Chapter 6 – Battling Alone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering ray shrine
was floating there within the dark void of chaotic space, and an
awe-inspiring group of cultivators were inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the highest place
within the shrine sat a silver-maksed, silver-robed man. He was the
Ninedust Sectlord, and his name was known throughout the many
territories of the nearby region. Countless living beings prostrated
themselves before him and lived on his suffrage, and his vileness and
his power had long ago been made known to the cultivators around him,
inspiring terror in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below him stood three
figures who were the three vice sectlords of the Ninedust Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord.” Daolord
Graceful, one of the three vice sectlords, spoke out. “The ten
years have concluded, but the Eastroad Sect has refused to leave.
What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you really need
to ask? Of course we are going to attack. We’re going to wipe them
out!” Daolord Bruteflame, who had a stone-like body, roared
angrily, “Without Daolord Eastroad, how can the Eastroad Sect
possibly contend against our Ninedust Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
graceful and handsome Daolord Cleversoul frowned as he barked,
“Bruteflame, Ptariarch Eastroad was an extraordinarily powerful
figure, and his lair is undoubtedly filled with many terrifying
formations. We gave coercion a shot, and if we succeeded it would
have been nice, but… attack by force? Hmph. Only the Sectlord
himself has a shot at that. All three of us would be at risk of dying
if we tried.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three vice
sect-lords were Daolords of the Fourth Step, with Daolord Cleversoul
being the strongest and the other two being weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” The
Ninedust Sectlord said in a cold voice, “Since they have refused to
leave, we’ll take them out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three vice
sect-lords, especially Daolords Cleversoul and Graceful, were all
startled. Daolord Cleversoul barked, “The rest of you, retire for a
moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
other Daolords and World-level cultivators standing below them all
departed, despite feeling puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord.” Daolord
Cleversoul raised his head to look at the Ninedust Sectlord.
“Sectlord, are you perhaps being a bit too fixated on the Eastroad
Sect? You first slew one of their Daolords, then moved the entire
shrine over to the Eastroad Everworld to keep an eye over it… and
now, you plan to attack it by force! The Eastroad Sect is already
incredibly weak; we only need to besiege it, not actually attack it.
Eventually, they will have to come out, unless they choose to never
test themselves and never go out adventuring. If that is the case,
then their sect will grow weaker and weaker over time. In a few chaos
cycles, they’ll be finished. Why must we take the risk of attacking
by force?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Sectlord,
are we perhaps being a bit too hasty?” Daolord Graceful asked. They
all felt that this was a bit too impetuous. They could just take over
the entire Eastroad Territory while keeping the Eastroad Sect trapped
here! However, the Sectlord insisted on actually attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. Now that the old
Sectlord has passed away, the three of you must feel that I’m the
easygoing, merciful type, yes? You believe there is no need to obey
my orders, mm?” The Ninedust Sectlord’s voice was as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We wouldn’t dare,”
the three vice sectlords said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you do not
dare to disobey, go and carry out my orders. Head out to the Eastroad
Sect,” the Ninedust Sectlord barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.” The
three vice sectlords had no choice but to obey the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Head out to the
Eastroad Sect.” Soon, the order spread to the entire sect, and the
towering gray shrine began to fly ever-closer to the Eastroad
Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering gray
shrine pierced through the world-membrane of the Eastroad Sect, then
soared through its skies like an enormous levitating mountain as it
moved straight to the Eastroad Sect. It made no effort to disguise or
hide what it was doing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
Ninedust Sect’s shrine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Shrine
of the Ninedust Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few cultivators
within the Eastroad Everworld raised their heads to stare at it,
their hearts filled with shock. They knew that something big was
about to happen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move, move, move!
Head out right away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
Eastroad Sect and watch what happens from a safe distance. This
battle between the Ninedust Sect and the Eastroad Sect will be the
biggest fight in many chaos cycles in these territories. There’s no
way we can miss it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastroad Sect is
probably going to be wiped out. There’s no way we can miss this
spectacle. Given what a deep foundation the Eastroad Sect has
accumulated over the years, it probably won’t die without a fight.
I’m guessing that one or two of the Daolords of the Ninedust Sect
will die as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These cultivators all
chatted excitedly amongst themselves as they quietly flew towards the
Eastroad Sect, preparing to watch this battle. If they missed a fight
like this, they would be filled with endless regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect is
coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect
has brought its main base, the Ninedust Shrine.” Word quickly
spread like wildefire within the Eastroad Sect, and it was filled
with a hubbub of commotion. Many of its disciples were shocked and
restless. Although they had long ago known that a day like this would
come, and that someone known as Daolord Darknorth had come to assist
them… they couldn’t help but feel nervous and fearful now that
the day had finally arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sect’s
power was simply too great! Its fame and its might were all legendary
throughout the nearby territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth! Fellow Daoist Darknorth!” Daolord Thunderheat headed
straight to the Void Pathway to ask Ning to assist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have they arrived?”
Ning, Pillsaint, Su Youji, and Naia all came out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The main base of the
Ninedust Sect, the ‘Ninedust Shrine’, is flying straight towards
us.” Daolord Thunderheat cleared his throat, obviously rather
nervous. “They aren’t trying to do a blitzkrieg through
teleportation or anything sneaky; they are just flying straight
towards us! I imagine many cultivators have already noticed them. The
Ninedust Sect is completely confident in its chances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “No need
to panic. From this moment forwards, you must obey all my orders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Daolord
Thunderheat nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go meet the
Ninedust Sect outside our sect.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outside the sect?”
Daolord Thunderheat was shocked. “You can’t. If you go outside,
you won’t be protected by the formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I am not a match
for them, then I’ll naturally retreat into the protective embrace
of the Eastroad Sect’s formations.” Ning smiled. “Don’t
worry. I won’t get in over my head.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unable to dissuade
Ning, Daolord Thunderheat could only say, “Fellow Daoist Darknorth,
you must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll leave the
defenses and formations protecting the Eastroad Sect to you, Daolord.
Maintaining control over its formations will be critical to this
fight,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
that at all,” Daolord Thunderheat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
glance at Naia, Pillsaint, and Su Youji, then smiled. “There’s no
need for the three of you to participate in this fight. Would you
like to enter my estate-world, or to watch from the outside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m watching, of
course,” Su Youji said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could I miss a
fight like this?” Pillsaint shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Naia didn’t
say anything. She just stood next to Su Youji and looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Might
as well. However, if things get dangerous you need to enter my
estate-world. All of you are too weak, after all; once the real fight
starts, the Ninedust Sectlord will probably wipe you all out with a
single strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, they just
weren’t strong enough. Ning had both the Hegemon’s armor as well
as a powerful protective divine ability, and he also had his nine
novessence arts. This was why he dared to clash against figures like
Kongsan and the Ninedust Sectlord. Daolords like Naia would be
finished in one blow. The difference in power was simply too great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of us will
listen to your orders, Master,” Su Youji promised right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’m going to
go now.” Ning nodded as he flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat, Su
Youji, and the disciples of the Eastroad Sect all watched as Ning
left, their hearts filled with nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just worried
that this Daolord Darknorth will be killed by the Ninedust Sect in an
instant. If that happens, we really will be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing
else we can do. We have to place our faith in Daolord Darknorth.”
The Eastroad Sect’s disciples really were out of options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked out of the
Eastroad Sect, then scanned the surrounding area. Upon seeing a
distant mountain peak a few hundred kilometers away, he took a single
step forwards and moved to stand at the very top of that mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this battle has
finally come.” Ning sat down upon a boulder atop the mountain peak,
staring at the distant horizons. A hint of fire could be seeing
flickering in his eyes… a burning desire to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve now made
breaks through in all five Supreme Daos that comprise my Omega Sword
Dao. However, I’ve failed with each attempt I make to merge them
together into an even stronger Omega Sword Dao.” Ning frowned. The
Void Pathway had actually been quite helpful to him. Prior to coming
to the Eastroad Sect, Ning had only made breakthroughs in two of his
Supreme Daos: the Blood Drop sword-intent and the Yin-Yang
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The breakthrough in the
Yin-Yang sword-intent had come in a natural fashion as he hastened
towards the Eastroad Sect after his battle against Daolord Kongsan.
As for the other three Supreme Daos, he had made those breakthroughs
during the ten thousand years he had spent in the Void Pathway. Alas,
to use them to form an even higher-level Omega Sword Dao required
that brief moment of epiphany, a eureka moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, one
simply cannot reach the apex through cultivation alone. Perhaps this
fight will give me a chance to gain the insight I need to make a
breakthrough in my Omega Sword Dao. Once I master my second-stage
Omega Sword Dao, I’ll be able to become a Daolord of the Second
Step.” Ning eagerly awaited that moment. He was slightly more
powerful than he had been when he had battled Kongsan, but he hadn’t
made any truly transformative breakthroughs. He was in desperate need
of something to stimulate him into making a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the towering
gray shrine finally appeared in the horizons as it flew towards the
Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect
has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are here.”
Many cultivators were hidden off in the distance, having teleported
to arrive in advance of the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering gray
shrine suddenly came to a halt in midair. The Daolords of the
Ninedust Sect and its cultivators all stared off into the distance,
as did the Ninedust Sectlord atop his throne. Their gazes almost
instantly turned towards the mountain peak which was almost directly
in front of the Eastroad Sect. There was a white-robed youth with a
black sheath on his back who was on that mountain peak, and the youth
rose to his feet and stared right back at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Second Step?” The Ninedust Sectlord murmured softly, “A puny
little Daolord of the Second Step actually dares to block our advance
towards the Eastroad Sect… to block my Ninedust Sect?”
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___Attack"></A>
Chapter 7 – Attack!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord.” Daolord
Clevermind looked at the Ninedust Sectlord. “This man is a mere
Daolord of the Second Step. He knows that we have come, but he
actually dares to stand in front of their gates. He clearly is
treating us as an enemy. Hmph. Let us send one of our brothers to
wipe him out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Ninedust
Sectlord calmly assented. Given his status, how could he possibly
hold a mere Daolord of the Second Step in any regard?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Huzhen.”
Daolord Clevermind immediately glanced downwards. “I’ll have to
trouble you to get rid of this Daolord of the Second Step! You are
our first attacker, and as such you need to be decisive in this
victory. Shock and awe them. Make sure they know that submission and
surrender is the correct decision, and that defiance leads only to
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Daolord Huzhen said respectfully. He was one of the sect’s three
Daolords of the Third Step, and was quite a formidable fighter.
Whoosh! Daolord Huzhen immediately flew out of the Ninedust Shrine
and towards the distant mountain peak with Ji Ning on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That white-robed
youth actually dares to stand in front of the Eastroad Sect and block
the Ninedust Sect’s path. He’s being a bit too brash, isn’t
he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my senses are
correct, he appears to merely be a Daolord of the Second Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators
watching from afar were all staring at Ning curiously. Now that the
Ninedust Shrine had descended upon this place, it made no sense for a
Daolord of the Second Step to stand in its path. It was like a
cricket trying to stand in the path of a carriage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll all be up to
Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if Daolord
Darknorth really is as powerful as he claims or if he is just
bragging. No matter what, I just don’t feel safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just watch
and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of the
Eastroad Sect were all quite nervous, especially when they saw that
towering shrine hang in the air right in front of them. Would Daolord
Darknorth really be able to stand up to them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth…” Daolord Thunderheat watched silently. He was more
nervous than anyone else, as it was up to him to defend and run the
entire Eastroad Sect. He was the one who had chosen to trust Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
top of the mountain peak, watching as a Daolord flew towards him with
robes fluttering in the air. The Daolord called out from afar, “I
am Daolord Huzhen of the Ninedust Sect. Listen up, kid. The Ninedust
Sect has come to tame and subdue the Eastroad Sect. How dare you
stand in our way and cause trouble for us? Are you really tired of
living? I’ll give you a chance to live; submit to us right away and
join us, and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise… today is the day
you die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice boomed out
and echoed within the skies. Clearly, he was doing this to put on a
great show. As Daolord Clevermind had instructed, he was going to
shock and awe the Eastroad Sect, with the ideal outcome being
terrifying them into surrender.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
stood there atop the mountain, a smile of amusement on his face as
his own voice echoed through the skies as well. “Daolord Huzhen,
yes? If you wish to submit to me, I’ll accept you as a retainer. If
you attack, you’ll die here and now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a joke. Go to
your death, then!” Daolord Huzhen let out an angry laugh, then
pointed from afar. Boom! A series of wooden planks appeared in the
skies, culimating in over a thousand planks. Every single plank was
covered with complex divine runes; clearly, this was a set of
extremely powerful magic treasures. The divine runes began to
tremble, causing the thousand-plus wooden planks to instantly form
into a stream of azure sword-light that slashed through the heavens
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly shook his
head. Just as the azure streak of sword-light reached his body, he
waved his hand. Boom! The azure sword-light was actually blasted
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The distant
Daolord Huzhen’s face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” Ning’s
gaze turned cold. Instantly, the world around them began to darken as
streams of sword-intent appeared out of thin air. The terrifying
sword-intent condensed into sword-light that swirled around Daolord
Huzhen, and then… swish! The sword-light ground him apart like
countless millstones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…” Daolord
Huzhen had a look of horror on his face. He wanted to use his magic
treasures to defend, but… splat. The thousands of streaks of
sword-light swirled around him and ground away at his body,
splintering his divine body and distintegrating his truesoul. He died
on the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a single step
forwards, moving through the skies to stand next to the place where
Daolord Huzhen had died. With a wave of his hand, he took the
treasures which Daolord Huzhen had left behind. A powerful wind was
blowing through the skies, stirring his robes. Ning wanted to make
use of this battle to find a way to further improve his Omega Sword
Dao. How could he possibly be wary of combat?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
raised his head to stare at the distant, towering gray shrine. He
said in a cold voice, “Ninedust Sect, if you leave right now you’ll
be able to keep your lives. Otherwise… I’ll kill as many as dare
trespass on the grounds of the Eastroad Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill as many as dare
trespass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill as many as dare
trespass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was filled
with Immortal energy and echoed throughout the skies, reverberating
throughout the world. The distant cultivators watching this from afar
were all stunned by this. The disciples of the Eastroad Sect and
Daolord Thunderheat were speechless, and the major powers and
cultivators of the Ninedust Sect were the most shocked of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He was able to
slay a Daolord of the Third Step with nothing more than manifested
sword-intent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t even use
those swords in the black sheath on his back. He didn’t even enter
close combat, nor did he use any magic treasures. His sword-intent
alone was enough to slay a Daolord of the Third Step?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is no ordinary
Daolord of the Second Step. He’s one of the most freakishly
powerful Daolords of the Second Step in existence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
stunned. The Eastroad Sect now understood that Daolord Darknorth
truly did have a terrifying level of power! As for the Ninedust Sect,
it now understood that the white-robed youth before them would be the
greatest impediment to their designs over the Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Huzhen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huzhen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A number of anguished
cries rang out from within the Ninedust Shrine, with the cultivators
in question filled with rage. As for the Ninedust Sectlord, he let
out a soft laugh from atop his throne. “Interesting. It seems this
Daolord of the Second Step does have a few skills to rely on. Still…
in the end, he is just a Daolord of the Second Step. Clevermind,
Graceful, Bruteflame, do not be overconfident. We need to smash
through the Eastroad Sect like rotting wood. All three of you should
simultaneously attack and crush this Daolord of the Second Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All three of us,
attack together?” Daolord Graceful couldn’t help but want to
confirm this. They were different from Daolord Huzhen, as the power
gap between Daolords of the Third Step and Daolords of the Fourth
Step was quite significant. To reach the fourth step meant that you
were a major power who had virtually reached the absolute apex of a
certain personal Dao. Daolord Clevermind in particular possessed
incredible power, and was capable of killing ordinary Daolords of the
Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is enough for
Bruteflame and myself to attack,” Daolord Graceful said. “If we
work together, we can deal with even the most freakishly powerful
Daolords of the Second Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The Ninedust
Sectlord shook his head. “Let’s not waste any more time on a
Daolord of the Second Step. All three of you should attack
simultaneously and let the Eastroad Sect understand that resistance
is futile.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Daolord Clevermind, Daolord Graceful, and Daolord Bruteflame all
assented respectfully. If the sectlord had made up his mind, then
they wouldn’t dare to argue any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Daolord Clevermind barked, then transformed into a streak of light
that flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Daolords Graceful and Bruteflame followed behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All three vice
sectlords are attacking. Even if this Daolord of the Second Step is
one of the most legendary of geniuses, he’s definitely going to
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three vice
sectlords are probably enough to crush the entire Eastroad Sect by
themselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many cultivators
within the Ninedust Shrine were filled with complete confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the three flew out
from the shrine, the skies instantly darkened around them. Rumble…
a terrifying, endless streak of saber-light filled the skies, and at
its edges was an aura of gray mist as well as boundless flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Saber-light, mist, and
flames. They filled the skies for countless kilometers around in a
manifestation of the might of the Dao of the three. The three vice
sectlords had been famous in the surrounding territories for
countless years now, and the manifestation of their Dao alone was
enough to stun everyone present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect is
actually sending out all three of its vice sectlords at the same
time? This is a bit much, isn’t it? For a Daolord of the Fourth
Step to fight against a Daolord of the Second Step is already
bullying. Three against one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t
bullying. This is a war between the Ninedust Sect and the Eastroad
Sect. This Daolord has only himself to blame for daring to get
involved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust Sect
wants to crush this Daolord in an instant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the distant
spectators, especially the ones belonging to the organizations of the
surrounding territories, were scouts who had been placed here long
ago. They couldn’t help but shake their heads and sigh. They knew
just how terrifyingly strong the three vice sectlords of the Ninedust
Sect were. Every single one of them was incredibly formidable. All
three at once? None of them believed the white-robed kid had a
chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Standing
there in the air, Ning let out a cold snort. Rumble… endless
amounts of sword-light filled the skies like a great flood,
blanketing the heavens as they smashed towards the saber-light, the
mist, and the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The saber-light, the
mist, and the flames were hurtling from one direction, while Ning’s
ocean of sword-light came crashing from the other. The two curtains
of power quickly collided. The blurry mist and the frenzied flames
were instantly suppressed, while the frenzied saber-light clashed
repeatedly in the air against Ning’s sword-light, neither able to
gain an advantage over the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The might of their
respective Daos continued clashed against each other. As for the
three vice sectlords, they stared in the air towards Ning. By now,
they realized that they had encountered a truly tough foe.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 – Sharpened
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides stared at
each other from afar. This clash of Daos alone let the three vice
sectlords know that in terms of insights into the Dao, this mere
Daolord of the Second Step was already on par with Daolord Clevermind
and superior to the other two vice sectlords! This caused their ardor
to cool down. However, they remained full of confidence. There would
be an enormous difference in amount of divine power and Immortal
energy, after all; one was a Daolord of the Second Step, the others
were Daolords of the Fourth Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack,” Daolord
Clevermind shouted mentally to the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAWR!” Daolord
Bruteflame raised his head and let out a bellow as his stony body
suddenly expanded. He transformed into an enormous stone titan that
was ten million kilometers tall, and his two giant stone legs slammed
into the ground like the pillars of heaven themselves, causing the
earth to tremble. His two arms seemed to contain the power to
annihilate the heavens as he sent them smashing towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.” One
of the Northbow swords flew out from Ji Ning’s back, falling into
his hands. He transformed into the [Three Heads, Six Arms] form, all
six of his arms clenched around the hilt of this sword. His sword
suddenly expanded to become massive as well, and his six arms swung
it outwards in a furious chop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omega Sword Dao –!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had made
breakthroughs in all five of his Supreme Daos. Although he hadn’t
been able to merge them together into a higher-level Omega Sword Dao,
his total combat power had still improved by a bit. He was now on par
with Patriarch Clearwind in every respect, be it in using quick
sword-arts, fierce sword-arts, or unpredictable sword-arts. In fact,
his perfection in every area was such that his sword-arts would be
enough to force Patriarch Clearwind to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The massive
streak of sword-light slammed into those two enormous,
heaven-overturning arms which brimmed with flames. An enormous
explosion blasted out, and Ning couldn’t help but take two steps
back. As for the giant stone titan, Daolord Bruteflame, he stumbled
one step back as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Bruteflame
lives up to his reputation as an Aberrant special lifeform. The star
maps of the Brightshore Kingdom described him as an Aberrant famous
for his strength. However, he’s weak in terms of speed and
technique,” Ning amused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? A Daolord of
the Second Step was actually able to fight Bruteflame head on?”
Daolord Graceful was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Clevermind’s face paled. He knew very well that even if he struck
at full power, he would still be at a disadvantage when fighting
Daolord Bruteflame head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be up to
you, Daolord Clevermind,” Daolord Graceful sent mentally. An
incredibly dense black mist suddenly arose that instantly covered the
surrounding area which could not be dispersed by the aura of Ning’s
Dao. Something seemed to be swimming within that dark mist that
almost instantly shot out towards the opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, a competition in
using soft, Yin principles?” Ning’s six Northbow swords all shot
out of the sheath, and he wielded one in each of his six arms,
sending sword-light flowing outwards and easily defending against the
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” The
most powerful of the three, Daolord Clevermind, charged straight
towards Ning with six warhammers in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face
tightened. Although Daolord Clevermind’s name implied trickery, his
combat style was absolutely savage and dominating, but in a different
way from how Daolord Bruteflame merely used brute force. Daolord
Clevermind didn’t seem to have any obvious flaws at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent. The
Ninedust Sect is giving me just what I want. I was hoping to have a
chance to tussle a bit against comparable foes and see if I can’t
perhaps evolve my Omega Sword Dao.” Ning revealed a smile. “Who
would’ve thought they’d choose to send their three vice sectlords
out to spar?” Three of them at the same time would give even Ning
some pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this!”
Ning charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Daolord
Clevermind shot straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The distant
Daolord Graceful controlled his magic treasures from afar, sending
long-range attacks against Ning. He was a Ki Refiner and so wasn’t
all that skilled in close combat. As for Daolord Bruteflame, he sent
his giant fists smashing towards Ning time and time again, each
strike comparable to Ning’s Omega Heavenbreaker attack. Ning had to
be wary of him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a time, the scene
outside the Eastroad Sect was a scene of complete chaos. Black mist
swirled everywhere, and an enormous titan was launching frenzied
attacks in every direction. At the center of the action was the
battle between the number one vice sectlord of the Ninedust Sect,
Daolord Clevermind… and a white-robed youth. Thunder and lightning
crackled through the air as the giant warhammers linked together into
a cage of lightning around Ning, whose six swords struck out with
unfathomable, mysterious power. Sometimes, they were as unfathomable
as swimming dragons; at other times, they were as explosive as
volcanos. In every aspect, he was as strong as Daolord Clevermind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Daolord
Graceful and Daolord Bruteflame continued to launch attacks from the
sidelines, causing Ning to be distracted and making it so that he
seemed to be consistently at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This white-robed
Daolord really is powerful. He’s actually able to fight the three
vice sectlords of the Ninedust Sect to a standstill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive. For a
Daolord of the Second Step to possess such power means that he is
definitely one of the most freakishly powerful of Daolords around.
I’ve heard of such monsters in the past, but I’ve never seen any
of them. I’ve really seen something special today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. It seems it
won’t be that easy for the Ninedust Sect to take over the Eastroad
Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant spectator
cultivators, especially the spies from other organizations, all
murmured silently to each other. With this white-robed Daolord
present, conquering the Eastroad Sect would be no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be
trouble.” The Ninedust Sectlord frowned as he watched from afar.
Taking over the Eastroad Sect really wouldn’t be that easy. This
kid was clearly just a Daolord of the Second Step, but he was already
on par with Daolord Clevermind in power. In the outside world, the
Ninedust Sectlord wouldn’t care about him at all, but there was no
way this white-robed Daolord would be so foolish as to engage the
Ninedust Sectlord in close combat. No Daolord of such power could
possibly be as foolish as that! Once the Ninedust Sectlord got
involved, the white-robed Daolord would probably retreat into the
protective embrace of the Eastroad Sect’s formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once he was being
reinforced by the formations personally left behind by Patriarch
Eastroad, things would be completely different. The Ninedust Sectlord
wasn’t confident in being able to slay that white-robed Daolord
inside the Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only when the difference in power between two sects was absolutely
enormous would one be able to take over the other. Usually, the
protective formations covering each set would be enough to offset any
difference in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
truly is powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually able
to fight three at once and stop all three of their vice sectlords!
With power like this… if he’s reinforced by our formations, he’ll
probably be able to stop the Ninedust Sectlord.” The disciples
within the Ninedust Sect were all rather excited. Although it looked
as though Daolord Darknorth was at a disadvantage in this fight, for
him to be able to resist all three at once was a testament to his
strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thunderheat had
a look of joy on his face, but he then suddenly frowned. “Wait. I
remember Daolord Darknorth saying that he was able to defeat Daolord
Naia in a single blow, thanks to his secret arts. Why haven’t I
seen him use any secret arts yet?” Ning had mentioned previously
that his greatest power lay in his secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he’s already
this powerful in close combat, how much stronger will he be once he
uses those secret arts?” Daolord Thunderheat didn’t even dare
imagine it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Again!” Ning was battling to his
heart’s content. He could’ve used the nine novessence arts to end
this long ago, but that would be boring. If all he wanted to do was
to turtle up, he could’ve stayed inside the sect. The reason he
came out was because he wanted to fight, to temper himself, to
sharpen his skills and enhance his Omega Sword Dao! This battle
against the three vice sectlords was doing just that, and Daolord
Clevermind in particular was giving him a great deal of pressure. He
naturally was gaining a few insights into sword-arts as the battle
continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! Wonderful.
Just wonderful!” Daolord Clevermind was enjoying the fight as well,
battling with incomparable valor. He was a practitioner of the Dao of
Lightning, and was skilled in high-speed explosive attacks. “Kid,
you might be able to maintain your current level of power thanks to
whatever divine ability you are using, but I want to see how long
you’ll be able to hold it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once more time
passes, he won’t be able to hold on.” Daolord Bruteflame and
Daolord Graceful were filled with confidence as well. They all felt
certain that this white-roed Daolord had to be relying on some sort
of divine ability which allowed him to release an explosive amount of
power… but the more monstrously powerful a divine ability was, the
faster it depleted one’s divine power. Generally speaking, this
sort of battle strategy could not be used for a long period of time.
They had no idea that in a contest of endurance, Ning was superior to
all three of them combined because his azureflower mist energy was
only used up at an extremely slow rate… and he had an enormous
amount of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
nearly an hour had gone by without the battle slowing down in the
slightest. An hour was a very short period of time for cultivators,
and the watching spectators were all quite excited by the spectacle.
However, the three vice sectlords and the Ninedust Sectlor knew the
truth of the matter, and they all felt something was off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he last
for this long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has his divine
power been able to last this long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
and the three vice sectlords all had a bad feeling. But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still not
quite there.” Ning secretly shook his head. “Although I’ve
gained many new ideas regarding my sword-arts, to merge my five
Supreme Daos of the ‘second step’ level into a new Omega Sword
Dao is still not possible. It seems these three vice sectlords simply
aren’t giving me enough pressure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t want to
continue the fight against the three of them any longer, because they
had already put all of their techniques on full display. It was no
longer of any use to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it end!” Ning
willed it, and nine absolutely terrifying ‘dragons’ of
destructive energy began to fly out from his body…
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 – The Sectlord Attacks
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine dragons coiled
around each other, manifesting into a series of awesome waves through
the mysteries of Ji Ning’s Omega Sword Dao that came crashing
outwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh no.” Daolord
Clevermind had been in close combat with Ning, and his face instantly
turned pale. He could sense the terrifying power contained within
those nine mighty secret arts. “This white-robed Daolord was
actually hiding terrifying secret arts up his sleeve.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Daolord
Clevermind’s six great warhammers suddenly shone with complex runes
that flowed across its surface, forming shields across the surfaces
of each warhammer. Soon, six bizarre shields of lightning had been
formed that then joined together, resulting into a complete and
seamless shield-barrier of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
nine novessence arts came crashing down upon the shield-barrier of
light, but the lightning shield was able to hold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I had
this treasure. Otherwise, I would’ve ended up losing my life! I
need to flee right away.” Daolord Clevermind’s face was still
pale. He immediate commanded his shields to surround him and quickly
soared into the skies, retreating at more than fifty times the speed
of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These six warhammers
were no ordinary treasures. It must be understood that outside the
Endless Territories lay the Great Dark. Daolord Clevermind had often
enjoyed standing at the borders of the Endless Territories and
staring into the Great Dark, because it made him feel calm and at
peace, which helped him better understand his own Dao of the Saber.
One day, while cultivating at the borders of the Great Dark, he had
discovered those six great warhammers just floating there. They had
been floating through the Great Dark for countless years, but they
remained in perfect condition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he had acquired
these six warhammers, Daolord Clevermind quickly discovered how
incredible and special they were. They were innately heavy beyond
compare, and their attacks were utterly ruinous to their foes. It
must be understood that if Patriarch Clearwind once more fought Ning
in a head-on clash, he would now be forced to flee within a short
period of time. Daolord Clevermind was merely on par with Patriarch
Clearwind, but he was able to fight Ning to a standstill primarily
because of how extraordinary these six warhammers were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When defending, he
could use them to form an absolute defense of lightning. When
fleeing, they would envelop him him and allow him to move at a
hundred times the speed of light. The only reason why he was moving
slower than that was because of the nine novessence arts attacking
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had
acquired the six warhammers, Daolord Clevermind understood that they
had to have been items of great might left behind by an ancient
power, perhaps even a top-tier Eternal Emperor. After acquiring them,
his status within the sect became even firmer than it was before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Graceful was a Ki Refiner and as such battled from afar. When he saw
those nine dragon-like streams of novessence energy appear, he
instantly understood that he was in mortal danger. Even his magic
treasures were blasted away by those nine streams of energy, causing
him to lose control over them. “If those things so much as touch
me, I’m finished. I need to get the hell out of here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Graceful
gritted his teeth, then produced a black disc-shaped Dao-seal which
was covered with layers of strange rippling runes, then crushed it.
Swoosh. Instantly several streaks of black light circled around him…
and just like that, he was teleported away and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
The towering Aberrant stone giant, ‘Daolord Bruteflame’, let out
agonized screams as his stony body was rent asunder by those nine
novessence arts. He was completely incapable of withstanding the
assault, and his towering, ten million kilometer long body quickly
crumbled to become nothing more than a boulder-sized head. A look of
despair was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had almost
instantly activated his nine novessence arts. Everything had happened
far too quickly, giving the distant Ninedust Sectlord no time to
intervene as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
“Two actually managed to escape? The battle we were just in caused
distortions in spacetime, making it impossible to teleport out
through normal means. Daolord Graceful, however, seemed to flee using
some sort of Dao-seal. I didn’t expect that someone as unremarkable
and low-key as him would actually be hiding such marvelous treasures
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had predicted that
Daolord Clevermind might be able to escape from his killing blow;
given how strong the man was, he most assuredly had some life-saving
trump cards up his sleeves. But who would’ve thought that Daolord
Graceful would also be able to produce such a rare item?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Clevermind’s
six great warhammers are unquestionably weapons of extraordinary
power. They were actually able to block my nine novessence arts
head-on! For Kongsan or the Ninedust Sectlord to do that would be one
thing, but who would’ve thought Clevermind would also be capable of
it? Those six warhammers truly are marvelous; they even allow him to
flee at incredible speeds!” Ning couldn’t help but sigh at how
extraordinary those things were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although many thoughts
flickered through Ning’s mind, his hands moved at lightning speed
as he hurled out a black gourd that flew straight towards the stony
form of Daolord Bruteflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Bruteflame,
either submit to me or die to me.” Ning stared at Daolord
Bruteflame’s stony head, the only part of him which was left
undamaged. “Choose immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“S-submit!” Daolord
Bruteflame was utterly terrified, and he made his choice without
hesitate. Swoosh! The head flew straight towards the black gourd and
the field of novessence energy around it, shrinking as it quickly
disappeared into the gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s face had tightened as soon as he saw Ning use
those nine novessence arts. Battles between Daolords happened at
incredible speeds, making it impossible for him to save Daolord
Bruteflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
almost instantly charge out of his shrine, a dark-red longstaff
appearing in his hands and almost immediately expanding over a
hundred million kilometers. He swung out with the longstaff, sending
it smashing towards the incredibly distant Ning as though it was one
of the pillars of the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! When the staff
swept out, the world itself seemed to turn dark. When it clashed
against the nine novessence arts, the energy flows of the novessence
arts were thrown into a state of chaos. However, the nine novessence
arts were formless to begin with, and so they quickly returned back
to normal as the staff continued to smash towards Ning at high
speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity.”
Faced with a terrifying staff-strike, Ning merely glanced sideways at
the fleeing Daolord Clevermind, who was escaping thanks to his
protective cage of lightning. Daolord Clevermind was fleeing at more
than fifty times the speed of light right now, but if Ning used his
own flying vessel he’d be able to catch the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem was, given
how the thunderhammer cage was able to defend against even the nine
novessence arts, it would undoubtedly be hard for Ning to breach it
with any of his other attacks. His only choice was to rely on his
superior azureflower mist energy to slowly fight a war of attrition
which he might win, with time… but there was no time for that. The
Ninedust Sectlord had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then. I want
to see just how strong figures like the Ninedust Sectlord or Daolord
Kongsan are in close combat.” Ning could sense that he had improved
somewhat since the battle at Skywood City, while his strengthened
nine novessence arts would be able to hamper and weaken his foe’s
staff-arts. It seemed likely that Ning would be able to at least give
the man a good fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!”
Ning gripped a single sword with all six arms, then unleashed the
Heavenbreaker stance of his Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The obliterating
staff collided head-on with the heaven-breaking sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense a
surge of incomparably vast and powerful energy smash into him from
the collision. Even after the Hegemon armor ablated most of the power
of the blow, he was still sent flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually didn’t
die?” The silver-faced, silver-robed Ninedust Sectlord was rather
surprised. “Hmph. Then take another hit from me.” He charged
straight into the awesome field of novessence energy, and the power
of this field caused him to feel even more surprised. He could sense
his own speed dropping rapidly, but he was still able to endure the
attacks. He couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. “This is a tough
foe. His secret arts are even stronger than mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle was simply
happening too fast. Daolord Bruteflame was captured alive, Daolord
Graceful disappeared without a trace, while Daolord Clevermind had
fled in terror. A heartbeat later, the Ninedust Sectlord had
attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What technique was
that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three vice
sectlords were defeated in one strike. Even the Ninedust Sectlord has
entered the fray.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has to be some
sort of secret art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps the
unleashed of some ancient power’s Dao-seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant spectators
as well as the Ninedust cultivators all watched both nervously and
intently. This was all happening too fast, and it might end if they
so much as blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was not surprised
by how fearlessly the Ninedust Sectlord charged into the flood of
novessence energies. Daolord Kongsan had been able to withstand his
nine novessence arts as well, after all. For the Ninedust Sectlord to
be able to resist it made sense, as he was on par with ordinary
Eternal Emperors in power. “Hmph. Once my Omega Sword Dao reaches a
higher level, my nine novessence arts will be dramatically
strengthened as well. By then it won’t be this easy for you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… I’m
still much weaker than figures like Kongsan and Ninedust in a head-on
fight. His staff had lost 30-40% of its power when it went through my
novessence arts, I think.” Ning had been smashed so far back that
he had been sent flying to the very edge’s of the Eastroad Sect’s
formations. Even his body felt slightly numb… and this was after
the Hegemon armor had absorbed most of the impact! If he dind’t
have the Hegemon armor, he probably would’ve died or suffered heavy
wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The Ninedust
Sectlord charged straight towards Ning, his eyes burning with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Let’s
continue this fight inside the Eastroad Sect.” Ning let out a
grinning chuckle, then retreated backwards and entered the protective
embrace of the Eastroad Sect’s formations. In the outside world, he
had been blown backwards even with the support of his nine novessence
arts. There was simply no way for him to fight a battle there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. How impressive
can the formations which Eastroad set up be?” The Ninedust Sectlord
didn’t hesitate at all. Longstaff in his hands, he smashed a hole
through the protective barriers and charged straight inside the
Eastroad Sect.

Chapter 10 – Breakthrough – Daolord of the Second Step
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m inside.” A
hint of excitement flickered through the Ninedust Sectlord’s eyes
after he charged into the Eastroad Sect. He could sense fate calling
straight to him. “I can sense it with increasing clarity now. Hmph.
I might’ve been afraid to come here when Patriarch Eastroad was
alive, but does this puny Daolord of the Second Step really think he
can stop me, even if he is freakishly talented? What a joke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Emperor’s
Numerancy divinations were spot on. My destiny does indeed reside
within this territory. All the effort I put into seizing the position
of sectlord in the Ninedust Sect was worth it.” The Ninedust
Sectlord’s mind was filled with many thoughts, but he showed no
mercy at all when he attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!” The
longstaff in his hands swept out. Boom! Boom! Boom! It was like an
endless sea of water was bellowing towards the skies, with his
longstaff containing multiple waves of destructive energy which
wantonly struck out against everything within the Eastroad Sect. His
longstaff caused palaces to crumble, walls to collapse, and
courtyards to shatter. His entrance and his attack was so sudden that
some of the spectating disciples of the Eastroad Sect weren’t able
to flee in time. Eleven of them were killed instantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide immediately!”
Daolord Thunderheat was shocked; the Ninedust Sectlord’s attack had
simply been too fast! “Hide behind me!” As he spoke, he hurriedly
took control over the formations of the Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a hissing sound,
the many formations inside the Eastroad Sect were all simultaneously
activated alongside the most powerful defensive barriers. One tendril
of golden flame after another began to appear, then converge upon the
Eastroad Sectlord like an endless stream of golden serpents. Each
individual serpent seemed unremarkable, but the Ninedust Sectlord’s
face tightened when he saw them. “Patriarch Eastroad really was
willing to spare no expense in setting up such an enormous
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Barging into another
major power’s base was an extremely risky maneuver. He had long ago
desired to enter this place, but so long as Patriarch Eastroad was
alive and his avatar stood guard over this place there was no way the
Ninedust Sectlord would dare trespass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here, right
away!” Daolord Thunderheat hurriedly waved his hand, taking his
various disciples and placing them into his own estate-world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you
should stop watching as well.” Ning moved next to Su Youji,
Pillsaint, and Naia, a solemn look on his face. “Daolord
Thunderheat and I are not certain as to what powers the Ninedust
Sectlord possesses. He might unleash some sort of overwhelmingly
powerful killer blow that will annihilate you merely as collateral
damage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
and the others didn’t want to leave their lives up to luck, and so
they all nodded obediently. Ning waved his hand, causing Su Youji,
Pillsaint, and Naia to be instantly drawn into his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, only three
living creatures were left within the Eastroad Sect; all others had
been drawn away into estate-worlds. The three were the Ninedust
Sectlord, Ji Ning, and Daolord Thunderheat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, Daolord
Thunderheat,” Ning sent mentally. Daolord Thunderheat couldn’t
hide; he had to stay out here to control the formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’ll
stay far away from the two of you, and the formations inside the
Eastroad Sect will make it impossible for the Ninedust Sectlord to
even sense where I am. If I still end up dying accidentally somehow,
I’ll have only my poor bad luck to blame.” A frenzied look was in
Daolord Thunderheat’s eyes. “Fellow Daoist Darknorth, the rest is
up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That direction over
there.” The Ninedust Sectlord turned to follow the silent whispers
of fate, moving deeper into the Eastroad Sect while continuing to
defend against the golden serpents and leaving absolute destruction
in his wake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust Sectlord, I
might not be a match for you in the outside world… but for you to
charge into the Eastroad Sect is far too brash.” Ning once more
revealed himself, his nine novessence arts at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A desire to do battle
could be seen in Ning’s eyes. Experts like the Ninedust Sectlord
held profound levels of insight into the Dao and gave Ning a
completely different type of pressure in battle, making it easier for
him to gain insights into his own Dao. However, under normal
circumstances a battle against such a figure would be incredibly
dangerous; the slightest miscalculation might result in death. The
only reason Ning was able to fight him now was because the formations
of the Eastroad Sect were helping him out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! A streak of
sword-light flew out towards the Ninedust Sectlord, whose face
tightened slightly. “Damn. It’s that irritating Daolord of the
Second Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hisssss! Countless
golden serpents swarmed around him, and the nine novessence arts
rumbled as they transformed into dragons of energy which furiously
hammered down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A rippling curtain of
water appeared around the Ninedust Sectlord’s body, but in the end
his defenses were unable to hold. Still, much of the power of the
attacks had been weakened. “The power of the formation, combined
with this second-step Daolord’s secret arts, means that I’m at
best able to unleash a tenth of my true power.” The Ninedust
Sectlord felt like an ordinary man who was trapped in mud; every
single strike and movement was much slower than usual, as was the
power of his blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Ning’s
sword-light came straight towards him once more. Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! His longstaff struck out like a Flood Dragon as it swept
forwards, but Ning’s sword-light was formless and traceless, moving
without sound and springing towards him from every direction..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts truly
are unpredictable.” In the previous battle, the Ninedust Sectlord
had overwhelmingly dominated Ning, and so he hadn’t truly realized
how tough to deal with Ning’s sword-arts were. Now that his
personal power had been dramatically reduced, he came to understand
what a tough foe Ning truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues…
fighting in the Eastroad Sect’s base is disadvantageous to me.”
The Ninedust Sectlord let out a furious roar, and his aura instantly
expanded dramatically. The longstaff in his hands actually increased
in size still further, allowing him to instantly overwhelm Ning and
put Ning back on the defensive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the new sectlord
of the Ninedust Sect is as powerful as this, eh?” Ning only grew
even more excited. “Perfect. The stronger he is, the better it will
be for me. I just hope he isn’t too much for me to handle.” Ning
had been itching to find a chance to train his sword-arts, and he
needed this sort of terrifying pressure in order for him to gain the
insights he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sect had a
former sectlord who had been an extremely vile person. He had been
the one to establish the actual sect, and back then Daolord
Clevermind and the others had all been his retainers. Later on, the
old sectlord had perished and the new one had risen to power. The new
sectlord always wore a mask on his face and was a very mysterious
figure. Each time he put his power on display, he had shown to the
Brightshore Kingdom that he was on the same level of power as the
likes of Daolord Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck. OFF!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was putting more and more pressure on Ning,
continuing to advance while Ning was forced to retreat. Slowly,
however, the look in Ning’s eyes began to change. First, a hint of
puzzlement appeared. Then, a look of insight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did cultivators put
themselves in dangerous situations? Why did they walk the fine line
between life and death? It was all because they could only make
breakthroughs through epiphanies gained when under immense pressure.
If they focused all of their time and effort on training in
seclusion, it would be difficult for them to become truly
accomplished figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord’s
staff-arts truly were abstruse and profound. Although Ning trained in
the Omega Sword Dao, he was still just a Daolord of the First Step.
As a result, the Ninedust Sectlord’s ‘Dao’ completely
outstripped Ning’s in raw power, giving him an enormous amount of
pressure. Under this immense pressure, Ning began to make some
breakthroughs thanks to the accumulated experiences he had gained
while walking the Void Pathway for nearly a million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that is my Omega
Sword Dao… level two.” A hint of a smile was on Ning’s lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The
nine novessence arts had been dominating and awesome to begin with,
but they suddenly transformed to become even more abstruse and
profound than ever before. They had clearly become much more powerful
than just a short while ago, and were now as strong as the
restrictive spells protecting the Eastroad Sect. The Ninedust
Sectlord blanched when he saw this; moments ago he had been
dominating Ning, but now he had to focus all of his energy into
resisting the nine novessence arts and those little golden serpents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
twirled his longstaff, struggling to defend while dodging nonstop.
The shockwaves from this battle were causing the nearby palaces to
all fall apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can reach the
third level with my Omega Sword Dao, my nine novessence arts might be
able to reach Daolord Allgod’s level in power,” Ning mused to
himself. Based on his calculations pertaining to the power of his
Omega Sword Dao, when he was a Daolord of the Third Step his Omega
Sword Dao would be roughly on par with the Daos of the likes of
Palace Lord Dawnstar or Daolord Allgod. By then, when he infused his
Omega Sword Dao into his nine novessence arts they should be just as
powerful as they had been when Daolord Allgod had personally used
them to suppress and entrap Emperor Melobo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for right now? He
wasn’t able to suppress Emperor Melobo yet, but he was able to
force the Ninedust Sectlord to tread lightly, whereas in the past the
latter was able to defend against it without too much difficulty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust
Sectlord, eh? When I killed Kongsan, it was all thanks to the Hegemon
Dao-seal, not my own power. If I can slay the Ninedust Sectlord with
my own abilities… that would be much more interesting.” Ning
immediately retreated as he sent his nine novessence arts forward
along with those little golden serpents. At this point, he was able
to advance and retreat as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly retreated
tens of thousands of kilometers, then stood at an empty area and
watched from afar as the nine novessence arts and the little golden
snakes besiege the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, why have you retreated?” Daolord Thunderheat asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’ve gained
certain insights and wish to make my breakthrough,” Ning sent
mentally. “After I do so, the Ninedust Sectlord will no longer be a
problem.” Swoosh. A black flying vessel appeared, and Ning entered
it. With his nine novessence arts and his flying vessel guarding him,
he was ready to begin his breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, his
breakthrough would be a two-step process. He would first make a
breakthrough as a Ki Refiner, upgrading his Jindan chaos region, then
make a breakthrough with his divine body as well! He was on a
battlefield, after all. If he tried to breakthrough simultaneously in
both aspects, he wouldn’t even be able to fight back if he ended up
in serious trouble. It was best to be careful. To speed up the
process, Ning elected to simply use chaos jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had killed
Daolord Kongsan, he had acquired a good number of treasures. Other
treasures and curios aside, Ning had over two hundred million cubes
worth of chaos nectar and chaos jewels! The amount of chaos jewels
needed to break through to become a Daolord of the Second Step was
negligible for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree within
Ning’s Jindan chaos region began to grow.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_11___Breakthrough___The"></A>
Chapter 11 – Breakthrough – The Ninedust Sectlords Goal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every branch of the
titanic Dao-tree luxuriated with foliage and stretched skywards like
a dragon in flight. They had previously been 156,000 meters high, but
now they began to climb once more. The tree trunk grew thicker and
thicker, soon climbing to the awesome span of 252,000 meters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">252,000 meters was a
limit for Daolords of the Second Step. Ordinary Daolords, when they
made their cultivation breakthroughs to the second step, would
generally only reach at most a height of 210,000 metres. Only after
they slowly gained more insights and further perfected their Dao
would they reach 252,000 meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, however, was
different. His Omega Sword Dao truly was the omega; it would always
be at the apex of power for any level he was at, and going past that
would represent a fundamental, qualitative change! Similarly, there
were some Daolords of the Fourth Step who would need to train for
countless years before reaching the Verge, but some would be at the
Verge of the Daomerge as soon as they reached the fourth step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… it is
much harder for me to train in my Omega Sword Dao. It took forever
for me to go from being a Daolord of the First Step to being a
Daolord of the Second Step,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had reached
the second step long ago. As for Pillsaint, he had buried himself in
his study of alchemy and broken through in a very natural manner.
This was the case for most Daolords; moving from the first step to
the second step was very, very easy. There were no bottlenecks
involved for the vast majority of them… but Ning had technically
been trainng for over a million years of accelerated time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, by comparison
breaking through to the second step was fairly simple. Becoming a
Daolord of the Third Step will be a hundred times more difficult. As
for reaching the fourth step… that’ll be even tougher.” Ning
understood that the more difficult a Dao was, the harder it would be
for him to break through while training in it. Take Numerancy for
example! Even someone who was as incredibly talented in this dao as
Daolord Badlands was still just a Daolord of the Third Step! Ning’s
Omega Sword Dao was far more powerful than Badlands’ Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. As the Dao-tree
grew, the Jindan chaos region began to expand as well. Because Ning
was using chaos jewels to make his breakthrough, no commotion was
caused and no fluctuations in the surrounding primordial chaos could
be observed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s attention was
completely focused upon making the necessary breakthroughs, and he
spared just ab it of energy on maintaining his nine novessence arts
and having them attack the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Why have these
secret arts suddenly become so much more powerful?” The Ninedust
Sectlord spun the longstaff in his hands, his body constantly
flickering as he swept his weapon out in every direction to block the
endless sea of small golden snakes and the nine mighty novessence
arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
direction, over there. I can sense the whispers of fate growing
louder and louder.” On the surface, it looked like the Ninedust
Sectlord was able to fight back against the nine novessence arts and
the little golden snakes, but in reality he was ‘accidentally’
moving further and further in a certain direction while dodging. He’d
sometimes go left, sometimes go right, sometimes advance, sometimes
retreat… but on the whole, he was moving closer and closer to the
place which was calling out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s where my
destiny lies. I’ve worked so hard to follow the Emperor’s
guidance. I’ve taken over the Ninedust Sect and used it to explore
all of the surrounding territories… and now, I’ve finally
verified that my destiny lies within the Eastroad Sect. I’m going
to grasp it, no matter what.” While it looked like the Ninedust
Sectlord was being pressed quite hard, in reality everything was
still under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the formations
of the Eastroad Sect and the nine novessence arts were all extremely
powerful, they shared a common flaw; both were domain-type attacks.
There were simply too many of those little golden serpents, and they
had primarily been designed to entrap and encumber a foe, allowing
Daolord Eastroad himself to deliver the actual fatal blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning’s nine
novessence arts, they were also meant to be used as a domain-type
attack. Daolord Allgod had devised this technique to entrap Emperor
Melobo! They were meant to serve as a domain for trapping and
surrounding an enemy. They would be able to easily smash through
weaker Daolords, but only have a restrictive effect on a truly
powerful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. The
Ninedust Sectlord continued to silently advance at a glacial pace,
afraid of attracting the attention of Daolord Thunderheat or Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
revealed a look of delight within his black flying vessel. He had
finally made his breakthrough. His aura was now markedly stronger
than before, and his divine power and Immortal energy had both
reached a fundamentally higher level than they had before. Ning
quickly began to enhance the six Northbow swords on his back, guiding
them in improving their quintessence cores of Sword Dao. This was
what was good about Lifeblood weapons; you could continuously perfect
and upgrade their quintessence cores, allowing them to grow alongside
you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… the
requirements for the creation of a Lifeblood weapon were quite
stringent. None of the treasures left behind by Daolord Kongsan were
suitable for conversion into a Lifeblood weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next, time for me to
upgrade my azureflower mist energy.” Ning’s combat prowess was
primarily thanks to the azureflower mist energy. He rapidly poured
his divine power and his Immortal energy into the azureflower region,
replenishing both with his chaos jewels as necessary. However, his
azureflower region was now far larger than before, and so more time
was needed to ‘fill it up’ with azureflower mist energy than had
been needed for Ning to upgrade his divine body and his Jindan chaos
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that it
is within a hundred kilometers of me.” A hint of delight flashed
through the Ninedust Sectlord’s eyes. “No need to delay any
further. Let’s do this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly struck out with the longstaff in his hands, sweeping aside
the domain attacks as though he was parting the waters with them,
then charged at full speed towards a certain direction. To someone
like him, a hundred meters was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! He had reached a
courtyard which was protected by a restrictive barrier. The Ninedust
Sectlord’s aura once more burst forth; clearly, he was going
all-out now. The staff in his hands struck out, piercing straight
through the formation and into the courtyard. It struck against a
decorative ‘mountain’ in the courtyard which had the carving of a
stone door atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is! So it
was a treasure of the ancestors.” The Ninedust Sectlord didn’t
hesitate at all; by now, the call from the statue was so strong that
it made his heart tremble. He immediately charged over, pressing his
hand against the stone door. Whoosh! The stone door immediately swung
open, revealing the passageway within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The Ninedust
Sectlord immediately dove into the passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Thunderheat was far off in the distance, controlling the formations
which protected the base. His face turned grim as soon the Ninedust
Sectlord suddenly charged towards the courtyard which held the Void
Pathway hidden within it. When the Ninedust Sectlord broke through
the formation and charged into the Void Pathway without hesitating,
Daolord Thunderheat’s face turned bone-white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknoth!” Unable to stop the Ninedust Sectlord, Daolord
Thunderheat had no choice but to call out to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On it.” Ning had
no time to accumulate any more azureflower mist energy. He only had
three drops of it inside his body, but he could sense that something
was wrong. The decorative ‘mountain’ hiding the Void Pathway
truly was an ordinary object with no aura at all, but the Ninedust
Sectlord had actually charged straight towards it as though he knew
the secrets which lay hidden inside it… then entered the Void
Pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Ning had
his nine novessence arts, he had been unable to stop the man. “I’ll
go deal with him.” Ning immediately charged forwards, arriving in
front of the artificial mountain with a whoosh. He then dove into the
Void Pathway. Although it had taken him quite some effort to build up
those three drops of azureflower mist energy, they were used up
fairly slowly during battle and so three drops probably would be
enough. Ning had been planning to build up more, but who would’ve
thought that the Ninedust Sectlord would suddenly dive into the Void
Pathway? Even in the Eastroad Sect, the secrets of the Void Pathway
were only known to Daolord-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was in
hot pursuit of the Ninedust Sectlord, he continued to build up more
of that azureflower mist energy, hoping to store as much as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Void
Pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the Ninedust
Sectlord enterd this place, he immediately saw that pathway as well
as the thirty thousand soldiers who stood in two lines on each side
of it. Their ancient armors, their solemn auras, and that carving of
a throne off in the distance… it all caused the Ninedust Sectlord
to quiver in excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s one of the
treasures of the ancestors! Of the ancestors! I never thought that I,
Redwater, would actually have a chance to come to a place set up by
the ancestors. All those years of hard work were worth it, completely
worth it! Haha…” The Ninedust Sectlord put away his mask,
revealing a cold, grim-looking male face. This face was currently
covered with excitement as he carefully reached out with his senses
to scan this place’s aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What secrets does
this ancestral site hold within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord’s
gaze swiftly turned to that distant golden throne, because it was the
throne which was issuing the strongest karmic call to him. “I’ll
head there first to take a look.” Longstaff in hand, the Ninedust
Sectlord charged straight towards the golden throne.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! As soon as he
stepped onto the golden pathway, an enormous globe of light suddenly
appeared in the void above it. The golden globe of light shot out two
streaks of light into two of the nearby armored soldiers, causing
them to immediately charge towards the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The
Ninedust Sectlord didn’t even pause as he struck out with his
longstaff, sending both of the soldiers flying far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! The golden globe of light shot down more and more rays of
golden light, causing a continuous stream of soldiers to charge
towards the Ninedust Sectlord. However, the sectlord continued to
advance at high speed, smashing through all of his opposition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Right at this
moment, another figure appeared within the Void Pathway as well. It
was a white-robed youth who bore black swords on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust Sectlord!”
Ning let out a furious roar, causing all nine of his novessence arts
to instantly surge outwards and attempt to constrict the Ninedust
Sectlord. They shot out like Flood Dragons, moving with incredible
speed and power as they almost instantly caught up to the sectlord,
then coiled around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to stop me?
I’m at the very end of a long journey. No one will stop me!” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s hair flew in the air as azure light flashed
within his eyes. It seemed as though he had used some sort of secret
art, as he was now even stronger than he had been when battling Ning
earlier. Layers of water curtains appeared around him as well,
weakening the effects of the nine novessence arts and allowing him to
endure all the blows aimed at him as he continued his headlong
charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s gone
berserk.” Ning understood this right away, and so he flew forwards
at high speed as well. As for the golden globe of light, it shot out
more rays of golden light, causing more and more soldiers to appear
in front of Ning and block his path as well.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 – Ancestor! Ancestor!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ji Ning
immediately activated his [Three Heads, Six Arms]. Six Northbow
swords in hands, he swept through the armored soldiers just as
quickly as the Ninedust Sectlord had. The soldiers were completely
incapable of stopping him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
and Ning advanced in succession at high speed through the pathway. By
comparison, Ning was actually a bit faster as the Ninedust Sectlord
was being slowed down by the nine novessence arts. As Ning chased
after the sectlord, he suddenly sent a mental shout, “Sectlord, I
imagine the real reason you came to the Eastroad Sect was to enter
this pathway!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a cold snort from up ahead as he continued
to defeat the soldiers in his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been puzzled,
all this time, as to why you are doing this. If you just wanted to
take over the Eastroad Territory, there was no need for you to attack
the Eastroad Sect itself. It takes up almost no space, after all.”
Ning sent mentally, “And there’s no way anyone can notice
anything unusual about this pathway from outside… but you breached
the formation protecting the area around it, then headed straight for
it. You certainly know some of the secrets behind it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
completely ignored Ning, but Ning was starting to understand more and
more. Ning himself had only discovered this pathway after Daolord
Thunderheat had guided him to it; when he had first seen the
decorative ‘mountain’, he hadn’t noticed anything special about
it at all. Both Daolord Thunderheat and Ning were extremely puzzled
by how the Ninedust Sectlord had flown straight towards the mountain,
as though he already knew everything about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to stop me.” The Ninedust Sectlord finally spoke, his voice icy
cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been scheming
this ever since Daolord Eastroad had perished. He had released word
of Daolord Eastroad’s death, then ambushed and slain Daolord
Overgold! He had even sent the Ninedust Shrine to stand guard outside
the Eastroad Everworld, and had been keeping a quiet watch on it like
a hungry wolf staring at its prey. His goal had been to cause terror
and panic, hoping to force the Eastroad Sect to voluntarily flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Eastroad Sect
really had fled, things would be simple. Upon fleeing, the formations
within the sect would have to be withdrawn… and he would be able to
follow that silent call of fate as it moved away. He would
immediately attack and wipe out the fleeing Eastroad Sect! But of
course, if that call of fate remained immobile, he would’ve spared
the Eastroad Sect and instead headed straight to the source of the
call.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, his true
goal was the destiny which awaited him! The reason why he hadn’t
been willing to fight head-on was because he was afraid that
Patriarch Eastroad might’ve left behind some sort of deadly spell
or technique for his heirs. In truth, his fears were well-founded;
Daolord Thunderheat did indeed have a treasure capable of unleashing
a deadly attack which was more powerful than the Dao-seals bestowed
by Skyaxe and Soleman. The reason why Patriarch Eastroad had dared to
go off adventuring was because he had left behind an incredibly
powerful protective treasure in Thunderheat’s hands to protect his
home. However, this was a single-use item; since Ning had offered to
help out, Daolord Thunderheat naturally forebore from using it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was very careful
this entire time; I wanted to make sure that I didn’t drive the
Eastroad Sect into a state of true desperation. Although I’m fairly
certain I would be able to survive even their most frenzied attacks,
I still probably would’ve been forced to pay a heavy price.” The
Ninedust Sectlord felt quite smug. “Now, I’ve reached this
ancestral site without suffering any injuries at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, what?!” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s face suddenly turned pale. He glanced
backwards, only to see Ji Ning drawing closer and closer to him. “How
could he be moving even faster than me?!” The Ninedust Sectlord was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pathway had a
total of thirty thousand soldiers, while the Ninedust Sectlord had
already charged past twenty-six thousand of them. By now, every
single soldier was vastly stronger than Patriarch Clearwind in his
normal state. While the Ninedust Sectlord was still able to advance
fairly quickly, he felt certain that the white-robed Daolord’s
speed would begin to decline as the more powerful soldiers began to
appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This white-robed
Daolord is much weaker than me. How is it that he’s moving even
faster?” The Ninedust Sectlord couldn’t believe this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
continued to advance at high speed. Soon, he passed the twenty-six
thousand soldier mark as well. He had spent more than ten thousand
years in the Void Pathway, but he had never defeated this many
warriors before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust Sectlord,
was all this for the sake of that golden throne?” Ning sent
mentally. He wanted to learn some of the secrets regarding the Void
Pathway from watching the Ninedust Sectlord, as Ning himself hadn’t
been able to discern much about it despite having spent so many years
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord,
however, seemed to ignore Ning’s question as he continued to
battle, a cold smile on his face. “It seems you’ve made a
breakthrough? No wonder your secret arts have improved so
substantially.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all thanks to
you. Our last battle allowed me to finally understand what was
missing, and I’ve taken yet another step.” Ning continued to
smash through all opposition with overwhelming fierceness in his
three-headed, six-armed form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really did make a
breakthrough.” The Ninedust Sectlord couldn’t help but secretly
feel regret. “He was already on par with Clevermind when he was a
Daolord of the Second Step. That means that he should now be on par
with me! And those damnable secret arts of his are causing me trouble
at every turn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
clenched his teeth, continuing his headlong charge. His longstaff
swept out with draconic might, causing a series of booms as it
smashed and blasted its way through the various enemy soldiers.
Unfortunately, Ning continued to move faster than him and was still
closing the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty-eight thousand
soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty-nine thousand
soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were now
extremely close to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. If this
continues, he’s going to catch up to me. I have no choice but to
use that forbidden art yet again. Ugh!” The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly let out a deep growl. His aura once more skyrocketed as an
awesome burst of energy manifested around him. His aura was now
stronger than even Daolord Kongsan’s aura had been. Auras were
generally linked to divine power and Immortal energy; clearly, the
Ninedust Sectlord’s divine body was far stronger than the bodies of
most Daolords of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first time he had
used this forbidden art had been when he had broken through the
barriers protecting the courtyard which held the entrance into the
Void Pathway. Now, he did so again, and he grew noticeably more
powerful as he strove to pull away from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning was rather surprised by this. “The Ninedust Sectlord really
does have quite a few tricks up his sleeves. Still… it won’t be
of any use. He’s not escaping me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty-nine thousand,
five hundred… twenty-nine thousand, six hundred…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers were
growing more and more powerful, and both Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord were starting to slow down and the distance between the two
continued to shrink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last two.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a bellow as he charged against the final
two soldiers. The two golden-armored soldiers opened their glowing
golden eyes as they stared at the Ninedust Sectlord. BOOM! BOOM! They
charged straight towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
started to fight against the two final soldiers. He was actually
unable to defeat them right away. “Why are these soldiers this
powerful?!” The Ninedust Sectlord didn’t know that even Patriarch
Eastroad had been forced to go all-out before just barely eeking out
a victory. Now that the Ninedust Sectlord was being hampered by
Ning’s nine novessence arts, it would be quite difficult for him to
defeat these two final soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, you won’t
be able to escape.” Boom! Boom! Two soldiers behind him were
blasted aside as a white-robed figure charged straight for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s face was ashen. He had been forced to use his
forbidden art and as a result had managed to somehow keep himself
ahead of the freakishly strong white-robed Daolord, but the strength
of the two final soldiers had given his enemy the chance to catch up
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” The
Ninedust Sectlord lashed out with his longstaff, striking out towards
the attacking Ning in an almost whip-like blow. Thanks to his usage
of that forbidden art, he was still able to unleash roughly 80% of
his full power despite the encumberance of the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! When the staff
intersected with Ning’s sword-light, it was as though it had become
trapped within the gravity well of a black hole and saw all of its
strength pushed off to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omega Sword Dao –
Soleheart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape!” Ning charged forwards, an array of countless streams of
sword-light slashing towards the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Due to Ning’s
assault, the Ninedust Sectlord revealed a flaw in his defenses,
resulting in one of the two soldiers landing an attack on him. The
Ninedust Sectlord was actually forced to stumble five steps
backwards. He was enraged to the point of lunacy, and he charged
forwards again with teeth gritted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord battled against each other while also fending off the
attacks of those two soldiers. Thankfully, the two soldiers treated
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord ‘equally’, launching attacks
against both! This was why the battle had entered a stalemate for
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you must
have used some sort of forbidden art,” Ning sent mentally. “Let’s
see how long you can hold it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you didn’t have
your own secret arts, you wouldn’t be a match for me.” The
Ninedust Sectlord was furious. Even after having used his forbidden
art, he was still in rather dire straits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however,
understood that there was a limit to how strong the nine novessence
arts would be. He had already mastered them as a Daolord of the First
Step, and back then they vastly surpassed Ning’s close-combat
abilities! Although he could continue to strengthen them as his Omega
Sword Dao improved, his close-combat abilities would improve far more
rapidly. He was already on par with the Ninedust Sectlord in close
combat, which meant that those abilities were already superior to
those nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, all secret
arts were a form of external strength! If you focused too much on
secret arts and not enough on your Dao, there would be a limit to how
much you could improve. Still, it was true that the influence of the
nine novessence arts ensured that Ning was in an advantageous
position in this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two soldiers who
had been furiously assaulting Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord suddenly
retreated at the same instant, voluntarily stepping back. Both Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord were stunned by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are falling
back?” The Ninedust Sectlord instantly realized what was happening.
A look of wild delight on his face, he charged straight towards the
golden throne at the very end of the pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” When Ning
saw the Ninedust Sectlord furiously charge towards that golden
throne, he ignored all else and the same thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! The two
figures arrived next to the golden throne at virtually the same
instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weng…ba…hu…jiu…”
Suddenly, an incredibly ancient and distant voice emanated from the
golden globe of light. It seemed to come from the beginning of time
itself, and it carried an aura of mystery and almighty power. It
almost sounded like the mumbling of an ancient and powerful figure,
and it caused the entire region to begin to shake. Every single part
of the void around the pathway began to glow with countless strange
runes, and layers of golden rippling light began to appear around the
golden throne as well which swept Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord into
their embrace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ancestors! The
ancestors!” The Ninedust Sectlord was unspeakably excited when he
heard this voice. As for Ning, he was completely puzzled. He
continued to keep his six Northbow swords at the ready, prepared for
any danger.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every part of this
golden region was filled with those strange runes, with the golden
throne being at the center of it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ji Ning frowned. “Previously, Daolord Thunderheat told me that if
you defeat all the soldiers and reach the golden throne, you would
gain a legacy… but this doesn’t look like the mere transmission
of a legacy. Was Daolord Eastroad lying to Daolord Thunderheat? Or
was he lying to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
the Ninedust Sectlord knows something. Not only is he not worried, he
actually looks excited.” Ning glanced at the nearby Ninedust
Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
was indeed excited after having heard that ancient, distant voice
ring out from the golden globe of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, what is
going on exactly?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Ninedust Sectlord glanced sideways at Ning, then smiled coldly. “Do
you really think I’ll tell you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you won’t, then
you can forget about achieving whatever goals you have here.” As
soon as Ning said these words, he sent a surge of sword-light towards
the Ninedust Sectlord, the sword-light seemingly filled with the
power to destroy all Daos that stood in its path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop, stop!” The
Ninedust Sectlord called out frantically. The white-robed Daolord in
front of him was extremely powerful, on the same level as him; if he
wanted to cause trouble, something bad really might happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak!” Ning
barked. “What secrets does this Void Pathway hold?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either,” the Ninedust Sectlord said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you screwing
around with me?” Ning was about to continue his attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really don’t
know!” The Ninedust Sectlord hurriedly dodged, not daring to fight
back for fear that the shockwaves from their battle would cause a
disaster to unfold. “I’m not lying to you. I really don’t
know!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning was
attacking and the Ninedust Sectlord was dodging…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ringed curtains of
golden light emanating from the golden throne suddenly retracted,
like the petals of a flower suddenly be drawn back into the pistil.
Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of golden
light suddenly tore through spacetime. Whoosh! Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord had both been covered by that curtain of golden light, and
they instantly disappeared without a trace, leaving only the golden
throne behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No other living beings
remained within the Void Pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more power
emanated from that golden globe, bathing the entire golden region in
a layer of golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A golden ripple
of power suddenly spread out from one of the decorative ‘mountains’
within the Eastroad Sect. Moments later, it completely vanished
without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Thunderheat had been watching carefully from a safe distance. When he
saw this, his face instantly turned pale. He appeared within that
courtyard in a flash. “Where’s the Void Pathway? Where’d it go?
Why did it suddenly vanish?! His godsense had been infused into the
formation protecting the sect, and so was able to cover and scour
every inch of the region. And yet, he was no longer able to find that
decorative mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
and the Ninedust Sectlord have both vanished as well?” Daolord
Thunderheat was starting to panic. “I always felt certain that the
Void Pathway was holding certain mysteries. Those thirty thousand
soldiers were unreasonably powerful, especially the final two; those
two were on par with Patriarch Eastroad himself. I imagine that when
Daolord Darknorth and the Ninedust Sectlord battled within the Void
Pathway, they must have activated some of its secrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well… now what
should I do? Daolord Darknorth suddenly vanished. If he died, then…”
Daolord Thunderheat felt rather guilty, because he did have a trump
card which he hadn’t used yet. Still, he couldn’t be blamed for
holding it back; the Eastroad Sect would need to conserve all the
resources it had if it wanted to survive. It looked as though Daolord
Darknorth was strong enough to hold back the Ninedust Sectlord;
Thunderheat naturally hadn’t been willing to use up his one and
only trump card.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
asked for nothing; he whole-heartedly wished to help my Eastroad
Sect. And now, his whereabouts are unknown.” Daolord Thunderheat
had a complex look on his face as he murmured softly, “I promise
the Eastroad Sect will never forget your benevolence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
disappearance of the Void Pathway? Daolord Thunderheat felt a bit of
regret, but he didn’t care all that much. For it to be able to
vanish despite local spacetime being completely distorted thanks to
the Eastroad Sect’s formations meant that it was a treasure that
was beyond the Eastroad Sect’s ability to control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it stayed here, it
would only cause more trouble in the future. It was a disaster
waiting to happen, not a blessing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Eastroad
Sect. The Ninedust Shrine continued to hover there in the empty
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Ninedust
Shrine. Daolord Graceful had already fled all the way back into the
shrine. Both he and Daolord Clevermind were standing in front of its
gates, staring towards the distant Eastroad Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord
Clevermind’s face suddenly paled. “Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Daolord Graceful immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can no longer
sense the Sectlord’s presence.” Daolord Clevermind said
frantically, “The Sectlord has one of my talismans on him; I can
sense him from several territories away. But now, I can no longer
sense his presence at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Graceful’s face paled as well. Daolord Clevermind’s position
within the Ninedust Sect was second only to the sectlord’s himself,
which was why he was on very good terms with the sectlord. Each had
given talismans to the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sectlord should
still be be alive, but I can no longer sense him.” Daolord
Clevermind said frantically, “The Sectlord is probably in a very,
very distant place. Alternately, he might be trapped in a dangerous
place which prevents any information being transmitted outwards.
However, a site capable of blocking off my senses would definitely be
an incredibly dangerous place. There shouldn’t be any such place
within the Eastroad Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
the Eastroad Sect holds certain mysteries within it,” Daolord
Graceful said softly. “That white-robed Daolord was incredibly
strong. Now, even our Sectlord is in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daolord
Clevermind turned to stare at the Eastroad Sect with great
trepidation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep waiting
here for the Sectlord to return,” Daolord Graceful said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the Ninedust
Sect permanently stationed itself outside the Eastroad Sect. They
would wait for their sectlord’s return… but even after waiting
more than a hundred thousand years, their sectlord still did not
return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord were both rather nervous as the streak of golden light
grabbed both of them and sent them hurtling through spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where in the world
are we going?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a
spacetime teleportation last for this long?” Ning kept his [Three
Heads, Six Arms] divine ability active, and he continued to warily
wield all six Northbow swords in his hands. It was extremely
difficult to use spacetime teleportation across such a great
distance. Even spacetime transfer arrays were all fairly close to
each other, allowing the various formations to interlink and send
people from one territory to another. The spacetime tunnels created
by the almighty Brightshore Hegemon and the Paragon of Pills covered
a much greater distance, but this golden spacetime tunnel? Based on
Ning’s perception regarding spacetime, they should be hurtling
towards an incredibly distant place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, do you
really have no idea where we are being sent to?” Ning glanced at
the nearby Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
glanced at Ning, then let out a cold snort. “No idea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t doubt
this at all, because he could sense how nervous the Ninedust Sectlord
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two just stood
there calmly, neither daring to move. If they got into a fight and
disturbed the flows of spacetime around them, who knew where they
would end up? They might disappear into the endless Great Dark, where
they could fly for thousands of chaos cycles without seeing a single
other living being. That would be horrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The changing flows of
spacetime around them suddenly came to a halt, allowing them to
vaguely make out what was hidden outside the field of golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve arrived.”
Both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord were even more cautious now. The
golden light slowly dissipated, allowing them to clearly see an
enormous stone passageway in front of them. A number of boulders were
levitating within the stone passageway, which was brimming with
blazing flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Both Ning and
the Ninedust Sectlord stood there in midair. A curtain of water
emerged from the Ninedust Sectlord’s body, blocking off the flames.
As for Ning, the nine novessence arts appeared and swirled around
him, defending him from the fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such powerful fire.
I imagine these flames would roast Daolords of the Third Step to
death.” Ning was rather amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What type of fire is
this?” The Ninedust Sectlord was puzzled as well. He had seen many
things, but still had no idea what these flames were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And those boulders?”
Both of them turned their attention towards the levitating boulders.
These flames were capable of killing Daolords of the Third Step, but
weren’t able to damage these boulders at all. Those boulders were
definitely extraordinary items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those things have to
be treasures.” Both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord immediately
charged forwards. Ning stabbed out with his sword, seeking to carve
out a large boulder from the crooked, curved ‘walls’ of the stone
corridor. As for the Ninedust Sectlord, he swung his longstaff and
delivered a fierce below to the stone walls of the passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two explosions rang out
against the stone walls, which rumbled as invisible ripples spread
out across its surface. BOOM! A shockwave burst out and struck Ning,
knocking him flying backwards. A second shockwave was applied to the
Ninedust Sectlord, whose body seemed to shudder and briefly transform
into a flowing stream of water as he flew backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such incredible
power. The shockwave generated by me stabbing at the sword seemed to
be several times stronger than my blow.” Ning rose into the air
once more, a nervous feeling in his heart. “And it seems as though
all of the stones within this stone passageway are part of one
entity.” When he had stabbed out with his sword, he felt as though
the entire stone wall had joined together to unleash a surge of
counter-force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Ninedust Sectlord rose into the air as well. For a moment, his body
had transformed into a human-shaped pool of water, but he now
returned to his normal appearance as he glanced at the distant Ning.
“The kid actually managed to endure that counter-force with such
ease? It seems as though he has a protective divine ability that is
just as tough as mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord both had rather blazing looks in their eyes. Both were
amongst the ranks of the most talented of Daolords, on the same level
as Kongsan… and yet, they weren’t even able to harvest any rocks
from this stone wall. This meant the stone here was definitely quite
extraordinary… and the more marvelous an item was, the more
valuable it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord immediately charged towards the floating boulders
and bits of stone, waving their hands and collecting as much as they
could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Although it was quite difficult to collect each of those rocks as
they were all incredibly heavy, in the end it was still possible to
store them within an estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master! I
can no longer sense my clone!” The servant within Ning’s
estate-world who was responsible for maintaining contact with the
Brightshore Kingdom suddenly sent a frantic mental message to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning,
however, was quite calm. He had sensed long ago that this was an
extraodinary place; in truth, as soon as the teleportation had begun
he almost instantly lost contact with both his Primaltwin and his
avatar. The last time something like this had happened, he had gone
into the alternate universe!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures could be
seen darting through the blazing flames within that stone corridor,
collecting the various stones that were hanging there in the air. A
short while later, Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord had completely
collected all of the levitating stones as far as they could see.
After collecting the final pieces, they turned to stare at each other
with vigilance in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our battle has
resulted in both of us being trapped in this unknown region. It can
be said that the ties of karma bind us together… but I don’t even
know your Daoist title,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.”
Ning revealed a smile. “Given our current situation, there’s no
need to continue hiding things from each other. I trust you know much
more about this place than I do, Lord of the Ninedust Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
shook his head. “I really know nothing about this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning raised
an eyebrow. “Well, it truly is an odd place.” Ning scanned his
surroundings as he spoke. “These flames… I can’t even tell what
type of flames they are. I can’t recognize the stone here either.
Even my godsense and my heartforce are constrained, preventing me
from exploring any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite.” The
Ninedust Sectlord had a solemn look on his face as well as he scanned
the area, a restless feeling in his heart. Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A fiery-armored
figure suddenly flew out of a turn in the tunnel ahead of them. This
humanoid figure’s entire body was brimming with flames, and his
hair was a blazing red color as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord simultaneously turned to look at the blazing
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you truly
are daring, to have infiltrated your way to this place without anyone
noticing.” The humanoid figure spoke in a cold, piercing voice.
“For me to end up stumbling into you two… it seems my luck today
is quite decent. Prepare to die.” After speaking, the blazing
figure transformed into a streak of blazing light that seemed to draw
in the flames which filled the entire stone passageway, forming a
fiery halo of energy around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looks of puzzlement
appeared on the faces of both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” The
Ninedust Sectlord barked, “We have no idea who you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you mistaken us
for someone else?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your lies won’t
save you.” The flaming figure let out a furious shout, manifesting
a scimitar in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s how you
wish to behave, go ahead and die.” An angered look flashed through
the Ninedust Sectlord’s icy, sinister face. He swung out his
longstaff, seeming to manifest an endless ocean of water which
carried the roaring song of the sea with it, then struck out against
the blazing figure with a boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the blazing
figure used his scimitar to defend, he was blown backwards and
smashed against the stone walls of the passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t die?”
The Ninedust Sectlord was rather surprised. Although he hadn’t
struck out with full force, most Daolords of the Fourth Step would’ve
perished from that blow. Who would’ve thought that this flaming
humanoid would actually have survived?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you are
fairly strong.” The fiery figure growled, “Good. The stronger you
are, the better. After I kill you, it’ll feel even better when I
feast on your corpses. Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Feast on me?” The
Ninedust Sectlord said furiously, “Die, you imbecile.” This time,
he used his staff to strike out with full force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The longstaff
caused cracks in space to appear around it as it struck forwards, the
power of the blow causing the entire area around them to shake and
tremble. This blow was not just fast and savage, it also seemed to
carry the cadence of the waves of the ocean, moving sometimes fast
and sometimes slow. The flaming creature sought to defend against
this attack, but its scimitar wasn’t even able to touch the
longstaff. The head of the longstaff smashed directly against the
fiery creature’s chest, and it was like the heavens themselves had
crashed down upon him. The flaming creature instantly let out a
frenzied scream… and with a boom, the creature’s body instantly
blew apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imbecile.” The
Ninedust Sectlord showed no mercy at all, striking a second time with
his longstaff with the intention of completely annihilating its
shattered body. Whoosh! The longstaff swept out, completely smashing
apart the shattered remnants of the creature’s body and dispersing
it into flames once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill me? You want to
kill me?! You aren’t able to kill me!!!” A furious voice rang out
as a large amount of the flames within the stone corridor gathered
together and almost instantly reformed into the flaming humanoid. He
still wore that armor around him, and his scimitar was completely
undamaged as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning had
simply been observing with interest, but now his face began to turn
pale. “He didn’t die? His body was completely shattered, but he
still didn’t die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For normal cultivators,
once their bodies were completely destroyed they would lose their
lives. Only unique types of cultivation could result in ‘unkillable
forms’, such as the virtually indestructible ‘darkness incarnate’
form of Daolord Kongsan. Palace Lord Dawnstar was far more powerful
than Kongsan; Kongsan was just barely comparable to ordinary Eternal
Emperors, while Palace Lord Dawnstar was able to kill them with ease.
The difference in power between the two was obvious… and yet, due
to having an ‘unkillable form’, Kongsan could be ground into dust
but then transform into darkness incarnate, ensuring that he didn’t
die! Very few people had techniques like this, and it was this
technique which made Kongsan so famous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An unkillable form?”
The Ninedust Sectlord had a look of shock on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just an
unkillable form; he’s also able to harvest the flames floating
around in this region.” Ning frowned. “His aura didn’t weaken
in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha! The two of
you are dead meat.” The flaming creature once more charged towards
them, an angry howl escaping his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give it a
try,” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You go!”
The Ninedust Sectlord wasn’t certain in his own chances to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded just a
single sword, raising it up high with all six arms clutching it by
the hilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DESTROY!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire region began
to tremble and shake. It was like a volcano was building up its
power, preparing for a final explosion. Ning’s sword-light suddenly
slashed through the air, chopping down furiously upon the flaming
creature’s form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! This was Ning’s
most savage and most dominating strike. It caused the creature’s
entire body to shudder, then completely break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine novessence
arts, go!” With but a thought, Ning sent nine dragons of energy
flying out of his body. Rumbling, they transformed into a chaotic
Yin-Yang Sword Domain and furiously ground away at the scattered bits
of the flaming creature’s body. The creature’s body quickly
dissipated into flames, but the nine novessence arts completely
covered the entire area with their domain, continuously extinquishing
the flames. After a very long period of time, the mysterious flames
in the area were finally and completely extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead.” Ning
dispelled his nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That took forever.”
The Ninedust Sectlord nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a spark
appeared in the air in front of them. The spark quickly grew in size,
transforming into a towering conflagration that then once more
coalesced into that blazing, flame-covered humanoid figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Even after
being completely annihilated, it can rise anew from the void?” The
Ninedust Sectlord could hardly believe it. “B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not
possible. I had already completely extinguished it, leaving behind
not even so much as a trace of its aura. How could it be born anew?”
Ning couldn’t believe it either. “This ‘unkillable form’ it
has is terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t able to
kill me! You aren’t able to kill me!” The flaming creature let
out a low growl. “Come out! All of you, come out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the flaming creature
roared, a strange ripple of power quickly spread out. Just one second
later, two more flaming creatures came flying out from behind the
turn of the stone corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
faces of the two cultivators turned grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two creatures. Three
creatures. Four creatures… one flaming creature after another began
to fly out from behind the turn of the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just there.
There’s more coming from this side as well.” The Ninedust
Sectlord turned to look at the other side of the corridor. Flaming,
humanoid creatures were flooding in from both ends of the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave,
immediately!” Ning roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” The
Ninedust Sectlord didn’t dare to hesitate either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eat them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of twelve of
flaming humanoids had already appeared at the two ends of the
corridor, and their numbers were only growing. They began to launch a
furious charge towards the two cultivators, who chose one direction
and began to fight their way that way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning had
developed the second level of his Omega Sword Dao, his speed had
increased from ten times the speed of light to thirty times the speed
of light. As for the Ninedust Sectlord, he was a bit faster than
Ning. The two quickly beat aside the attacking creatures as they fled
for their lives, not daring to tarry whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attack! Attack! Attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flaming creatures
were completely unkillable; even if you wiped them out, they would be
reborn out of thin air. Their ability to draw from the omnipresent
flames of this place gave them almost limitless amounts of strength.
No one would be able to beat them in a battle of attrition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew the ancestral
lands wouldn’t be so easily traversed. Shit, shit, shit!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was starting to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s just too
many of them. Why are these flaming creatures everywhere?” Ning was
worried as well. The two of them had been fleeing for a full hour by
now, and they had thrown off many different packs of the creatures
while scurrying through the various stone passageways… and yet,
every single stone passageway seemed to contain these creatures, and
all of them were filled with the desire to kill the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in strength amongst the flaming creatures, with some being very close
to Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us need
to work together,” the Ninedust Sectlord sent mentally. “We can’t
keep such a wary watch on each other; we’ll only have a shot if we
truly work together as one. Otherwise, both of us will probably die
here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I concur. Let’s
swear a lifeblood oath,” Ning immediately agreed.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone passageways
branched out like a spiderweb’s web, with some being merely a few
hundred kilometers wide and others being tens of thousands of
kilometers wide. The widest were as much as a million kilometers
wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were in one of the
widest stone passageways right now. Flames were blazing everywhere,
and there were many of those flaming creatures living in this area.
Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord were able to sense from afar that
these creatures would pose a lethal danger to them. They didn’t
even dare to move close to them, instead choosing to fly into a more
narrower passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying black vessel
was advancing at high speed through the air, throwing behind the
fiery creatures behind them. Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord stood at
the very prow of the ship, and neither of them dared to relax at all
as they vigilantly scanned the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re coming.”
The Ninedust Sectlord gripped his longstaff, readying himself for the
assault. As for Ning, he was in his three-headed, six-armed form and
wielded all six Northbow swords in his hands. The two stood
shoulder-to-shoulder, staring towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly ten million
kilometers up ahead, more than six flaming creatures were waiting for
them at the turn of the stone passageway. Their numbers were
continuing to grow. Clearly, these flaming creatures had some method
of communicating to each other, and they knew that if they didn’t
gather in sufficient numbers there would be no way for them to stop
these two invaders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were ten
million kilometers away, the flying black vessel moved at a hundred
times the speed of light and so passed through that distance in an
instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freeze.” Ning’s
nine novessence arts were already activated, and nine enormous
dragons of power were surging through the area around him. They
transformed into a domain of sword-intent, suppressing and binding
the flaming creatures around them. It must be understood that these
flaming creatures were extremely tough; the Ninedust Sectlord had
been unable to shatter the first one with a half-power blow, and
Ning’s nine novessence arts were similarly unable to wipe them out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the nine
novessence arts definitely caused the flaming creatures to slow down
substantially.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The Ninedust
Sectlord let out a low growl as he swept out from left to right with
his longstaff, striking with the force of a thunderbolt. Boom! Boom!
Boom! One flaming creature after another was blown up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Silently and soundless, six of the flaming creatures were chopped
through in quick succession as the tips of Ning’s Northbow swords
were suddenly revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omega Sword Dao –
Shadowless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, flee
immediately! We have to escape this stone passageway as soon as we
can,” the Ninedust Sectlord sent mentally. “We can’t afford to
waste any more time here. We’ll be in serious trouble if we do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
agreed with his assessment. After so many battles, they both knew
some of the habits these flaming creatures had. They generally kept
to the specific passageway they were in, and they had a special way
of communicating with each other within the passageway! If they spent
too much time in any specific passageway, more and more of the
creatures would accumulate until finally, a veritable army of them
would be on the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most disastrous
battle they had been in involved more than three hundred of the
flaming creatures surrounding and attacking them, three of which were
nearly as powerful as the two of them. Ning had been forced to rely
on the power of his nine novessence arts and the perfection of his
Omega Sword Dao to just barely fend them off. The Ninedust Sectlord’s
staff-arts weren’t as defensively powerful as Ning’s sword-arts,
and so he had to rely on his forbidden technique instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had escaped by
the skin of their teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them grew
increasingly crafty as time went on. They’d rely on Ning’s
Shadowless evasion technique to avoid discovery for as long as
possible, and they’d end or escape any battles they found
themselves trapped in immediately, not wasting any time. And yet,
they would still occasionally run into some trouble. These flaming
creatures truly seemed to be immortal; no matter how hard they hit
the creatures, they just wouldn’t die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a tunnel
over there. Hide inside it.” They flew into a new, untouched stone
passageway via the flying vessel and Ning’s Shadowless evasion
technique, then quickly dove into a cave opening on the stone walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can rest here for
a short while.” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord both relaxed
slightly. They had been lucky enough to find a cave right after they
had fled into a new passageway but before any of the flaming
creatures had discovered them. This meant they could rest for a time!
Still, they could only spend a few hours, as there would be flaming
creatures patrolling the entire area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been fifteen
days. Fifteen full days of nonstop running.” The Ninedust Sectlord
shook his head. “These stone passageways are without end. They seem
to be limitless! Every single one of them is filled with countless
flaming creatures, and every single one of them is completely
unkillable. The weakest ones are still comparable to Daolords of the
Fourth Step! Considering how many stone passageways we’ve gone
through, the number of flaming creatures we’ve fought is simply
ridiculous. Why are there so many of them? Logically speaking, there
should be very few creatures which have the power of Daolords of the
Fourth Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“They probably aren’t actual living creatures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “I was about to say the same thing. They
seem to be part of the omnipresent flames of this regioin, as well as
the stone walls of the various stone passageways.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had once
personally witnessed the flaming creatures disappear into the stone
walls like water flowing into a desert, leaving behind no trace of
its passing. It must be understood that neither Ning nor the Ninedust
Sectlord were able to damage the walls at all despite launching
repeated full-strength attacks against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, do you
have any Thousand Origins pills or other similar types of
spirit-pills?” The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning. “If you do,
sell them to me. Judging from the way you fight and how stable you
are, it doesn’t look like you are relying on some sort of forbidden
technique or divine ability that explosively increases your power for
brief periods of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Thousand
Origins pills were used to replenish Immortal energy and divine
power. Using extremely powerful divine abilities or forbidden arts in
battle consumed divine power a hundred times faster than normal; if
the battle went on for too long, one would have to rely on
spirit-pills to replenish one’s energy. The rate at which one
absorbed energy from chaos jewels was simply too slow, and while
chaos nectar was quite fast, using it in this matter was extremely
wasteful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was primarily
relying on the azureflower mist energy in battle; at most, he would
also use the [Three Heads, Six Arms] divine ability, and so very
little of his divine ability was used up. As for the azureflower mist
energy, it was also consumed very slowly, allowing him to replenish
it with chaos jewels alone. As a result, he didn’t need to rely on
using spirit-pills to replenish his energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, when the
Ninedust Sectlord unleashed his full power he remained a bit stronger
than Ning. There was nothing Ning could do about this; the
azureflower mist energy simply couldn’t be used to execute divine
abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you jealous of
my Sword Dao?” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Sword Dao is
indeed formidable; it can be all but described as flawless and
perfect. We encountered several dangerous situations earlier, but you
were able to perfectly defend against all of them. I, however, was
forced to rely on my divine abilities and forbidden arts.” The
Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning. For once, he was willing to give up
a bit of his face. “I imagine you’ve used up very few of your
spirit-pills. Sell some to me. Il’l pay double the normal price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five times the
normal price!” The Ninedust Sectlord said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just looked at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten times!” The
Ninedust Sectlord gritted his teeth. “Darknorth, don’t go too
far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, forget it. I’ll
sell it to you for ten times the normal price them. I was planning to
wait until you were really panicking, then sell them to you at a
hundred times the normal price.” Ning let out a teasing smile. To
sell a spirit-pill at a hundred times the normal price when the buyer
was in mortal danger was quite common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning actually had more
than ten thousand Thousand Origins pills and Chaos Spirit pills. He
had acquired all of them from the deceased Daolord Kongsan, as Ning
himself had never used them before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousand Origins
pills were somewhat cheap; each of them were normally worth around a
thousand cubes of chaos nectar. As for Chaos Spirit pills, they were
worth ten times as much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two completed their
trade. The Ninedust Sectlord spent thirty million cubes of chaos
nectar to buy some of Ning’s spirit-pills. Finally, he let out a
sigh of relief. With these spirit-pills on him, he would be able to
use his powerful divine abilities without fear. In truth, he still
had a good number of spirit-pills on him, but who knew how long they
would be stuck in this place for? These flaming creatures really did
seem to be all but endless, and he was forced to use his forbidden
arts whenever they ran into a bit of trouble. Otherwise, they’d be
swarmed and overwhelmed by the things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was different.
Although he couldn’t use any divine abilities, the unscrutableness
of his Omega Sword Dao allowed him to easily escape his foes, and the
Soleheart stance of his Omega Sword Dao ensured that the creatures
found it nearly impossible to actually reach Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Ninedust,
you haven’t told anything me about yourself yet,” Ning said. “All
I know is that you are the sectlord of the Ninedust Sect, and a new
one at that. But what did you do before becoming the Ninedust
Sectlord? I’ve never heard of you before. It’s odd that such a
powerful Daolord as you suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and you
don’t exactly seem to be the low-key type.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to know
more about me?” The Ninedust Sectlord glanced sideways at Ning,
then said smugly, “I’ll tell you the truth. I’m actually just a
Daolord of the Third Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Third Step?” Ning was surprised. How could a Daolord of the Third
Step be this strong? Didn’t that mean that it was all but
guaranteed he would be the equal of Daolord Dawnstar once he reached
the fourth step?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But your divine
body…?” Ning frowned. The Ninedust Sectlord’s divine body had
an aura of tremendous power, and it was far stronger than the bodies
of most Daolords of the Fourth Step. It was highly unusual for a
Daolord of the Third Step to have a divine body with such a powerful
aura. “Are you some sort of Aberrant, or…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Those Aberrant
special lifeforms are nothing. I am an Ancient cultivator, the most
perfect type of creature to ever exist,” the Ninedust Sectlord
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
Although the Ancient cultivators were one of the six major
organizations in the Endless Territories, they were incredibly few
and rare in number, on par with the Brightshore Imperials of the
Brightshore Kingdom. He didn’t expect that the Ninedust Sectlord
would turn out to be an Ancient cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you’ll find out
soon enough, this is one of the ancestral sites left behind by the
ancestors of my race.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning. “I’m
afraid, Darknorth, that you won’t be able to gain anything at all
from this place, given that it was left by my ancestors for members
of my Ancient race.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An ancestral site of
the Ancient cultivators?” Ji Ning was slightly startled for a
moment, then smiled. “No wonder you insisted on attacking the
Eastroad Sect, and were able to discover the Void Pathway right
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Ninedust
Sectlord glanced at Ning with surprise. “You don’t seem to be
frightened at all. Since this place was left behind by my ancestors,
any treasures or legacies here will probably fall into my hands. As
for you? You might even die here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the point
of being afraid?” Ning said casually. Since they had already come
here and were unable to flee, the only choice they had was to face
everything head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Besides. It’s too
early to speculate as to which one of us will be the one to die. You
were the one getting your rear kicked by those flaming beasts.”
Ning looked quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
really was rather amazed at Ning’s calm aplomb. He hadn’t
revealed the truth previously, but now that both sides had sworn a
binding oath to enter into an alliance and to not attack each other
or plot against each other, the Ninedust Sectlord was finally willing
to divulge the secret of this being an ancestral site for him. As he
saw it, towards the end Ning would still find out, so long as he
survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ninedust, did
you just say that you Ancient cultivators were the most perfect
creatures in the universe? But based on what I’ve heard, the
top-tier Aberrant lifeforms like the Brightshore Imperials are on par
with you Ancient cultivators,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a snort. “Aberrants? They are nothing
more than a random, motley collection of freaks which were born out
of the primordial chaos. There’s far too many breeds of them, which
is why they are just collectively known as the Aberrants. How could
that motley collection of freaks be compared to us Ancient
cultivators? Just mentioning us in the same breath is an insult to
us! As for the Brightshore Imperials, they are a race of Chaos
Godbeasts that have been around just as long as we have. I suppose
they could just barely be considered our peers… but if we really
were to compare our two races, they are still significantly inferior
to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Godbeasts?”
Ning was startled. Although he was a member of the Brightshore
Kingdom, he knew very little regarding the Brightshore Imperials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that you
are unaware of many secrets, most likely because you haven’t been a
Daolord for long.” The Ninedust Sectlord chuckled. “The
Brightshore Imperials consider this information to be a source of
humiliation; there’s naturally no way they would’ve told you
about this. I, however, will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humiliation?” Ning
was quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long, long ago,
there were no such things as ‘cultivators’, and the various
Aberrant lifeforms had yet to learn how to cultivate either! Back
then, the endless primordial chaos gave birth to two types of perfect
lifeforms. The first type was humanoid in shape and was truly
flawless. They were born with transcendant talent and tremendous
comprehension abilities… and they became known as the Ancients. As
for the second type, they were shaped like beasts and so became known
as Chaos Godbeasts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancients were
the first to discover and invent cultivation techniques! As a result,
we became incredibly powerful and ended up unifying the endless
primordial chaos and becoming its master… and this is why we are
known as the Ancient cultivators.” A look of pride was on the
Ninedust Sectlord’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
startled. So the Ancient cultivators were actually the first ones to
create cultivation techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
said smugly, “As for those Aberrant lifeforms, we held no interest
in them whatsoever. The Chaos Godbeasts, however, made for decent
servants. We enslaved them and used them as our mounts, ordering them
about as we pleased.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning could
hardly believe it. The Brightshore Imperials used to be the slaves of
the Ancient cultivators?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, we
Ancient cultivators roamed the universe without equal.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a soft sigh. “Every single member of our
race is born with incredible intelligence and comprehension
abilities, and so we created one new technique after another. Do you
know how many Brightshore Imperials have managed to become Eternal
Emperors? Just one! The Brightshore Hegemon himself! But many Ancient
cultivators have ended up gaining eternity. This is all thanks to our
comprehension abilities! Humanoid lifeforms, by nature, are more
intelligent than animal lifeforms. If the Chaos Godbeasts hadn’t
managed to produce a Hegemon, they would never have reached their
current heights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity, though. That
time ended long ago. Now, it is the era of you normal cultivators.”
The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “You normal cultivators
aren’t nearly as perfect as us, and some of you actually started
off as ordinary mortals and slowly crawled up the ranks of power.
Unfortunately, there are simply far, far too many of you. Even if you
only produce one genius every trillion years, you will eventually
accumulate a ridiculous number of powerful experts. Faced with such
an overwhelming number of normal cultivators, we had no choice but to
retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
looked at Ning. “Darknorth, we Ancients do accept ordinary
cultivators into our ranks as well. So long as you are just an
ordinary member of the Dao Alliance and not a member of the
Brightshore Kingdom, the Aeonian Kingdom, or the Dark Kingdom, we’d
be willing to recruit you. Join us! If you are as talented as I think
you are, you’ll be given the best of resources.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pursed his lips.
They recruited ordinary cultivators? It seemed like everyone was
doing this. The Brightshore Kingdom, the Aeonians… they were all
recruiting as well, with quite a few ordinary World-level cultivators
having been taken on by the Aeonians in particular to serve as their
lackeys. The World-level cultivators Ning had encountered in the
Allgod Estate were mostly ‘ordinary’ cultivators; most of them
didn’t have any Aeonian blood in them at all. Who would’ve
imagined that the Ancient cultivators were also recruiting?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it made sense. The
Brightshore Imperials, the Aeonians, and the Ancients all had the
same problem – they were too few in number!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning eagerly. “Most likely, only
the Dao Alliance has as deep a foundation as us Ancients.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. Let me
think it over first,” Ning said. He had already joined the
Brightshore Kingdom; how could he join their enemies? Still, it was
best to keep the fact that he was a member of the Brightshore Kingdom
secret, in order to avoid any unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush, no rush at
all. Here in the ancestral lands, I trust you’ll soon come to
realize just how incredible we Ancient cultivators are.” The
Ninedust Sectlord smiled. “Later on, I’ll make the introductions
for you.” He was a peerless genius who had mastered and perfectly
joined together two Supreme Daos; even amongst the Ancient
cultivators, he was considered one of the elite chosen of his
generation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, a major power
of the Ancient cultivators had engaged in some divination for him,
letting him know where he should go adventuring and where his destiny
lay. However… in the end, the future would remain unknown.
Numerancy divination could only allow you to see a few scraps and
glimpses of the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. Having
officially joined forces together, Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord
continued to carefully travel through this mysterious region, going
from one stone passageway to the next. There really seemed to be no
end of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them spent
another three full months trapped in this place. Thankfully, Ning had
sold the Ninedust Sectlord a large number of spirit-pills; otherwise,
the latter might not have been able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the final day of the
third month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them and eat
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large group of the
flaming creatures were in hot pursuit of a flying black vessel which
was fleeing from them at incredible speeds while nine awesome secret
arts billowed around it, preventing anyone from drawing near.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black
vessel flew into a different stone passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord were both startled. Moments later, a look of
delight appeared in their eyes. Up ahead was an extremely large and
empty area that was at least a hundred billion kilometers in size. At
the very center of this region was a planet that glowed with light
and emanated an aura of endless might. There were no flames at all in
this entire empty region!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that thus far, every single place the two of them had passed through
had been filled with those terrifying, omnipresent flames. This
region, however, didn’t have a single flame within it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have we reached our
destination?” Ning murmured silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place may well
be the place which the ancestors wished us to reach.” The Ninedust
Sectlord looked at the planet in front of him rather excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past three
months, all they had seen were stone passageways and endless flames!
They had never encountered such a vast, empty region. A hundred
billion kilometers, and a planet in the center of it! The aura of
power emanating off of this planet was so great that Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord both felt rather breathless. This place could very
well be the endpoint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” A group of
flaming beasts burst out of the stone passageway, seeking to chase
down the two of them. However, they suddenly began to slow down as
they looked rather hesitantly at the distant planet in the center.
The flames covering the bodies of the various creatures all seemed to
die down slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and kill
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let them
escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flaming creatures
once more picked up the pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The black
vessel didn’t hesitate at all as it flew straight towards the
planet. The flaming creatures continued their furious chase, but the
closer they moved towards the planet the more they seemed to be
suppressed. The flames disappeared from their body, revealing the
fiery armor, hair, and body which lay underneath! The closer they
moved to the star, the more their aura weakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything has its
bane.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh with amazement when he saw
this. “These flaming creatures were completely unkillable, but as
soon as they started to move towards this planet they began to weaken
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That planet doesn’t
seem to have any effect on us at all.” The Ninedust Sectlord
glanced at the planet warily as they moved closer and closer to it.
“But its aura of power is tremendous. It might hold certain dangers
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at him.
“What of it? Do you want us to go back into the stone passageways?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d have to be mad
to do that,” the Ninedust Sectlord snorted. Clearly, after spending
roughly three months in the stone passageways, he had more than had
his fill of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, we
definitely have to go take a look at this place. Let’s just be
careful,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
stared at the planet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black vessel flew
closer and closer to it, with the flaming creatures still in hot
pursuit but growing weaker by the moment. Finally, they all came to a
halt and let out angry, resentful growls. They had no choice but to
simply watch as the black vessel flew ever-closer to the planet.

Chapter 17 – The Prophets Descend
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black vessel
finally came to a halt outside the star. Ji Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord stood on the prow of the vessel, able to see the planet
clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
star,” Ning praised. The planet was protected by layers of
defenses, almost like the yolk of an egg being protected by a shell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But also dangerous,”
the Ninedust Sectlord warned solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
glanced at the Ninedust Sectlord, who did not respond. Whoosh! The
black vessel began a slow advance, soon arriving in front of the
first barrier protecting the star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a gaseous
barrier that was pitch-black in color and extremely solid. When the
black vessel sought to advance through it, the two could both sense
the first barrier resisting the vessel mightily. The black vessel had
to use all of its power in order to just barely advance through the
barrier, crackling all the way. After advancing for roughly a hundred
thousand kilometers, they left the region of black mist and appeared
in front of a region of deep azure mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that most
Daolords of the Fourth Step wouldn’t be able to make it past this,”
Ning said softly. “If my judgment is correct, there’s no way this
protective membrane could’ve been naturally created. It has to have
been man-made.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Nine out of
ten says it was created by a major power that vastly outstrips us in
might.” The Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The vessel
continued to advance, passing through one layer of gas after another.
There were nine of these gas layers, and they were colored black,
deep azure, azure, light azure… the colors continuously lightened
until the final layer, which was composed of completely white mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the white mist
posed almost negligibly low levels of resistance for the black
vessel. Starting from the azure layer, a few special lifeforms began
to appear. They lived within the gas itself, and were like gaseous
entities. They could transform into any shape, with some being strong
and others being weak. The most powerful were roughly on par with
Daolords of the Fourth Step, while the weakest were on par with
ordinary World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After passing
through the ninth layer of mist, Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord saw a
brand new open world appear in front of them. This was a vast and
beautiful world, filled with cities, villages, and many ordinary
mortals as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this place
actually holds living creatures.” Ning let out a moved sigh. “The
endless primordial chaos truly is filled with endless marvels. Life
can survive in even a dangerous place like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suspect that the
major power who created those nine layers of protective mist did so
for the sake of these mortals.” The Ninedust Sectlord carefully
sent out his senses, then said in a soft voice, “This region is
filled with invisible laws, preventing ordinary cultivators from
beingn able to fly at all. Only Daolords are able to fly here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The skies are
sealed?” Ning frowned. “Can it be that this planet holds an
Eternal Emperor within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon gaining eternity,
your very words became edicts of law. You could issue certain edicts
that all within a certain region had to follow! However, sufficiently
powerful Daolords were capable of completely ignoring these edicts.
It must be understood that certain supremely powerful Daolords were
capable of suppressing even the might of the prime essences of the
Dao, located at the heart of the universe. In comparison, mere edicts
issued by Eternal Emperors were nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This place
might have an ancestor of my Ancient race.” The Ninedust Sectlord
swept the area with his gaze. “Darknorth, I’m sure you’ve
sensed it as well. This vast world gives me an incredibly strong
sense of danger. If we aren’t careful, we could easily die here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I can sense
it.” Ning nodded. As soon as he had seen this planet from afar, he
had sensed a terrifying danger emanating from it. Now that they had
truly entered it, that sense only grew stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of eight
strange-looking four-legged beasts were pulling a giant carriage
through the grassy plains directly below Ning. Surrounding the
carriage there were three hundred valiant knights, all of whom were
advancing at high speeds. The carriage was protected by formations
which faintly flickered around it, ensuring it didn’t bump or
jostle at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The carriage itself was
thirty meters long and twenty-four meters wide. Within the carriage
sat a young man who was casually dressed in sleek silk clothes, as
well as two bewitching women who were cuddling against him while
feeding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth casually ran
his hands across the two women, toying with them. His eyes, however,
had a faraway look in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Highness,
Dragonwing City is up ahead. Should we pay a visit to the governor?”
The voice of a knight rang out from outside the carriage. Although
their lord had already informed them as to which experts they would
visit on this journey, the young master wasn’t the type to just do
as he was told. There were two experts who he had declined to meet
with thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The governor of
Dragonwing is one of my seniors and has always treated me very well.
We certainly must visit him,” the youth chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged,” the
knight said from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth inside the
carriage caressed one of the women by his side, a dreamy look in his
eyes. He murmured softly, “So this is the path which Father has
arranged for me? I can already see what the rest of my life will be
like. I really am not happy with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
Suddenly, two figures appeared out of nowhere. One was a white-robed
youth who bore a black sheath on his back, while the second was an
icy-faced man. However, neither the two women in the carriage nor the
noble youth noticed them at all. The youth remained lost in his
thoughts and pensively pondering his own future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid is one of
the highest status figures without a million kilometers of this
place. He actually has three Elder Gods and five Ancestral Immortals
guarding him, while he himself is also an Elder God. And, judging
from the way they address him, he should be a prince of some sort,”
the Ninedust Sectlord said. “He probably knows more about this
world than most. Darknorth, shall you do the honors or shall I?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll ask,” Ning
said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one in the area was
able to overhear their conversation. They were simply beings on
completely different levels of existence. Although Ning had merely
been an Elder God when he left the Three Realms, he could now wipe
out untold multitudes of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals with but
a single breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
remained quite cautious. They didn’t randomly start sending their
godsense out to investigate, as this world was simply too dangerous
for them. It must be understood that not even those innumerable
flaming creatures dared to approach this region. If they were too
rash, they’d probably die here. Thus, caution was the best
decision. This was a principle which all Daolords followed when they
were out adventuring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord stood at the very precipice of power amongst
Daolords; they could be considered second-tier Daolords of the Fourth
Step by now, comparable to ordinary Eternal Emperors in might. They
naturally had to be cautious. The stronger you were, the more careful
you had to be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a place deep within
the underground of this world. This was a place where ancient
formations could be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly 190 million
kilometers below the ground, there was a beautiful underground
palace. The palace was extremely quiet, and although a few Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals and even World Gods could be seen walking
through it, they were all silent and solemn. None of them dared to
speak too loudly, as they felt a natural sense of dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient,
quiet room inside the underground palace. A white-robed old man was
seated in the lotus position, his aura comparable to that of a
Daolord of the Fourth Step. In front of him was an enormous mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mirror contained
within it images of a black vessel flying through layers of misty
barriers before finally descending upon the vast world up above. This
scene was playing on a loop over and over within the mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder.” Suddnely,
a violet-robed man walked over from afar, emanating the aura of a
Daolord of the Second Step. He called out respectfully to the old
man, but when he accidentally saw the images being played in the
mirror his face turned ashen. He stuttered, “A-a-are those
Prophets?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
white-robed elder let out a sigh. “Prophets! After a million chaos
cycles, yet another group of Prophets have descended upon our world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophets have
descended? Prophets?!” The violet-robed man was shocked and
panicked. “B-but… what should we do? Elder, what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed elder
waved his hand, causing a black tome to appear before him. The tome
opened on its own, and it was filled with the history of this
continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic.”
The white-robed elder said softly, “In the ancient annals of our
continent, it is said that Prophets have descended on three separate
occasions! The first Prophet taught us cultivation, allowing us to
escape our fetters of ignorance and enter the era of Immortal
cultivation. This was the First Era of our continent. The second
Prophet did even more; he established a foundation for us, setting up
the nine sky barriers to protect us and thus ensure that those
flamefiends wouldn’t dare to encroach upon our territory. These
days, only the most crazed of flamefiends would dare to attack, and
they no longer pose much of a threat. As a result, our homeland was
able to grow truly powerful. This was the Second Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the third
Prophet and the Third Era he brought…” The violet-robed man said
nervously, “That was the darkest era of our history.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed elder
nodded. The descent of the third Prophet… that Prophet had simply
been too greedy, and he had caused a huge war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third time, we
were ultimately forced to unleash the power of the Eighteen Heavens
and Hells Mutual Apocalypse Formation. We summoned the enormous power
inherent within this land and in the end were able to slay that
Prophet… but countless living beings in our world were slain as
well, with just the few who hid within the sacred lands surviving.”
The violet-robed man was extremely nervous. That battle had been a
dire one. The entire world had been completely devastated! It had
taken them a million chaos cycles to recover to their current state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whether this is a
blessing or a catastrophe, we still have to face it,” the
white-robed elder said. “No matter what, the descent of the
Prophets means that the Fourth Era has already begun. Inkmind, the
task of making initial contact with those two Prophets shall be
yours.”

Chapter 18 – Young Master Skywind
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the carriage. Ji
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord watched as the youth continued to toy
with his maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, both
of the maids fainted soundlessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The youth’s
face suddenly paled as he stared sideways. Two figures were standing
right next to him, staring back at him. One was a white-robed youth
who bore a black sword sheath on his back, while the other was a
grim-looking man. The white-robed youth had a peaceful aura, and he
most likely wasn’t an evil man, but the faint baleful aura
surrounding the grim-looking man made the youth feel a bit nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was very confident
in his own abilities, and knew himself to be virtually invincible
below the World level. However, these two powerful strangers somehow
managed to enter his carriage without him noticing, and his two maids
had silently fainted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors.” The
youth hurriedly rose to his feet and bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some
questions for you, kid,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please go ahead,
senior,” the youth said immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Introduce yourself
first.” Ning’s voice carried a strange, magical power to it that
compelled the youth to speak. My name is Skywind. I’m the ninth
young master of Skyfiend City, and the governor of the city is my
father. I’ve come on my father’s orders to travel to the Eastvoid
Sword Pavilion to become apprenticed to Swordmaster Eastvoid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind was shocked as
the words came out of his mouth. Why was it that he couldn’t
control his own words?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this ‘Swordmaster
Eastvoid’ a World-level expert or a Samsara Daolord?” Ning asked.
The nearby Ninedust Sectlord listened attentively as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the aura of
danger emanating from this planet, they felt it necessary that they
be low-key in all their actions, which was why they hadn’t acted
too brashly. They didn’t know what type of temper the most supreme
figure on this planet had; if they accidentally offended and made an
enemy out of that person, they could well die if their judgment of
this planet’s danger was correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already
suffered more than enough at the hands of the endless flaming
creatures in the endless stone passageways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a World level
cultivator, of course.” A look of terror was in young master
Skywind’s eyes as he heard himself speak uncontrollably. Why was it
that he was answering every single question posed? “Samsara
Daolords only exist in the legends, and it is incredibly hard to
trace or track them down. How could I possibly take one on as my
master? Swordmaster Eastvoid is nothing more than an extremely famous
expert of the Dao of the Sword. He’s virtually invincible against
other World-level experts, and even my father is far from being a
match for him. My father went to tremendous lengths in order to
convince him to accept me as his disciple. However, I have to first
reach the Eastvoid Sword Pavilion and personally pass a few tests
before being admitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord exchanged glances. World level? To them, even most Daolords
of the Third Step or Fourth Step could be annihilated with a casual
wave, much less World-level cultivators. Both were comparable to
ordinary Eternal Emperors in power, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then do you know
where the Samsara Daolords are?” Ning continued to question him.
The stronger one was, the more one would know. Most likely, the local
Samsara Daolords would know more regarding the secrets of this
planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know. How
could someone like me possibly be aware of what the Samsara Daolords
are doing?” Young master Skywind explained, “Perhaps some of the
most elite World-level cultivators would know a few things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to ask
questions, while young master Skywind continued to respond
automatically. The latter was at the verge of tears; no matter what
the former asked, he was somehow forced to automatically answer with
the utmost of truth. This feeling instilled terror in him. He was
repeatedly reminded as to how powerless he was in the face of this
white-robed, sword-carrying youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long period of
time passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Ning glanced at the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be a bit
troublesome. From the sound of things this planet should indeed have
Samsara Daolords, and several of them at that,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said. “In the Endless Territories, our Daolords will
usually establish their own sects. Here, however, the Daolords all
seem to be in hiding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s go
find someone higher ranked than this ‘Skywind’ kid,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s our only
choice.” The Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were quite
patient. They would rather spend ten extra days quietly investigating
this planet than to blunder rashly into a fight. As the saying went,
only when you understood both yourself and your enemies would you be
the victor in all your battles. This planet was quite possibly an
ancestral site left behind by an ancestor of the Ancient cultivators,
after all; they couldn’t be too rash here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have more
questions for you.” Ning looked at young master Skywind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please go ahead,
senior,” young master Skywind said hurriedly. He had been
completely unable to overhear the conversation between Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord. He knew the situation he was in and was behaving
quite obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who in this general
area would possibly have information regarding where the Samsara
Daolords are?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this general
area, the highest-ranked figure would be the governor of Dragonwing
City. He governs this entire region, and all of the countless living
beings here prostrate themselves before him. He’s on very good
terms with my father, and has been alive for an extremely long period
of time. He surely knows a thousand times more than what I know; he
might know where the Samsara Daolords hide.” Young master Skywind
continued to speak uncontrollably, “I was planning to go pay a
visit to him, as he helped out quite a bit and was instrumental in me
being able to join the Eastvoid Sword Pavilion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Good.
Then we’ll accompany you and visit the governor of Dragonwing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord both remained within the carriage. Young master
Skywind naturally offered all the fine food and wine he had
available. The two maids had awoken by now, and they didn’t dare to
say athing; they naturally understood that they had encountered two
important personages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Glug. Ah, it’s
rare for me to have a chance to relax like this.” The Ninedust
Sectlord drank some fine wine, then let out a relaxed sigh. “It
feels like it has been ages since I had the chance to rest a bit. I
wasn’t able to relax at all back in those stone passageways.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, a relaxed life
is the best life of all.” Ning had also been driven to the point of
near-lunacy by the flaming creatures, but he was now feeling quite
relaxed as well. Suddenly, Ning’s gaze turned towards the inner
walls of the carriage. The walls had some scars carved into them, and
Ning was able to see right away that these were sword-arts scars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
noticed Ning glancing at the walls, and he followed Ning’s gaze.
When he saw the sword-scars on the walls, he let out a laugh. “How
could someone be so shameless as to put such crude sword-arts on
display?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby young master
Skywind instantly began to blush with embarrassment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone knows how
amazing my young master’s sword-arts are. Young master Skywind’s
sword-arts are famed throughout the lands. It was these sword-arts
that resulted in him being allowed to enter the Eastvoid Sword
Pavilion,” one of the maids couldn’t help but argue, her face
flushed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
buried his face in his hands. Oh my god, you stupid woman… why did
you have to say anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This little girl is
pretty devoted to you.” The Ninedust Sectlord chuckled as he looked
at the maid. “She’s clearly terrified, but she still wanted to
speak up on your behalf. But I must tell you, I was speaking the
truth. Your sword-arts truly are crude and ungainly. Hell, forget
about your young master’s sword-arts; even that so-called
Swordmaster Eastvoid’s sword-arts are unspeakably crude. In terms
of sword-arts, the gentleman right in front of you is a true
grandmaster of the Dao of the Sword. No, not me! Stop looking at me.
I’m talking about this fellow Daoist right here. Can’t you tell
he has a sword scabbard on his back? You should be able to tell right
away that he’s a swordsman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but let out a surprised snort of laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ‘Swordmaster
Eastvoid’ or whatever he’s called… everything he knows about
the Dao of the Sword could probably fit within my friend’s
toenails.” The Ninedust Sectlord was clearly in a wonderful mood
and so he spoke in a rather casual manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
immediately turned his gaze towards Ning, his eyes scorching with
eagerness. He was a sword fanatic who was completely devoted to the
sword. This was why he had reached such a high level in sword-arts
and had become famous in this region. He hadn’t left those
sword-scars in the carriage to show off on purpose; rather, even in
this carriage he would often ponder on his sword-arts. When he
sometimes had an epiphany, he would carve it into the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, you are
bragging a bit much,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m doing no such
thing. I’m just telling the truth. That East-whatever, he’s a
mere World-level cultivator. How could he even know as much as 0.01%
of what you know regarding the sword?” The Ninedust Sectlord said
hurriedly, “I’ve never met anyone with stronger sword-arts than
you at your level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Ninedust
Sectlord saw it, Ning was a Daolord of the Third Step who had truly
earth-shaking sword-arts. Once he broke through to become a Daolord
of the Fourth Step, he would probably be on par with Palace Lord
Dawnstar. In truth, however, Ning’s sword-arts could be fairly
described as without peer in all the Endless Territories, because his
Dao was that of the Omega Sword Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior…” Young
master Skywind looked rather eagerly at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little rascal.”
Ning glanced at the carriage walls, then nodded. “I can vaguely see
a total of thirty-six sword-stances within those carvings. You are
fairly impressive for an Elder God… but there is still area for
improvement. You can actually fuse these thirty-six stances into just
three stances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed at the
carriage walls in a very serious manner, and three more sword-scars
instantly appeared on them. All three pulsed with sword-intent, but
very ordinary sword-intent. Ning was just providing guidance, after
all; he was teaching the kid the basics of fusing sword-arts
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In fact, you can
also fuse them into one stance.” Ning pointed again, causing a
fourth streak of sword-intent to appear on the walls. This one was
extraordinarily powerful, and it was infused with a hint of Ning’s
own Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The nearby
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “Kid, today is the luckiest day in your
life. My friend has just created a brand new sword-art based on your
original one. We ate your food and drank your wine, but we don’t
want to owe you anything. If you can fully master just one of those
first three stances, you’ll be able to reach the World level. As
for the final one? If you can master it, you’ll be invincible
amongst World-level experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
stared at the walls of the carriage, completely spellbound.
</P>

Chapter 19 – Within The Governor’s Estate
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
stared at those four sword-scars, especially the three simpler ones.
Countless insights suddenly began to arise in his mind, and he
immediately understood that these three sword-stances alone would
allow his sword-arts to improve dramatically. In fact, they would
even allow him to reach the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He turned his head to
look at Ji Ning, then kowtowed without hesitation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just looked at him
calmly. For him to accept a few kowtows after having bestowed the Dao
upon this young man wasn’t excessive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple greets
you, Master.” Young master Skywind said these words while
kowtowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah? Ahahaha!” The
nearby Ninedust Sectlord started to roar with laughter after a moment
of befuddlement. ‘Darknorth, he’s calling you ‘Master’. Are
you planning to accept him as your disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
just gave him a few casual tips. It can’t be considered as me
having taken him on as my disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, this grand
Dao you have taught me will ensure that I should be able to break
through to reach the World level within a year. How can such a grand
Dao be transmitted without purpose?” Young master Skywind said
hurriedly, “I can understand if you look down on me, senior. You’ve
taught me sword-arts. I might not be a true personal disciple, but I
can be considered an honorary disciple, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite
crafty, junior.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, do you
agree?” Young master Skywind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t mention it
again.” Ning shook his head again. Skywind was quite talented in
the Dao of the Sword, but Ning was currently trapped in an ancestral
site of the Ancients. He had no desire to take on and teach a
disciple at all. Even if he did, he would have to carefully consider
the person’s character first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Skywind nodded obediently. However, he became even more industrious
and humble for the rest of the journey. He knew that a truly great
blessing had befallen him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens. This
person was able to casually condense his thirty-six sword-stances
into three stances, then fuse the three into a single stance.
Supposedly, if he mastered that final stance he would be invincible
even amongst World-level cultivators. What unfathomable level had
that senior reached in sword-arts? A level beyond Skywind’s
imagination, no doubt. He naturally wished to take on such a powerful
figure as his master; even being a mere honorary disciple would be
enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, these two seniors
were not so easily moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few hours later,
young master Skywind’s process reached Dragonwing City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragonwing City was
quite a large city, and it had hundreds of millions of citizens
dwelling within it. This was the headquarters of a World-level
expert, and its streets were three thousand meters wide and filled
with many beauty carriages. However, processions like Skywind’s
which had more than three hundred knights were considered quite
impressive in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, it’ll be up
to you in a bit,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master.” Su Youji was quite excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Su Youji, and the
Ninedust Sectlord accompanied young master Skywind as he entered the
governor’s estate. They went into a guest hall, and none of the
guards or servants in the estate were able to notice the three
Daolords in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwing Governor
was a World-level cultivator who had been living for an extremely
long period of time, and Ning really didn’t have much talent in
control. He was able to deal with Elder God Skywind simply because
the disparity in power was absolutely overwhelming. Taking control
over a World-level cultivator, however, would be a bit tougher. He
might succeed, but if the cultivator had a very tough mind he could
very well fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
had no talent in this regard either, and so in the end Ning chose to
have Su Youji handle things! Su Youji was skilled in the Dao of
control and charm, and for her to deal with a World-level cultivator
was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Skywind, you
came!” Loud laughter rang out from behind the door. Moments later,
a yellow-robed elder walked in, emanating the mighty aura of a Chaos
Immortal. He did not, however, seem to be a World God as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dragonwing
Governor?” Suddenly, three figures appeared within the guest hall.
One of the three, a woman dressed in fiery red robes, spoke out to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are…” The
Dragonwing Governor looked at Su Youji. He went stiff, then his eyes
slowly glazed over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know where
the Samsara Daolords are?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Samsara Daolords
move about unpredictably. Although I’ve met one, I don’t know
where he lives,” the Dragonwing Governor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
watched with amazement. Good heavens. The woman next to these two
seniors was actually able to control the Dragonwing Governor like a
golem? What level of people were these people on?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then do you have a
way to find a Samsara Daolord?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a Chaos
Immortal known as Immortal Slowseal. His master is a Samsara
Daolord,” the Dragonwing Governor said. “It won’t be that hard
to locate him. Once you find him, it’ll be easy to find his
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord revealed looks of delight. Still, this planet truly was
strange. The Samsara Daolords were all in hiding! This was completely
different from the Endless Territories. They all felt that there had
to be some secrets hidden in this place. Only by finding the Samsara
Daolords would they be able to discern the secrets of this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Su Youji
revealed a look of delight. She then used a secret art and sent out a
streak of light from her forehead, sending it into the Dragonwing
Governor’s forehead. Divine runes glowed within the governor’s
eyes. A short while later, he regained consciousness, but a look of
dread and fervor was now in his eyes as he looked towards Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
Mistress,” the Dragonwing Governor said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood that Su Youji must have taken full control over the
Dragonwing Governor. In the past, Feixian the Exalted was extremely
talented in this regard, and she was able to allow even Daolords to
obey her command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long will it
take for us to find Immortal Slowseal?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anywhere from a week
to a month,” the Dragonwing Governor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji glanced at
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord. Ning said, “Governor, you should
immediately begin to search for Immortal Slowseal. Once you find him,
lead us to him immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hear that?” Su
Youji looked at the governor, who frantically nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
governor said. “I’ll go handle this right now.” He then
immediately unleashed his Immortal energy, sending mental orders to
his subordinates to locate Immortal Slowseal. He had been here for
countless years and had many friends. It wouldn’t be too hard to
locate the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The governor looked at
Skywind, then revealed a smile. “Skywind, my dear nephew, I have to
thank you. It was all thanks to you that I now have a chance to serve
my new master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once this matter
ends, I’ll dispel my secret art,” Su Youji said to Skywind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please don’t,
Mistress. I wish to serve you unto death,” the Dragonwing Governor
said with agitation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind was stupefied.
The governor’s memories and intelligence hadn’t been affected in
the slightest, but he now was filled with the utmost of loyalty and
dedication towards Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
took up residence in Dragonwing City for now. They were all quite
patient, and it was only through patience that they would ensure they
would be able to survive this dangerous place. If they were
impatient, they would die quick deaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the fifth day of
them being in the governor’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A giant azure
bird that was three thousand meters long was flying through the skies
of Dragonwing City. A pavilion was located on top of the bird’s
back, and a simian-looking alien man was seated casually within the
pavilion. He was surrounded by a large group of female servants, and
one of them with the aura of an Ancestral Immortal was in his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve arrived at
Dragonwing City, my pretty. The kid named Skywind is in that city
right now,” the alien man said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t wait to
see that look of rage and grief on his face,” the woman said
coquettishly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this planet, it was
almost impossible to fly via magic treasures as the skies were sealed
as though by edict. Most likely, only Samsara Daolords would be able
to resist that disruptive power and use their Immortal energy and
artifacts to fly. However, there were some natural creatures such as
birds which were not bound, and so some cultivators would capture
giant birds to serve as mounts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind!” The
alien man glanced downwards, then spoke out in a booming voice that
was backed by his Immortal energy and which shook the governor’s
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, both the
Dragonwing Governor and young master Skywind appeared in front of the
courtyard. As for the giant bird, it slowly began to descend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother
Mountainplume?” The Dragonwing Governor said hurriedly, “Have you
come to bring Skywind to the Eastvoid Sword Pavilion? But the
appointed date is more than half a year away. There was no need for
you to come so soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind glanced at the
sharp-lipped, ape-faced man within the pavilion atop the giant bird,
and also at the violet-robed woman in his arms. When he saw the
violet-robed woman, his face turned pale and a look of grief appeared
on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind this is
Immortal Mountainplume. He’s the eldest disciple of Swordlord
Eastvoid and has entered the World level already. In the future,
he’ll be your senior apprentice-brother,” the Dragonwing Governor
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Skywind’s
gaze was focused on the violet-robed woman, who merely smiled coldly
in response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s my woman.
How dare you stare at her like that?” The ape-faced man said
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind!” The
Dragonwing Governor barked softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
shook his head. “It’s nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come on
Master’s orders,” the ape-faced man said. “This kid, Skywind,
has an impure Dao-heart and is not worthy of joining the Eastvoid
Sword Pavilion. Kid, there’s no need for you to waste your time
going to the pavilion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The
Dragonwing Governor’s face turned pale. He said hurriedly, “We
already came to an agreement, and the Windfiend Governor has already
sent quite a few gifts…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We only said we’d
give him a chance. He’d only be formally accepted once he passed
our tests . Clearly, the kid failed.” The ape-faced man said
coldly, “As for the Windfiend Governor, who gives a damn about him?
Would he dare go against my master’s orders?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwing Governor
had an ugly look on his face. As for young master Skywind, he ground
his teeth, furious at the insult to his father and heartbroken by
that woman. This was the only woman he had ever loved… but it had
all been nothing more than a sinister ploy. To this very day, she was
still causing trouble for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind, compared to
Immortal Mountainplume you are absolutely nothing.” The
violet-robed woman leaned against the ape-faced man, then let out a
cold smile. “You want to become Swordmaster Eastvoid’s disciple?
Stop dreaming. Go home and hide in your father’s protective
embrace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Become my master’s
disciple? Even if you knelt in front of me and begged to be my
disciple, I wouldn’t accept you,” the ape-faced man said
mockingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind’s face grew
even uglier to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Endure it for now.
Neither your father nor I can afford to make enemies out of the
Eastvoid Sword Pavilion,” the Dragonwing Governor sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
the governor’s estate were Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord, who were
sipping some wine alongside Su Youji. Their gazes were able to
traverse the void and see everything which was happening in front of
the estate.
</P>

Chapter 20 – Learning From Heaven and Earth
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I really
don’t like the look of that ‘Immortal Mountainplume’ fellow.”
Su Youji looked at Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“No rush.” He turned his gaze to the distant young master
Skywind, then began to scry the young man’s destiny. It was quite
difficult to scry the man’s future, as he was an Elder God who
would soon reach the World level; to scry his future was extremely
difficult. To scry his past, however, was fairly easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The future had yet to
happen; all things were possible. The past, however, had already
ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windfiend Governor
was a World-level cultivator who had been alive for an extremely long
period of time. He was a very tyrannical figure who had countless
beautiful concubines. Although it was very difficult for World-level
cultivators to have children, over the course of many years he sired
a total of nine sons and daughters, with Skywind being the youngest
of the nine. Skywind’s mother died when he was young, and so he was
a very solitary person as a child. After he grew up, he eventually
encountered a dazzling beauty known as Fairy Violetlotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Violetlotus was
warm and gentle towards him, causing him to feel that the world was
truly a beautiful place. He immediately felt certain that she would
be his Dao-companion, his eternal Dao-companion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that this most blissful period of his life would transform into a
nightmare? The woman suddenly displayed an overwhelming level of
power, crippling his cultivation base. She tortured him, sending his
body into a hell of pain… but to him, the spiritual pain he
suffered was far more nightmarish. His one and only love had
transformed into nothing more than a cruel plotter. The only reason
she had befriended him was to torment him to get back at the
Windfiend Governor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later on, the Windfiend
Governor found his son, saved him, restored and repaired his body,
then helped his son return to the path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But from this day
forth, young master Skywind’s heart was forever filled with hidden
pain. In fact, he decided that he would never feel love towards
another woman again. And so, he began to roam the world, adventuring
through its mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windfiend Governor
no longer held many hopes for his youngest son; he had always been a
solitary figure, and he was very slow in cultivation. As a result, he
chose to just let his son do as he pleased. Who would’ve thought
that Skywind would suddenly take a liking to sword-arts while out
touring the world? He became completely infatuated with sword-arts,
taking on the natural world of Heaven and Earth as his master. He
developed increasingly powerful sword-arts based on the natural world
and soared into the skies. In just a hundred thousand years, he
reached the Elder God stage and was virtually invincible within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning
revealed a stunned look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Su Youji and the Ninedust Sectlord both looked towards Ning, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” But Ning
was still unable to disguise his shock. This ‘young master Skywind’
had never trained under any master at all? He had learned from the
workings of Heaven and Earth, yet had managed to reach his current
level of cultivation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when the
Ninedust Sectlord had mocked his sword-arts as unspeakably crude,
that was in comparison to Ji Ning. In truth, Skywind had reached an
incredible level for an Elder God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually this
talented in sword-arts?” Ning glanced at the distant Skywind, then
nodded slightly. “And he’s not a bad person.” Ning cared more
about character when considering whether or not to take on a
disciple; talent was of secondary concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave.”
Immortal Mountainplume and Fairy Violetlotus retired into their
pavilion atop the giant bird. While leaving, Fairy Violetlotus
glanced sideways at young master Skywind, then smirked. “You’ll
never recover from this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
just looked at her silently. Although he felt pain in his heart, he
bore no hatred for her. Even the most detestable of people had their
own pitiable attributes. The reason why Fairy Violetlotus had treated
him like that was principally due to the great grudge she bore for
the Windfiend Governor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flying
beast spread its wings, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwing Governor
shook his head and sighed upon seeing this. “Skywind, Immortal
Mountainplume must’ve caused trouble in secret. He’s Swordmaster
Eastvoid’s favored disciple; if he’s insistent on causing
trouble, it’ll be impossible for you to be able to enter the
Swordmaster’s tutelage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine,”
young master Skywind said. “But Father will be very disappointed
once he learns this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind.” A voice
suddenly rang out by Skywind’s ears. Skywind was stunned to hear
this voice. It was Ji Ning’s. “Come to me, immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Skywind
didn’t dare to tarry; he hurried ran towards Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Su Youji, and the
Ninedust Sectlord all sat down to eat and drink. Right at this
moment, young master Skywind came. He immediately bowed respectfully.
“Greetings, seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind.” Ning
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Skywind
looked back at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled at him.
“You’ve been wanting to become my disciple, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind was stunned for
a moment, then was overjoyed and fell to his knees and kowtowed.
“Your disciple greets you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you…?”
The Ninedust Sectlord was amazed, as was Su Youji. They knew what
level of power Ning had reached. If he publicly announced in the
Endless Territories that he was about to accept a disciple, countless
World-level geniuses would fight over the chance. In fact, there were
even some Samsara Daolords who would come apprentice themselves to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
Ninedust Sectlord and Su Youji, then chuckled. “I wanted to take
him on, so I did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning acted in
accordance with his heart when he chose disciples. When he had been
in the alternate universe, he had taken a liking to ‘Green Bamboo’
Yang Quding and so had taken him on as his second disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he saw the past of
his third disciple, Skywind, Ning felt a hint of empathy for him.
Skywind had been hurt by love, while Ning felt remorse and regret
towards his own wife Yu Wei. Skywind was incredibly talented in the
Dao of the Sword, and so focused all of his efforts on it. Ning
suddenly decided to give the kid a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
you shall be my third disciple,” Ning said. “Now that you are
under my tutelage, you must obey my commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Skywind immediately said gratefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded,
then stretched out a finger and waved it lightly. The tip of the
finger tapped Skywind on his forehead. Instantly, a large amount of
information poured into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were cultivation
techniques! The Dao of the Sword! Everything was transmitted to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Daos which
Ning transmitted to him were, respectively, the [Blood Drop]
sword-art, the [Shadowless] sword-art, the [Soleheart] sword-art, the
[Yin-Yang] sword-art, and the [Heavenbreaker] sword-art. Any of the
five would allow him to become a Daolord. Ning also left behind two
powerful types of sword-intent; the first was of his first-stage
Omega Sword Dao, the second was of his second-stage Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These five
sword-arts can be merged together. Only then shall you see my true
Sword Dao. You should constantly meditate on these two types of
sword-intent. The amount you can comprehend, however, will be
determined by your talent,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All cultivators had to
walk their own paths if they wished to become a Daolord. Just
teaching a few sword-stances wouldn’t be of much help, and so Ning
went ahead and gave him two memories of Ning’s own sword-intent.
Skywind was to meditate on them. Perhaps he would one day develop his
own Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you are in
danger, you can even summon these two streams of sword-intent forth
from your mind. The first stream of sword-intent is capable of
slaying most Daolords of the Third Step, while the second stream is
capable of slaying of ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-intent is
primarily meant to help you train in the Dao. Unless absolutely
necessary, do not unleash them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember… all
divine abilities and secret arts are outside sources of power. You
can learn them, but you cannot abandon your own Sword Dao for them.
The Dao is the foundation of everything,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t transmit
any divine abilities or secret arts. This planet was quite an
extraordinary one; if his disiciple wished to learn them, he could go
adventure for them himself. And, to tell the truth, Ning really
didn’t have any good divine abilities or secret arts to pass on.
The good ones he did have, such as the ones the deceased Sword
Hegemon gave him, were not permitted to be taught to others!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was also correct
in stating that the ‘Dao’ was the foundation of all things. The
more powerful your Dao is, the less meaningful those divine
abilities, secret arts, and what-not were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when the
Ninedust Sectlord used his divine ability, his divine power would
instantly become a thousand times more powerful than before. However,
his actual combat strength would only increase fractionally! This was
because the power of his ‘Dao’ made up for most of his power in
combat. If Ning became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, a single glance
from him could cause ruinous damage. Thus far, he had merely reached
the second-stage Omega Sword Dao, but the power of his sword-intent
was more greater than his novessence water and could easily
annihilate Daolords of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind swore a
lifeblood oath not to disobey Ning’s commands. After completely
receiving Ning’s transmitted memories, a new, vast Dao was visible
before him. The two sword-intents of an Omega Sword Dao… they would
be lamps that guided him on his path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master,”
young master Skywind said excitedly. These two streams of
sword-intent were too unfathomably profound, but the five sword-arts
formed a perfect circle that would guide him from all the way from
being an Elder God to becoming a Daolord. Every single stance was
described in great detail, and it also explained the process by which
Ning gained insight into these Daos. They were of tremendous use to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t get
involved into your personal issues. You’ll have to handle
everything,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Skywind said. He did indeed have some things he wished to do, but in
the past he was too weak. Now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, you need to
stay by my side for a period of time,” Ning said. “If you have
any questions, I can answer them for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sooner or later, he
would leave this place. He certainly couldn’t take this new
disciple with him when he did, as each had their own paths to walk.
This was how Ning treated his disciples. Take his second disciple for
example; after transmitting the Dao to him, Ning immediately
disappeared. That second disciple lived in a fairly ordinary mortal
world, after all; this third disciple lived in a somewhat more
powerful planet, and so Ning had left those two streams of
sword-intent to ensure that he would be protected while he was weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for afterwards?
Whether he lived or died would be up to him.

Chapter 21 – Immortal Slowseal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine more days went
past before the Dragonwing Governor finally found traces of Immortal
Slowseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
Dragonwing Governor hurriedly came running to report to Su Youji, Ji
Ning, and the Ninedust Sectlord. “Immortal Slowseal is currently a
guest at the Hiddensea Palace, roughly a hundred million kilometers
from this place. He’s quite some distance away. It’ll probably
take us some time to get there, and so I’ve made the arrangements
for transport birds and mounts to be prepared for us. We can head out
whenever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll head out
right now.” Ji Ning rose to his feet, then waved his hand and
caused a black flying vessel to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll fly over?”
Skywind and the Dragonwing Governor were rather speechless when they
saw the vessel. It must be understood that this planet was bound by
the edicts of an Eternal Emperor, and the invisible laws made it so
that only Samsara Daolords were just barely able to fly. Samsara
Daolords, however, were incredibly rare. Neither of the two had ever
truly flown in the air before using magic treasures before; at most,
they had flown on the backs of giant birds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move it!” Ning, Su
Youji, and the Ninedust Sectlord were already aboard the vessel, and
they barked impatiently to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-yes.” The
Dragonwing Governor excitedly followed after them, and Skywind was
similarly unable to disguise his excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The black
vessel burst into the skies, then immediately disappeared without a
trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
long ago acquired a local map of this planet from the Dragonwing
Governor. They knew where the Hiddensea Palace was located, and the
planet itself wasn’t that large; at most, it was a bit over one
billion kilometers in diameter. The ordinary mortals on this planet
were fewer in number than even in the Three Realms, but on average
they were more impressive as the rate at which they gave birth to
Immortals and Fiendgods was far higher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Just a few
heartbeats later, the black vessel had already left the Dragonwing
Governor’s estate and arrived directly above the top of a
cloud-piercing snowy mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are,” Ning
said. “Hiddensea Palace is right below us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? We arrived?”
The Dragonwing Governor and Skywind stood at the prow of the ship,
staring in astonishment at the scene below them. The mountain peak
below them was covered with snow, with an ordinary-looking palace
buried below it. This was Hiddensea Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We made it there in
one breath.” The Dragonwing Governor and Skywind exchanged glances.
Both of them felt stunned. That had been simply too fast! To them,
Hiddensea Palace was an extremely distant location that would only be
reached through riding birds or mounts. The path was a dangerous,
twisty one that needed careful navigation, and it would take them at
least half a month to reach it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninedust
Sectlord chuckled. “This ship can move at a hundred times the
limits of the Heavenly Daos. A hundred million kilometers is nothing
to it. You! Whats-your-face, Dragonwing Governor, right? Hurry on
down and lead us to Immortal Slowseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. Skywind,
follow me and stay behind me. As for the three of you?” The
Dragonwing Governor hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll go with
you,” the Ninedust Sectlord said calmly. “No one in this puny
little palace can possibly see through our illusions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
Dragonwing Governor acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwing Governor
led the party while the other four temporarily followed behind him as
he entered Hiddensea Palace. The former was a World-level cultivator,
after all. He was on the same level as the Palace Lady and so was
received with great courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dragonwing.” The
Palace Lady was a black-robed woman who looked quite ordinary but who
had an extraordinary demeanor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hiddensea.” The
Dragonwing Governor hurriedly rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What suddenly brings
you to my place? Dragonwing City is quite distant from my palace. To
think that you made the long, hard trek here in person… might I
ask, what is the reason behind this?” The Palace Lady smiled. Her
gaze just briefly lingered on Ning and the rest of the four behind
the Dragonwing Governor. She noticed nothing remarkable about them at
all; the difference in power between them was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘long, hard
trek’? The Dragonwing Governor couldn’t help but sigh to himself.
It had all been done in the twinkling of an eye. However, he didn’t
expose this. “Hiddensea, I’ve come to meet with fellow Daoist
Slowseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meet Slowseal?”
The Palace Mistress frowned. “Immortal Slowseal is a rather
bad-tempered person. If I didn’t have something important I needed
him for, I would never have invited him over. Why are you causing
problems for yourself?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have something
important to discuss as well,” the Dragonwing Governor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace Mistress
gave him a hard look, then nodded. “Fine. I’ll help you send
word, but you know what Slowseal is like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” The
Dragonwing Governor nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments passed as
she conversed with Immortal Slowseal. “Let’s go. I just checked
and Slowseal agreed to meet with you. I’ll take you to him.” She
led the Dragonwing Governor deeper into the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
they arrived within the most beautiful courtyard within the Hiddensea
Palace. A horned, black-haired elder was seated within it, drinking
some wine. When the Dragonwing Governor brought Ning and the others
in, the black-haired elder’s eyes twitched. He glanced sideways at
the four, then frowned and barked at the Palace Mistress, “Hiddensea,
bringing in Dragonwing is one thing, but why have you brought in a
group of juniors?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m to blame for
that.” The Dragonwing Governor hurriedly smiled. “It has nothing
to do with Palace Mistress Hiddensea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace Mistress
just stood there silently. She knew quite well that Immortal Slowseal
was doing this to knock the Dragonwing Governor down a few pegs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-haired elder let out a snort. “Throw these juniors out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” The
Dragonwing Governor was stunned. As for Ning, Su Youji, and the
Ninedust Sectlord, they revealed looks of resignation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” The Ninedust
Sectlord let out a sigh, and as he did an invisible aura of power
blasted out from around him, causing Skywind, the Dragonwind
Governor, the Hiddensea Palace Mistress, and Immortal Slowseal to all
feel their hearts quiver. The entire world seemed to have turned
silent. Heaven and Earth had both vanished, leaving nothing else save
his voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to resolve
this peacefully and have a nice chat with Immortal Slowseal’s
master.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “I didn’t
imagine him to be such a fool. It seems we’ll have to do things the
hard way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
indeed been planning on doing things peacefully. This planet was
mysterious and inscrutable; they didn’t want to accidentally kick
over a hornet’s nest. Unfortunately, this Immortal Slowseal was a
bit too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Why is this happening? W-who are they?!” Immortal Slowseal was
panicking, and the Hiddensea Palace Mistress was amazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slowseal actually
has a Daolord as his master. It’s fine for him to be proud, but his
pride goes too far.” Ning shook his head slightly as well. People
truly did act differently once they had a powerful backer. In the
Badlands Territory, if you encountered a disciple of the Badlands
Court you generally wouldn’t dare to attack even if you were much
stronger! As for the likes of the Skykwood Sect of Skywood City, one
of the eight Sacred Cities? Whenever the weakest members of Skywood
Sect so much as mentioned their sect, World-level cultivators and
weaker Daolords would be utterly terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the good part
of having a strong backer. This was why so many World-level
cultivators wanted to join major schools, but the Badlands Court and
Vastheaven Palace had very high standards. As for the Skywood Sect
and other sects on its level, their standards were even more
excessive. Thus, the World-level cultivators who weren’t able to
join the major sects were forced to hide in one place. When trouble
came knocking, they had no choice but to fight head-on… and if they
failed, they would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you had a powerful
background, even if you couldn’t win the fight you could report
your name and thus stay alive in that way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like what
the Paragon of Pills had told Ning: “If you ever find yourself in a
life-threatening situation, you can use my name!” Her being his
backer would overawe many attackers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-who are you?”
Immortal Slowseal was rather panicked. “My Master is Daolord Feng
Xian.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid…” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s face was dark, and his voice was cold and grim.
Waves suddenly arose in the area around him, swirling around him with
torrential voice and filling Immortal Slowseal’s entire field of
vision, making him feel as though they were about to drown him. The
power held within the waves caused Immortal Slowseal to feel a sense
of endless terror. Horrified, Slowseal immediately produced a jade
talisman, then crushed it with a cracking sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is going
to arrive soon! Don’t do anything crazy!” Immortal Slowseal said,
terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The
Ninedust Sectlord started to laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
started to laugh as well. “Ninedust, I thought we’d have to
threaten him a bit before his master would arrive. I never would’ve
thought he’d panic so badly that he’d immediately crush a
Dao-seal to summon his master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was planning to
torment him a bit. Now, it seems, he’s quite a clever boy.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a chuckle as the waves around him all
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone else,
including Immortal Slowseal and Palace Mistress Hiddensea, felt their
hearts quiver as their legs turned to jelly. Prior to this, Ning’s
group had shown them no enmity and had completely masked their auras,
making it so that Immortal Slowseal could sense no power at all. Now
that they fully released their auras, they felt an instinctive,
bone-deep terror in their hearts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-where did all
these terrifying figures come from?” Immortal Slowseal felt misery
in his heart.

Chapter 22 – Outlander Demons
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very peak of a
desolate mountain. A gray-robed man was seated here in the lotus
position. He had been seated here for more than a hundred thousand
years, ignoring the howling of the wind and the beating of the rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, this
world is simply too small.” The gray-robed man raised his head to
stare into the skies. “I need to do the same thing the other major
powers did; leave this world, fight my way through the endless demons
of the outlands, and then enter the wider world beyond. According to
what the legendary Prophets said, the world beyond ours is vast and
filled with countless cultivators. It is a world trillions of times
greater than ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That place is the
place I should be in!” A look of desire was in the gray-robed man’s
eyes. Leaving this world and entering the outlands carried a high
risk of death, but generations of Daolords continued to do just that.
In the end, this world was simply too small, even smaller than the
Three Realms. For figures as powerful as Daolords, spending a few
dozen chaos cycles in such a small place left them with little to no
interest in it at all. They wanted to explore the wider, more
exciting world outside, especially after they had learned from the
Prophets who had descended as to just how amazing that world was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m not quite
there yet. I should first become a Daolord of the Fourth Step. Then,
I might perhaps be able to leave.” The gray-robed man nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The gray-robed
man suddenly turned his head to stare in a certain direction. He
frowned. “Why is my disciple suddenly asking for rescue via his
message-talisman?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was puzzled.
This world was fairly small, and all the Daolords within it knew each
other. As a result, even if they chose to punish his disciple for
some reason they would first give him, Daolord Feng Xian, a heads up.
This particular disciple, Slowseal, was very attentive and obedient.
As a result, Daolord Feng Xian liked him very much. In addition,
Slowseal had no chance of becoming a Samsara Daolord, nor did he ever
go out adventuring. That was why this didn’t make sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t out
adventuring and Daolords wouldn’t attack him. Why then was he
begging for aid?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Although quite
puzzled, Daolord Feng Xian immediately flew into the skies towards
the direction the plea had come from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A courtyard within the
Hiddensea Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Su Youji, and
the Ninedust Sectlord were seated here casually, chatting and
drinking wine. Skywind and the Dragonwing Governor stood next to
them, while Palace Mistress Hiddensea hurriedly attended to their
every need, pouring wine and delivering platters of fruit. As for
Immortal Slowseal, he watched from a distance, his heart filled with
terror and unease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
suddenly descended from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Immortal
Slowseal raised his head, a look of delight on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There he is.”
Ning, the Ninedust Sectlord, and Su Youji all turned their heads to
stare at the gray-robed man descending from the skies. The man’s
gaze instantly fell upon Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
gray-robed man’s face changed. He was a Daolord of the Third Step;
there was no way those three Daolords could mask their auras in front
of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” the
gray-robed man roared. He didn’t care about Su Youji, but Ning’s
aura was that of a Daolord of the Third Step. As for the Ninedust
Sectlord, his aura was even more powerful and terrifying than that of
a Daolord of the Fourth Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never met you
three before. You shouldn’t be from our world.” The gray-robed
man had an ugly look on his face as he roared angrily, “Are you
outlander demons?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outlander demons?”
The Dragonwing Governor and Skywind all stared at Ning’s group,
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outlander demons…
here in this world, those things were creatures of nightmares! Once
outlander demons appeared, everyone would pay any price necessary to
wipe them out – this was a shared acknowledgement amongst all
cultivators in this world! Skywind and the Dragonwing Governor had
heard stories of outlander demons since they were young; they knew
that every appearance of an outlander demon represented a calamity
descending upon their world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. There’s
no way my master could be an outlander demon.” Skywind couldn’t,
wouldn’t, believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outlander demons?”
Ning’s group of three exchanged glances. This world was indeed
filled with many flaming creatures who were known as outlander
demons. They were incredibly powerful creatures, and some of them
dared to enter this world. Although they would be suppressed by the
might of this planet, ensuring that their power dropped dramatically,
the ones who did dare to enter here were always amongst the most
supreme of the flaming creatures and were at least at Ji Ning’s
level. Some were even stronger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, upon
entering this planet and being weakened by it they would become far
weaker than Ning or the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed man
immediately sent a message back to the sacred grounds. “Three
strange figures have appeared, and their auras are at the Daolord
level. One has an aura even stronger than that of a Daolord of the
Fourth Step. I suspect he is a transformed demon from the outlands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beautiful underground
palace located roughly 190 million kilometers benearth the ground.
One of Daolord Feng Xian’s avatars was located here, and it
immediately sent out the word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Daolords? One
has an aura even greater than that of a Daolord of the Fourth Step?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient,
still room. A white-robed elder was seated in the lotus position
here, and by his side was a violet-robed man who was also seated in
the lotus position. The walls around them were filled with countless
ancient runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should be the
two Prophets and their servant,” the white-robed elder said.
“Inkmind, go and pay a visit to those two Prophets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged,” the
violet-robed Daolord Inkmind said respectfully
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
behaving with caution, but the ‘sacred grounds’ which had unified
this planet were similarly cautious. The wealth which had been built
up in the sacred grounds over the course of countless years was more
than enough to stir Prophets with greed! That was exactly what had
happened last time, and a disaster had befallen the world as a
result. As a result, the sacred grounds behaved very cautiously. At
first, they had been able to track Ning’s descent through the nine
barriers around their world, but they were unable to track them
afterwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could’ve
forcibly swept the world through their godsense, but they wanted to
avoid unnecessary trouble. They chose to wait and see what the two
Prophets would do first, leaving the initiative to them. Given how
powerful the Prophets were, it was impossible for them to remain
completely hidden within this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know
exactly how you should deal with the Prophets,” the white-robed
elder said. “We naturally wish to act in a friendly manner, but if
they leave us no choice then we can choose to battle them and wipe
them out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Daolord Inkmind said respectfully. Last time, they were only forced
to use a world-destroying measure to kill the Prophet because they
had been caught off-guard. As a result, virtually all living
creatures on the surface of the world had been wiped out as well.
Fortunately, the ‘sacred grounds’ still held living beings within
it, and over the course of countless years they slowly propagated to
the point of allowing the world to flourish once more. This time, if
they felt that the Prophets were likely to cause trouble they would
choose to immediately kill them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daolord Inkmind
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve never
experienced two Prophets descending together. I hope things can be
resolved peacefully,” the white-robed elder murmured softly in his
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere in the
courtyard was very tense and heavy. Daolord Feng Xian stared
unblinkingly at Ning’s group, certain that they were outlander
demons. The only people who came from the outlands were either demons
or Prophets. Prophets? From the day this entire planet was created
til now, there had only been three times that Prophets had descended.
The chances of this happening were incredibly low. Although outlander
demons were also fairly rare, they were far more common by
comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way
Master and the others are outlander demons.” The nearby Skywind
continued to refuse to believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Just two
seconds after the two sides first began to face off, a golden vessel
suddenly appeared in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They came.”
Daolord Feng Xian revealed a look of delight when he saw that flying
vessel. The sacred grounds had sent him reinforcements. He truly
hadn’t been certain of victory if he had to face this alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are incredibly
fast. That ship moved at roughly a hundred times the speed of light.”
Ning and the others raised their heads, watching the flying vessel
approach them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A violet-robed man
walked out of the flying vessel, a smile on his face as he descended
towards the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Inkmind?”
Daolord Feng Xian revealed a puzzled look. Daolord Inkmind had a
fairly special position in the sacred grounds, because he was the
retainer of their most important leader, the ‘Grand Elder’.
However, Inkmind himself was merely a Daolord of the Second Step; he
was even weaker than Feng Xian. If even Feng Xian didn’t feel
confident in being able to deal with these outlander demons, what
good would Inkmind be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Daolord Inkmind
descended, he turned his gaze towards Ning’s group of three. He had
already seen the images of them piercing through the nine barriers
and descend to their planet, and so he was able to recognize them at
a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Inkmind.
Greetings, Prophets.” Daolord Inkmind bowed. “When the two of you
passed through the nine celestial barriers, those of us in the sacred
grounds immediately realized that you had arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophets?” Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord traded glances. So they had already been
discovered when piercing through those nine barriers of mist? But
they hadn’t noticed anything at all! Still, it made sense; those
nine barriers did indeed seem to have been artificially created by a
major power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are Prophets?”
Daolord Feng Xian revealed a stunned look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. To be precise,
these two are Prophets.” Daolord Inkmind nodded as he pointed
towards Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord. “I’ve come on the orders
of the Grand Elder. There’s no mistaking it; these two are
Prophets. Prophets, would you be willing to share my ship and journey
to the sacred grounds? I trust many of your questions will be
resolved once you do.”

Chapter 23 – Sacred Grounds
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophets?” The
Dragonwing Governor, Palace Mistress Hiddensea, and Immortal Slowseal
were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophets?” Skywind
looked at his master, Ji Ning, in confusion as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them had ever
heard of the term ‘Prophet’ before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen?”
Daolord Inkmind looked towards Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two exchanged a
glance, then chuckled. The Ninedust Sectlord said, “Let’s go take
a look. I want to see what the so-called ‘sacred grounds’ of this
planet look like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, you can
dispel your secret art now,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji nodded obediently, then released a strange rainbow light from
her eyes as she glanced at the Dragonwing Governor. The latter felt
dizzy for a moment, but when he regained his clarity of mind he
quickly realized that he had spent the past period of time under the
dazzlingly beautiful red-robed woman’s spell. Although she had
already dispelled it, he still couldn’t help but feel a deep sense
of veneration and desire towards her. He wanted to swear to forever
serve her, but his rational mind told him to stay calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind, follow me.”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord both walked towards the golden flying
vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Skywind and Su Youji both followed the two ‘Prophets’ as they
entered the flying vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daolord Inkmind
took control of the vessel, and the group of five quickly disappeared
into the distant horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Feng Xian
watched as they left, a frown on his face. “Two Prophets have
descended. If they truly are Prophets… I wonder if this will be a
blessing or a disaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Dragonwing
Governor, he raised his head to stare into the skies. No matter how
he tried, he couldn’t wipe out Su Youji’s image from his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Inkmind led
them to a wooden house guarded over by a Daolord. A miniature
teleportation array was set up within the wooden house, and it sent
them directly into the depths of the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">190 million kilometers
underground. Whoosh. Ning’s group of five suddenly appeared out of
nowhere within an enormous plaza that was studded with black
gemstones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a palace of
utterly enormous size, especially given that its underground. Judging
from the power of the formations protecting it… someone truly
impressive must have set this place up.” Ning let out an amazed
sigh. He saw endless ripples of terrifying power radiate out from the
vast palace, with countless ancient seals and barriers active.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our sacred
underground palace which was created by the most powerful of the
Prophets, our ‘sacred ancestor’.” Daolord Inkmind’s eyes
flashed with pride. “When the Sacred Ancestor descended upon our
world, he guided us, taught us, and eventually completed his Daomerge
here in our world, gaining eternity for himself. It was all thanks to
him that we have had the chance to flourish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Eternal Emperor?”
Both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord were surprised. Even young master
Skywind, who was following after them obediently, was secretly
surprised. He had learned Ning’s legacy and so he knew what the
various levels of cultivation were. He knew that after the World
level the next level was that of the Samsara Daolords, where each
step represented walking a fine line between life and death. Above
them was the level of Daomerged Eternal Emperors! According to what
Ning’s legacy had taught him, less than one in a hundred thousand
ordinary Daolords would gain eternity and become Eternal Emperors.
Their ‘Sacred Ancestor’ was actually one of them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Inkmind, tell me more. What are Prophets and who was this Sacred
Ancestor?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Daolord Inkmind nodded. “Long, long ago, living beings arose on our
planet but knew nothing of cultivation. As a result, they lived
brutish, barbaric lives. Every so often, outlander demons would
descend upon the world, bringing death and despair to countless
living beings. Everyone lived short, dangerous lives, with many being
forced to hide deep underground in order to stay alive. But one day,
the first Prophet descended from the outlands into our planet. His
heart was filled with pity towards all living beings, and so he
taught us cultivation techniques, allowing us to embark upon the path
of cultivation. Only then did an era of cultivation arise within our
planet, allowing our people to finally have the power to fight back
against the outlander demons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord immediately understood. This person who had descended upon
this world from the ‘outlands’ was most likely a cultivator of
the Endless Territories who had come here, just as they had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After a very long
period of time passed, the second Prophet descended upon our world.
He was the one we call our ‘Sacred Ancestor’! He created the nine
celestial barriers, making it difficult for outlander demons to
descend upon our world. Eventually, he succeeded in his Daomerge and
then established this underground palace, giving us a place for us to
pass legacies down from generation to generation and ensuring that we
would be able to grow and thrive even more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third Prophet to
descend brought a great disaster upon us. He forced us to fight him,
and although we were able to kill him, we suffered horrendous
casualties.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophets.” Daolord
Inkmind looked at Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord. “I’m telling
you nothing but the truth. We are filled with gratitude towards the
Prophets of the outlands. Without you Prophets having descended upon
our world, we would still be living brutish and miserable lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord exchanged a glance. Both could tell that part of the reason
this person had so ‘honestly’ told them the true history of their
world was to display friendship, but the other part was to give them
a veiled warning: We don’t want to fight you, but if you force us
to then we’ll be able to wipe you out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine the first
three Prophets had their own reasons for descending upon this
planet,” the Ninedust Sectlord said in a low voice. Although both
him and Ning were quite cautious, neither of them were afraid. Both
had valuable treasures they could use, and it wouldn’t be easy for
the locals of this planet to deal with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps the
ancestral lands?” Daolord Inkmind suddenly said. The faces of both
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you really are
here to visit the ancestral lands.” Daolord Inkmind waved his hand,
causing a layer of blurry light to surround Skywind and Su Youji,
blocking them off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some
secrets which I cannot let them know,” Daolord Inkmind said.
“Please do not be offended.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning glanced
at Skywind and Su Youji, then nodded. The barrier of Immortal energy
was preventing the two from seeing what was happening on the other
side, but they just waited there obediently instead of disrupting the
power around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various
generations of Prophets all came for the sake of the ancestral
lands.” Daolord Inkmind waved his hand, producing a snow-white
scroll. “Before the Sacred Ancestor departed, he left this with us.
He instructed us to hand it over to any future Prophets and to let
them read what he wrote within it, and that it would explain
everything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord immediately turned to stare at the white scroll. The scroll
emanated an aura which was very weak but which had the essence of
eternity within it. Time no longer held any sway over this scroll at
all; without any question, this came from an Eternal Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please take a look
for yourselves.” Daolord Inkmind waved his hand, sending the white
scroll before the two of them. It automatically unfurled on its own.
The scroll was filled with many words, and both Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord stared intently at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sacred Ancestor was
an Ancient cultivator known as Emperor Vulturas. He had also been
teleported into the endless stone passageways by that spacetime
array. Pursued by countless flaming creatures, he had fled until he
finally reached this planet. This planet, however, was not the actual
site of the ancestral lands! It did, however, contain a treasure that
negated the powers of those flaming cratures, a treasure known as the
‘worldsplitter’ stone. The worldsplitter stone could be carried
or affixed to the surface of a magic treasure, and it could be used
to permanently kill those flaming creatures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why this
planet was resistant to the flaming beasts was the worldsplitter
stone, making it the most important treasure the planet had to offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it was Patriarch
Vulturas!” The Ninedust Sectlord revealed an excited look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Vulturas?”
Ning’s face changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endless
Territories, the three figures who stood at the very apex of power
were without a doubt the three Hegemons! Below them, however, was a
host of incredibly powerful Eternal Emperors. They might not be a
match for the Hegemons in power, but some were strong enough that not
even the Hegemons could slay them! Everyone had their own ‘Dao’,
after all. By relying on the area they were strong in, they were able
to escape even from Hegemons. But of course, if they were somehow
restrained there would be nothing they could do. They were some of
the most truly dominating figures of the Endless Territories, and
they included the lords of the eight Sacred Cities of the Dao
Alliance! The Aeonians, the Aberrants, the Ancient cultivators…
they all held similarly powerful figures within their ranks, and
there were some who had gone into seclusion who were even more
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Vulturas was on
the same level as the lords of the eight Sacred Cites. Amongst the
Ancient cultivators, he was a person who was viewed as being second
only to the Hegemons in power! According to the stories, he was a
merciful and kind man. A person could pretend to be kind and virtuous
for a period of time, but Emperor Vulturas had been alive for as long
as the Brightshore Kingdom had been in existence. There was no way
someone could feign virtue for that long. As a result, Emperor
Vulturas had an extremely good reputation and was idolized by
countless cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
imagined that even in a strange place like this, he would do so many
things for the local cultivators.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh in
praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that Patriarch Vulturas would’ve come to this place, and
that he actually achieved his Daomerge here. How ancient is this
ancestral site? Can it be the legendary…” When the Ninedust
Sectlord thought of one of the Ancient legends, his eyes instantly
lit up. He immediately asked, “So you are saying that by retrieving
a worldsplitter stone, we’ll be able to leave this world, right?
Quick, tell me where they are!”

Chapter 24 – Underground Tombstones
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Worldsplitter stones
are born from the very heart of this planet. They naturally are even
deeper underground than we currently are.” Daolord Inkmind looked
towards Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord. “Do the two of you wish
to go now? Would you like to take a stroll around our underground
palace and rest a bit first?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” The
Ninedust Sectlord rejected the offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the place
where Patriarch Vulturas completed his Daomerge. However, the
Ninedust Sectlord was an Ancient cultivator and thus knew very well
that Patriarch Vulturas had seventy-two Ancient cultivator disciples.
Although he was a very kind and beneficent man, he never casually
transmitted the most powerful techniques he had developed to
outsiders. At most, he’d transmit some of the second-class
techniques he possessed… but the Ninedust Sectlord truly had no
interest in those.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just judging from the
fact that Patriarch Vulturas completed his Daomerge here but was
merely the second Prophet was proof that this ‘ancestral site’
was undoubtedly a terrifyingly ancient place. Most likely, it had
something to do with some of the oldest legends of the Ancient
cultivators. He could hardly wait to find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just go down
and take a look,” Ning said. He could tell that this so-called
‘sacred ground’ was still rather wary of them. Given the
situation, it was best to keep a bit of distance between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that is your
decision, then I’ll lead the two of you down.” Daolord Inkmind
waved his hand, dispelling his Immortal energy and allowing Su Youji
and Skywind to see and hear what was going on once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind.” Daolord
Inkmind’s gaze turned towards young master Skywind. “Since you
are the Prophet’s disciple, you are naturally permitted to go
deeper underground as well. However, you had best not divulge
anything you see or hear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” young
master Skywind said hurriedly. His heart was blazing with eagerness
when he thought of how he was about to learn some of the deepest
secrets of his homeland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
Daolord Inkmind led the way, with Ning and the others following from
behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. They moved
through the twists and turns of an ordinary-looking corridor within
the palace, quickly arriving at an unfathomably deep downwards
tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately flew
down towards the tunnel, with Ning bringing Skywind with him. Skywind
certainly didn’t have the ability necessary to oppose the Emperor’s
edict! They flew deeper and deeper into the abyss, flying more than
three hundred million kilometers before finally landing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So beautiful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply marvelous.”
Ning and the others all stared at what appeared before them. This
enormous cavern was filled with all types of colors and sights. The
stone walls gleamed like gemstones, with some being fiery red and
others being jade green or deep blue. They all emanated faint ripples
of power, and as the different types of ripples coursed through them
they all felt their souls at peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll be there in
a short while.” Daolord Inkmind guided the way deftly up ahead,
moving tens of thousands of kilometers with each step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning, the Ninedust Sectlord, Su Youji, and Skywind all stared at what
was before them in astonishment. This enormous cavern was filled with
tombstones! There had to be more than ten thousand of the things, and
they stretched off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Inkmind pointed
up ahead towards the end of the cave, an area which was filled with
blurry streaks of rainbow light. Vague humanoid silhouettes could be
seen there. “There are flame demons outside. Countless earth devils
live at the core of our planet as well, and they are just as powerful
as the flame demons. However, because their natural habitat is the
center of our planet, they aren’t weakened by our formations in the
slightest. If you want worldsplitter stones, you’ll have to find
them yourselves. You’ll have to slaughter a path through the earth
devils, find the worldsplitter stones, then escape safely. If you
aren’t able to escape, then we’ll erect a tomb for you here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Inkmind pointed
towards the many tombstones, then said in a soft voice, “These
belong to many of our ancestors and built up over the course of
countless years. Many came here seeking worldsplitter stones but
ended up perishing. We weren’t even able to recover their bodies,
so we left behind tombstones for them here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You spoke of earth
devils?” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord both frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How tough are they?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tougher and stronger
than the flame demons from the outlands,” Daolord Inkmind said.
“Based on the experience we accumulated… although they are less
nimble and agile than the flame demons, they are even tougher to deal
with. Amongst my people, only Daolods of the Fourth Step are
permitted to enter the depths of this abyss in search of
worldsplitter stones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You saw it
yourselves.” Daolord Inkmind gestured at the tombstones. “All
these tombs? They each represent the death of a Daolord of the Fourth
Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them were
Daolords of the Fourth Step?” Skywind, at the very back of the
procession, couldn’t help but feel shocked. Daolords of the Fourth
Step were incredibly rare; how was it that his homeland had produced
over ten thousand of them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many Daolords
has this world given birth to?” Ning was astonished. “How could
so many of them have died here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that the Twelve Palaces of the Brightshore Kingdom had produced less
than a hundred thousand Daolords in total despite the passage of so
many years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninedust
Sectlord said calmly, “Darknorth, no need to be so surprised.
Didn’t you hear what he said? Patriarch Vulturas himself completed
his Daomerge here, but he was merely the second Prophet to descend!
Patriarch Vulturas completed his Daomerge countless ages ago, which
meant that this planet has existed for far longer than the Aeonian
race or even the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honestly, we don’t
have that many Daolords. In each era, we only see twenty or thirty of
them,” Daolord Inkmind said. “The total number is high only
because of how long we’ve been around for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
amazed. The Ancient cultivators truly were the most ancient
civilization of them all. The history of this ancestral site ran
farther back than the history of the entire Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, this
planet of ours is too small. The various generations of Daolords all
dream of visiting the outside world, and so they’ve all delved into
the underground to seek the worldsplitter stones. When each finds
one, that person is able to leave this world and visit the vaster
world outside.” Daolord Inkmind said softly, “Even though the
underground is dangerous and many have perished, successive
generations of Daolords have continued on their quest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord both nodded slightly. All Daolords had incredibly determined
Dao-hearts. This was true even for vile and demonic figures. If they
wished to leave this place, no level of danger could stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that in the Endless Territories, the Verge-level Daolords would often
venture into the Terror Starsea. Daolord Solesky had entered the
incredibly dangerous Waveshift Realm, which had been left behind by
Eternal Emperor Waveshift, the number one expert of the Dao of
Numerancy. You could imagine how deadly it was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how much time
has passed… although it might be difficult for this world of yours
to give birth to an Eternal Emperor, I imagine it must’ve given
birth to many Daolords of incredible power. I imagine some of them
must have been able to acquire worldsplitter stones. Why didn’t
they take out more? That way, there would be no need for the others
to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we have indeed
given birth to a number of incredible Daolords.” Daolord Inkmind
said coldly, “However… the outlands are filled with endless flame
demons and many other unknown creatures. If you don’t have the
courage to venture underground to find worldsplitter stones for
yourself, what right do you have to go to the outlands?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a tradition
of my homeland. If you wish to leave, you must find a worldsplitter
stone for yourself first. Only then can you leave.” Daolord Inkmind
said calmly, “Over the course of so many years, more than ten
thousand Daolords have successfully acquired worldsplitter stones and
left for the outlands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly said, “Have any of the Daolords who left ever been able to
return?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Inkmind shook
his head. “None!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord felt stunned. Not a single one out of all those Daolords
returned?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps they were
unable to find a way to contact us after they reached the vaster
world outside,” Daolord Inkmind said. Ning and the others nodded.
This was indeed quite possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They might’ve died,
but they also might’ve survived but left this spacetime continuum.
For example, in this region Ning and the others were unable to
maintain contact with the outside world. Those who successfully left
this region and entered the Endless territories. would probably also
be unable to maintain contact with the ‘sacred grounds’ here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though the
outlands might hold great danger, our Daolords have always wanted to
give it a try. All of us are filled with curiosity towards the
outlands,” Daolord Inkmind said. “Even if they aren’t able to
come back, it doesn’t really matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Ninedust
Sectlord pointed towards the rainbow-lit region at the end of the
cavern. “So if we want worldsplitter stones, we should just charge
straight inside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Daolord
Inkmind shook his head as he stared at the rainbow region and the
humanoid silhouettes within it. “I imagine you can see those earth
devils yourself. Even from here, I can see more than three thousand
of them! Based on the accumulated experiences of our Daolords, the
earth devils like to drift about. Sometimes, the number of earth
devils in a region will be lower than usual. If you can see less than
five hundred from this position, that means they are now fairly
dispersed. But of course, even then you’ll definitely encounter
more than five hundred when you venture forth, as I’m merely
talking about the ones visible from here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can see less
than a hundred, things will be even safer,” Daolord Inkmind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred? And
usually how long does that take?” The Ninedust Sectlord was rather
impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
this will happen once per chaos cycle,” Daolord Inkmind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s far too
long.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “Lower than five
hundred?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roughly once every
million years,” Daolord Inkmind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still too long.”
The Ninedust Sectlord truly wanted to charge in right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you only want to
wait for lower than a thousand, ten thousand years should be enough,”
Daolord Inkmind said. “But a thousand… that’ll be extremely
dangerous. Only the most powerful of Daolords would have a chance of
success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
turned to look at Ning. “Ten thousand years. That’s doable. What
do you think, Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I don’t
want to wait too long either. When we can see less than a thousand
earth devils, we’ll enter.” Ning had only been training for a
short period of time, while the Ninedust Sectlord was filled with
eagerness towards the legacy of the Ancient cultivators. As a result,
neither wished to tarry here too long. They had spent months
surviving in the ‘outlands’; they were quite confident in their
abilities to acquire the worldsplitter stones.

Chapter 25 – Skywind’s Life
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sacred grounds
will send people to keep an eye on this place,” Daolord Inkmind
said with a smile. “You can come with me to visit the underground
palace, or you can wander around our planet and explore it a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” The
Ninedust Sectlord said calmly, “I’ll wait right here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, there’s no
need to trouble anyone. The two of us can simply wait here,” Ji
Ning agreed. He then looked at the nearby Skywind. “Skywind, you
can go out and engage in some exploration and adventuring. If you
have any questions regarding the Dao of the Sword, you may come speak
to me about them. After I acquire the worldsplitter stone, I’ll
leave this planet. By then, you’ll have to rely on yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind said
respectfully, “Yes, Master. In truth, in the last few days since
you transmitted the Dao of the Sword to me, I’ve gained many
insights and am prepared to enter the World level already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind.” The
nearby Daolord Inkmind smiled. “The sacred grounds have quite a few
World-level cultivators. They are the disciples and servants of the
various Daolords here. After you make your breakthrough, you can spar
with them. You can also go and study from the various Sword Daos
which the successive generations of our Daolords have left behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Skywind revealed an excited look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ning nodded
in approval. “Disciple, this is a wonderful opportunity for you.
Don’t let it slip past you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord spent the rest of their time quietly meditating underground,
waiting for the right moment. The Ninedust Sectlord simply sat on the
ground, while Ning used his temporal acceleration cottage. The
sectlord was at a bottleneck and needed an epiphany to break through.
Ning, in contrast, had just recently become a Daolord of the Second
Step. He needed to seize every moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very year, Skywind
broke through to become a World-level cultivator. In the past, he had
never had a good teacher; he had relied completely on his own natural
talents to cultivate himself. Things were different, now that he had
Ning’s guidance. Ning was a perfect teacher for him, with the five
sword-arts Ning having transmitted being perfect guides as to five
different directions the Dao of the Sword could be developed towards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every ten years or so,
he would come and ask Ning a question. He would also often leave the
underground region to go to the sacred grounds and spar against the
other World-level cultivators there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s improving at
a terrifying rate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who the hell is this
kid? I’ve never seen him here before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His name is Skywind.
I hear that he’s the disciple of one of the Prophets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Prophet? No wonder
he’s this impressive. I heard that all Prophets are incredibly
strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Sword Dao is
simply incredible. I’ve never seen any World-level cultivator
improve this quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to Ning’s
temporal acceleration treasure, Skywind truly did improve remarkably
fast. Three thousand years later, he had become a master-class World
God… but of course, he had actually spent nearly three hundred
thousand accelerated years within the spacetime treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder the
Prophet took a liking to him.” The Grand Elder’s avatar stared at
Skywind from afar as the latter sparred with another opponent. The
avatar nodded. “His talent for sword-arts truly is impressive.
Inkmind, on my orders all of the Sword Dao legacies within the sacred
grounds are to be made available to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?! B-but Grand
Elder…” Daolord Inkmind was rather startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind is a member
of our race,” the Grand Elder said with a smile. And so, Skywind
began to gain access to some peerless sword-arts legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, your
disciple has some questions to ask.” Every ten years, Skywind would
come and ask Ning some questions. Each time, Ning would guide him
through his queries and even personally spar with him to help him
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, Ning
had spent far more time with Skywind than his other two disciples,
Bluecliff Xiaoyu and Green Bamboo. Although Ning’s Primaltwin and
Xiaoyu often met in the Three Realms, Xiaoyu was different from Ning;
she wasn’t the type of person who was completely enthralled by
cultivation. In contrast, Green Bamboo and Skywind were true
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, your
disciple has studied many of the sword-arts of the sacred grounds.
Each time, you were able to easily point out the various flaws within
them.” Skywind was puzzled. “Should I stop learning these
sword-arts?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five sword-arts
I taught you represent five different avenues for developing the Dao
of the Sword. All the sword-arts in the universe are unable to escape
the reach of these five avenues.” Ning chuckled. “The more you
study, the more it will benefit your mastery over my five
sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Skywind was
enlightened. In truth, the more sword-arts he studied, the more
amazed he was by his master. Over the course of countless chaos
cycles, the sacred grounds had produced quite a few Daolords of the
Dao of the Sword. However, whenever he compared their sword-arts to
his master’s sword-arts, especially his master’s Omega Sword Dao
sword-intent, he always felt that they were much inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind was beginning
to understand just how terrifyingly powerful his master truly was!
The sacred grounds had built up an enormous collection of sword-arts,
yet not a single one of them appeared to be a match for his master’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have spent five
thousand years under my tutelage, and your sword-arts are comparable
to that of supreme World Gods. Further instruction will be of limited
use to you. What you should do is go meditate and find a Dao which
suits you the most, a Dao which you shall use to become a Samsara
Daolord,” Ning said. “You can leave now. Go. Explore. Adventure.
Here in the sacred grounds, you’ll never have a chance to truly
temper yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Skywind said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He left the underground
world, returning to the beautiful world outside. He resolved the
enmities and feuds he had, then went out to adventure through the
world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind slowly began to
grow and mature. After two thousand years of adventuring, he
possessed the power of a transcendent World God even though he didn’t
have any particularly powerful treasures! By now, he was ready to
break through to become a Samsara Daolord whenever he wished.
However, he did not break through because he kept on having the
feeling that the Daos he had developed were not what he was truly
searching for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master’s five
sword-arts all surpassed everything he was able to come up with. As
for the Omega Sword Dao’s sword-intent, it was unimaginably
superior. And so Skywind continued to search… search for a Dao he
would be satisfied with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sacred grounds kept
a quiet watch on him as well. When they realized he already had the
power to become a Samsara Daolord whenever he wished, they showed
themselves and began to help him when necessary. Skywind’s status
in the sacred grounds quickly skyrocketed, and he was viewed as
Samsara Daolords were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Skywind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s World God
Skywind. He’s already come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Skywind returned
to the sacred grounds, he attracted the attention of many of the
Elder Gods, Ancestral Immortals, and World-level cultivators here.
The news that he was capable of becoming a Samsara Daolord whenever
he wished had long ago been leaked to everyone; this was to ensure
that no one would grumble or complain about the special status he had
within the sacred grounds. In this planet, the sacred grounds held an
overwhelming level of power over the rest of the world. There was no
fear that anyone might attempt to harm him out of jealousy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, World God
Skywind is nothing more than a World God. Why is everyone so
excited?” A violet-robed woman quietly asked her master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This woman was
Violetlotus. Fairy Violetlotus was an extremely capable woman, and
she was capable of doing anything to achieve her goals. After she
learned of the existence of the ‘sacred grounds’, she came up
with a way to become a member of a Samsara Daolord’s school! Later
on, she managed to acquire one of just ten slots for cultivators to
be sent into the sacred grounds and become one of them. She had never
expected that Skywind had already become a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, disciple… you
don’t know this yet, but Skywind is no ordinary World God. The
sacred grounds have many World Gods, but Skywind is the disciple of a
Prophet. He is also incredibly powerful, and he has reached such
heights in the Dao of the Sword that he can become a Samsara Daolord
whenever he chooses.” Her master’s eyes glowed with excitement.
“Do you know? The speed at which he became a World God and reached
such heights of power is only equaled by some of the most legendary
Daolords in the history of the sacred grounds. Given his current
level of insight and the fact that he still refuses to make a
breakthrough, he clearly wishes to develop an even more powerful Dao
for himself and become an absolutely dominating Daolord. I’d be
more than willing to become the retainer to a figure like him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Violetlotus was
speechless. A complex look appeared on her face as she stared at the
distant Skywind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Skywind had
seen her as well, but he had only given her a glance and then
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind…” Fairy
Violetlotus watched silently as he left. Although she had repeatedly
caused trouble for him and had actually tortured him, she also felt
certain strange, mixed emotions towards him. If it wasn’t for that,
she would’ve killed him long ago when he was very weak. The reason
why she had tortured him but not killed him was due to the
contradictory feelings she had in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He just glanced at
me, then ignored me? I wouldn’t have cared if he came over to take
revenge on me and kill me, but he didn’t even glance a second time
at me.” Fairy Violetlotus continued to stare silently, her
fingernails digging deep into her palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very pleased
that his disciple Skywind was searching for a suitable Dao for
himself. However, he wasn’t really able to help out; it would all
be up to Skywind himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself had only
been able to join together his five Supreme Daos when he was within
the Genesis Lands of the alternate universe. Finally, after reviving
his parents in the Three Realms, his heart became peaceful and he was
able to break through to master his Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This disciple of his
would have his own path to tread. Even if his disciple also embarked
on the path of the Omega Sword Dao, every single cultivator’s Dao
would be different and unique in certain ways. There was no way any
Samsara Daolord could completely imitate or train in the Dao of
another; only the Dao they themselves created would be ideal for
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, our
chance has come,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning rose to
his feet and walked out of his temporal acceleration cottage. They
had waited here for twelve thousand years; it was now finally time
for them to go retrieve the worldsplitter stones.
</P>

Chapter 26 – The Battle in the World’s Core
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prophet.” Daolord
Inkmind’s true body had been here this entire time, attending to
their needs. Upon seeing Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord halt their
cultivation, he hurriedly spoke out to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Inkmind.” Ning smiled. “The time has now come for me and Ninedust
to enter this place and search for worldsplitter stones. Sorry for
making you go to the trouble of watching over us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was no trouble at
all. Are the two of you truly unwilling to wait any longer?”
Daolord Inkmind couldn’t help but try to dissuade them: “If you
want a few hundred thousand years, the density of the earth devils
might drop by a half, and the danger will drop to roughly 10% of what
it is right now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
said calmly, “No need to wait any further. Darknorth, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
and Ning simultaneously transformed into streaks of light, flying
towards that enormous rainbow-lit region that led deeper underground.
There were a number of those humanoid figures flying through that
rainbow region. Each of them had tall, muscular bodies, wore black
armor, and had faces that were dark yellow in color. They looked like
towering mountains, and they emanated an aura of the world’s
ponderance. This was a type of strange creature that possessed the
power of the vast earth itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were different
from the flame demons. The flame demons were more violent and had
more powerful attacks, while the earth devils always stayed within
their own domain without proactively leaving to launch attacks on the
world at large. However, anyone who dared to trespass into their
homeland would suffer their merciless reprisals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As Ning and
the Ninedust Sectlord flew into the home of the earth devils, the
creatures suddenly turned alert. Moments ago, they had been quite
relaxed; now, they all turned to glare towards the two intruders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate the
intruders!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Virtually all the earth
devils in the area began to move in unison, transforming into streaks
of light that shot towards the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t waste any
time.. Let’s shake them off as soon as possible,” the Ninedust
Sectlord suggested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” As soon
as the two entered, they had both sensed the dense and heavy earth
energy which permeated this entire region and which applied enormous
pressure to them. However, both were able to resist the pressure with
ease! They also saw that there were many different stone passageways
that led from this region to other places. The core of the world
seemed almost like a spiderweb lattice of tunnels with countless
short passageways that could be taken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The passageways were so
short that there was no way Ning could rely on his black vessel to
flee. In this place, it wasn’t speed which mattered; it was
agility! The countless short tunnels forced them to repeatedly change
directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning didn’t
hesitate at all, immediately unleashing his nine novessence arts and
letting them crush outwards towards the encroaching earth devils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We Ancient
cultivators also have certain secret arts of tremendous power, but
the more powerful they are the harder it is to cultivate them.” The
Ninedust Sectlord couldn’t help but feel a bit jealous when he saw
Ning use the nine novessence arts. Both the Dao Alliance and the
Ancient cultivators had many secret arts of incredible power. As for
the terrifying secret arts Ning had acquired from the deceased Sword
Hegemon, they were far more powerful than these nine novessence arts.
However, the more powerful a secret art was, the higher its
requirements were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These secret arts would
all require incredibly rare and valuable magic treasures which were
almost never sold to outsiders. The bloodfruit which Ning had
acquired was a good example; there was no way Skywood City would ever
sell sacred bloodfruit. After slaying Daolord Kongsan, Ning had
become much wealthier than he had been… but alas, he hadn’t been
able to use that wealth to purchase any of the rare treasures he
needed to train in the Hegemon’s secret art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just gaining a basic
level of skill in the Hegemon’s secret art required three
exceedingly valuable treasures. To master it, twelve were needed.
Thus far, Ning hadn’t found even one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
the Ninedust Sectlord. Although he had been alive for far longer than
Ning had and knew more secret arts, he hadn’t been able to master
even one secret art of tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Daolord
Allgod’s nine novesence arts didn’t rely that much on rare
treasures; Dao lightning and Dao water were fairly weak and cheap.
The true ingenuity of the nine arts lay in the way Daolord Allgod had
mixed them together in an alchemical fashion, allowing him to
perfectly control the [Novessence Thunder] and the [Novessence
Water]. This was a type of secret art which possessed tremendous
power while having fairly low material requirements… but actually
training in it was incredibly difficult. Not only did it require one
to be fairly proficient in those nine different types of Dao, it also
required you to have reached the grandmaster level in alchemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
manifested three heads and six arms, taking his six Northbow swords
into his hands. He seemed to completely transform into a black hole,
making it very difficult for the attacking earth devils to do
anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
sliced through the chest of one of the earth devils. Moments later,
the earth devil’s body suddenly exploded with a giant boom. The
shattered bits of its body were quickly ground into dust by the power
of the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, your
sword-arts have actually improved.” The distant Ninedust Sectlord
still had the presence of mind to jest with Ning. This was mainly
because they had been through far more dangerous situations when they
had been fighting against the countless flame demons in the outlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a little bit,”
Ning said. Ning had used his temporal acceleration treasure for the
past twelve thousand years, which he had spent almost exclusively in
cultivation. However, aside from the Blood Drop sword-intent which he
had broken through in quite some time ago, his other four types of
sword-intent hadn’t improved in the slightest. As a result, he
wasn’t much stronger than he had been in the past, even though his
Omega Sword Dao – Blood Drop was now twice as powerful as before.
If he wanted to improve overall, he would need for all five
sword-intents to make breakthroughs, then merge together into his
third-stage Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
earth devils utilized heavy weapons like greataxes, warhammers, and
heavy poles. They struck out with brutish power, and although Ning
held the upper hand he still found each clash quite difficult to
endure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After getting a basic
understanding of how the earth devils fought, the two felt their
hearts grow heavy. They were able to temporarily destroy the earth
devils, but just like the flame demons they had unkillable forms!
Fighting them head-on would severely slow down the two cultivators,
and these creatures were even more dangerous than the flame demons
when massed together. Fortunately, they were comparatively fewer in
number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The two used
agility techniques to flee while blocking, and they quickly darted
through the countless web-like tunnels. Both of them were faster than
the flame demons, and so they were significantly faster than the
slower earth devils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” As they
continued to flee, more earth devils were attracted by the sounds of
combat and came charging straight towards them. Each time, the two
cultivators had no choice but to end the battle as soon as possible
as they delved deeper and deeper into the earth’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were very
experienced and very powerful, and they were working in concert. They
were able to ‘wander’ through the underground lattice of tunnels
for roughly an hour with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over there.” Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord immediately saw the slick black stone that
was hovering in the air off in the distance. It looked extremely
smooth and glossy, and seemed to be filled with endless power, almost
as though it held an entire massive world within it. Although this
was the first time they had seen this stone, they immediately
recognized it as a worldsplitter stone based on the descriptions
Daolord Inkmind had given them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A worldsplitter
stone.” The Ninedust Sectlord was closer to it, and so he
immediately waved his arm to collect it. He then grinned at Ning.
“I’ll hold onto this one for now. Let’s keep exploring until we
find a second one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning didn’t
really mind. The two had sworn lifeblood oaths long ago and thus both
trusted each other quite a bit by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The worldsplitter
stones had been birthed from the core of this planet. Although some
could be found hovering around in outer regions like this place, most
were located far deeper and closer to the heart of the world. Thus,
the farther down they went the better their chances would be… but
the more dangerous it would be as well, of course. It would also be a
longer way back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More time passed. Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord continued to battle and charge their way
closer and closer to the planet’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…” Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord’s faces both turned pale. Off in the
distance, they saw streaks of light flying about happily. There were
a total of four streaks, and they each possessed strange vitality and
life energy. All four were of different colors, and their auras were
completely different as well. However, they flew together in unison
and ‘chased’ after each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four of the five
types of Dragonfish Ki?” Ning immediately recognized recognized
those four streaks of light. They were incredibly famous treasures
that were absolutely priceless, far more valuable than Dao lightning
or Dao water. They were incredibly rare and simply couldn’t be
bought on any market. Even if a major power was lucky enough to
encounter them, he’d generally only trade it for other treasures of
similar value rather than sell them. A single stream of Dragonfish Ki
would be worth roughly eighty million cubes of chaos nectar; these
things were even more valuable than sacred bloodfruit! One could
imagine how rare they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I only
need one of those four.” The Ninedust Sectlord was so excited his
entire body was shaking. If he acquired the Dragonfish Ki, then even
if he found nothing else from this ancestral site he would still be
completely satisfied. “This thing is extremely important to me.
Brother Darknorth, please assist me. I can promise that the other
three will be yours.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_27___The_Core"></A>
Chapter 27 – The Core
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which one do you
want?” Ji Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The water-attribute
Dragonfish Ki.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning. Although the
two were working together, they were equal partners; the Ninedust
Sectlord didn’t have the right to unilaterally choose which
treasures he wanted. If Ning also deeply desired the water-attribute
Dragonfish Ki, then it would end up going to whoever moved the
fastest. The Ninedust Sectlord truly wasn’t confident in his
chances, as the power of Ning’s nine novessence arts was truly
great; if Ning was to apply all nine of them in chasing after
treasures, his chances would probably be greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To tell you the
truth, I truly wish to acquire the water-attribute Dragonfish Ki as
well.” Ning grinned when he saw the worried look on the Ninedust
Sectlord’s face. “But… even if I did get it, it wouldn’t be
of much use to me for now. Fine, fine; the water-attribute one is
yours, but the other three are mine. I suppose I technically come out
slightly ahead in this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a sigh of relief. Sometimes, quantity
wasn’t the most important thing when it came to procuring
treasures, nor was the superficial ‘market price’. When you
encountered a precious treasure that you were in desperate need of,
you would easily be willing to pay five to ten times the ‘normal’
price! The real question was, how badly did you need it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let the
Dragonfish Ki escape.” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord instantly
began to make their moves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five types of
Dragonfish Ki were aligned to the Five Elements, and four of those
five types were before them – metal, wood, water, and fire. Ning’s
greatest strength lay in his Sword Dao, with water and thunder in
second position. Thus, Ning really did care more about the
water-attribute Dragonfish Ki. However, even if he acquired it he
would simply store it away for now, because he didn’t really need
it for training in any secret arts at present. Perhaps in the future
he would obtain a secret art which required such a treasure, but
Ning’s focus was on the deceased Sword Hegemon’s secret art. That
was a truly powerful secret art! It was quite unlikely that he’d be
able to obtain anything more powerful than it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the two of them
fought through more than ten earth devils and acquired the four types
of Dragonfish Ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” The
Ninedust Sectlord roared with laughter. “Finally, I’ll be able to
make yet another breakthrough in my secret art. The water-attribute
Dragonfish Ki… I once offered a bounty of three hundred million
cubes of chaos nectar for it, but no one was willing to accept it.
Daolord Curveclaw of the Aberrants actually offered it to me for one
billion! I was so angry I really wanted to just kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures like these
can only be hoped for, not counted on.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Darknorth. Haha, you know? I’m starting to take a liking to you.”
The Ninedust Sectlord laughed merrily. “After we leave this
ancestral site, if there’s anything you need me to do I’ll do it,
so long as it isn’t anything suicidal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately felt
much more friendly towards the Ninedust Sectlord. Ninedust was the
type of person who would do anything to achieve his goals, but he
wasn’t truly an evil man. The Ninedust Sect’s evil reputation was
primarily due to the evil deeds of the previous sectlord. The current
Ninedust Sectlord was an Ancient cultivator and thus rather arrogant
and aloof, and he was willing to do anything for the sake of his
cultivation, but he would remember even the slightest of kindnesses
or debts that he owed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s
anything you need me to do I’ll do it, so long as it isn’t
suicidal.” This was quite a promise. The term ‘suicidal’
referred to something like Ning asking him to help Ning kill a
Hegemon – that would be suicide! But if Ning said to him, “Come,
let us venture into the Terror Starsea?” The Ninedust Sectlord
would fearlessly accompany Ning into it, despite the many dangers
involved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result of this
minor affair, both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord became much more
well-disposed towards each other. This often happened when Daolords
adventured together. The term ‘lifelong friend’ often came as a
result of friendships being forged through shared adversity in
life-and-death situations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t we
been able to find a second worldsplitter stone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve spent
another full hour in here.” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord
continued to go deeper and deeper into the planet, and the countless
passageways continuously twisted downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had taken
many twists and turns, both of them knew exactly where they were.
They knew that they were moving closer to the core of the planet.
Surprisingly enough, they didn’t encounter all that many earth
devils on the way over; in fact, the closer they were to the core,
the fewer in number the devils seemed to become.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A worldsplitter
stone.” They saw a levitating worldsplitter stone off in the
distance. Ning instantly revealed a look of delight. They were now
very deep inside the planet, but there were no earth devils nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning
immediately flew over and reached out, grabbing the worldsplitter
stone with his hands. Moments later, he stared in front of him in
surprise. The Ninedust Sectlord was right behind him, and he also
stared in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right in front of them
was an enormous globe that was pitch-black in color which emanated
minute ripples of power. Ning, however, could just barely sense that
these ripples were so powerful as to cause their hearts to quaver.
Them listening to these ripples was like a pair of ants listening to
the heartbeat of an enormous dragon; the terror they felt was innate
and heartfelt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This must be the
core of the planet,” the Ninedust Sectlord said softly. “This is
the core of this entire world. It gave birth to all the earth devils,
and also to the worldsplitter stones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the Dragonfish
Ki.” Ning pointed off into the distance. The Ninedust Sectlord
followed Ning’s gaze, only to see that there were four types of
infant Dragonfish Ki being nurtured upon the outermost surface of the
world’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. This isn’t
a place for us to do as we please.” The Ninedust Sectlord didn’t
have the slightest intention of trying to take away the core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When adventuring, if
you wanted to live a long life you had to know your limits. This
planet was capable of suppressing the countless flame demons of the
outlands, ensuring that they didn’t dare to enter. A ripple from
its core alone was enough to inspire fear in their hearts. The power
of this planetary core vastly surpassed that of an ordinary Eternal
Emperor. Both of them had the feeling that if they so much as touched
the core, they would probably be instantly reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. They
quickly departed. On the way back, they encountered a number of earth
devils but were able to quickly shake them off. Although the battles
seemed fierce, in truth both were still distracted by thoughts of
that enormous, pitch-black world core. What an utterly terrifying
core that was! Ning estimated that only someone with the power of a
Hegemon would have a chance at possibly procuring it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder the living
beings born on this planet all have such incredible talent for
cultivation and are able to train so easily. This world is even
smaller than the Three Realms, but in this era alone it has already
given birth to twenty or thirty Daolords and a terrifying number of
World-level cultivators. No wonder.” Ning secretly sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Elder’s
avatar led a group of sixteen Daolords as they waited next to the
tombstones. They stared afar at the rainbow region off in the
distance which led to the world’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder, the two
Prophets have been in there for too long. Is it possible that they…”
A Daolord spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been quite
long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Daolords rarely
spent that much time in there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, if
one wasn’t able to acquire a worldsplitter stone in a fairly short
period of time, one would quickly retreat and wait for another
opportunity in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prophets won’t
die that easily,” the Grand Elder said. “Wait a while longer.
They should be returning soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later. “There they are,” Daolord Inkmind said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swosh! Two
streaks of light quickly flew towards them from afar, pursued by a
large number of earth devils. Ning’s nine novessence arts swirled
around him like nine dragons. With the Ninedust Sectlord’s help,
they managed to quickly throw off the pursuit of the earth devils.
Even the most rare and powerful of earth devils were merely on par
with the two of them, and even then they weren’t as fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. They
flew out of the rainbow region, then landed at the entrance of the
cave. They watched calmly as the many earth devils within the region
issued threatening growls to the two of them. Slowly, the earth
devils turned their attention away. So long as one retreated from
their home, the creatures would not pursue them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Prophets.” The Grand Elder smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to train for
a while.” The Ninedust Sectlord didn’t waste words on ceremony.
He waved his hand, causing a wooden house to descend before him. He
then entered the wooden house, which was in truth an Eternal-class
estate-treasure with incredibly strong defenses that were hard to
breach. He sent mentally to Ning, “Darknorth, I need to train in my
secret arts for a while. Two hours should be enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
turned to glance at the white-robed Grand Elder. He smiled. “Sorry
for having troubled you in recent days. Ninedust and I have both
acquired worldsplitter stones; this very day, we shall leave this
world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Elder and the
others all let out secret sighs of relief. It was best if the two
left. By now, they were no longer cultivators who need ‘Prophets’
to transmit techniques to them. They had built up an enormous
collection of skills after having embarked on the path of cultivation
countless years ago. Although they were a bit weaker than any one of
the Twelve Palaces of the Brightshore Kingdom, they weren’t that
much weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to
trouble you to watch over my disciple Skywind after our departure,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.
Skywind is a member of our sacred grounds and a member of our race.
We’ll spare no expense in helping him grow up and become stronger,”
the Grand Elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind was seated at
the desolate mountain in an area with no life at all. The only thing
in front of him was endless sand, which contained tribal lifeforms
within it. He just watched silently, his gaze travelling countless
kilometers as he watched the various individuals celebrate and
lament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still can’t let
it all go.” Skywind shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywind.” A surge
of godsense swept towards Skywind, ringing out by his ears. “Your
master, Prophet Darknorth, will be leaving our world today. He’ll
be venturing out into the outlands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is leaving?”
Young master Skywind immediately rose to his feet. He knew very well
that everything he had today, he had thanks to Ning’s guidance.
Many of the cultivators of this planet had once trained in the Dao of
the Sword, but none of them had ever reached the level his master had
reached. The information his master provided went to the core of the
Dao of the Sword, and it seemed as though there were no sword-arts
which puzzled his master. It was also thanks to his master’s
guidance that he had been able to improve so quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Skywind
transformed into a sword-shadow. Thanks to the treasures and divine
abilities he had acquired in the sacred grounds, he was already
comparable to a Daolord of the First Step. And now, he immediately
displayed his sword-arts for all to see as he quickly headed back
home.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Book 30, Ancient
Cultivator, Chapter 28 –The Shattered Planet
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast grassland. The
Grand Elder was here, leading a group of Daolords and Skywind in
bidding Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord farewell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Skywind
looked at Ning, truly unwilling to part with him. Ning had never
asked anything of him and had whole-heartedly helped him this entire
time. His father had given many costly gifts to convince Swordmaster
Eastvoid to teach him, but the Swordmaster was nothing more than a
World-level cultivator… and in the end, he hadn’t even accepted
Skywind as a disciple. Compared to Ning, Swordmaster Eastvoid was
absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Skywind, if
destiny wills it, we shall meet again in the future,” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Skywind
nodded heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
glanced at the nearby Ninedust Sectlord, who pursed his lips into a
smirk. “I didn’t take on any disciples. I can leave whenever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Skywind
and the other Daolords watched as they instantly shot into the air,
quickly charging into the gaseous barriers in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywind watched as Ning
disappeared into the distance, tears appearing in his eyes. Would he
ever have the chance to meet his master again?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master
Darknorth is very, very powerful.” The Grand Elder gently patted
Skywind on the shoulders. “Skywind, you have to grow powerful as
well if you want to catch up to him. Otherwise, how will you possibly
become strong enough to venture into the outlands and search for
him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Skywind nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord passed through the nine gaseous barriers, finally returning
to the empty region surrounding the entire planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a marvelous
place.” The Ninedust Sectlord glanced downwards. “This single,
tiny little planet has actually given birth to so many cultivators
that each era holds twenty to thirty Daolords. This single planet
holds a level of power comparable to quite a few territories
combined. It lives up to its reputation as an ancestral site of my
Ancient race.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This planet might
not necessarily be connected to your ancestors.” Ning turned to
glance towards the outside. “Pick a direction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around them
was vast and empty. Beyond this empty region were countless stone
passageways that led off in many different directions. These stone
passageways brimmed with flames; one could only imagine how many of
those flame demons were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every direction
seems to be the same. We came from this direction over there, so
let’s take the opposite route.” The Ninedust Sectlord pointed to
the other side of the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You read my mind.”
Ning grinned, then waved his hand and produced a black flying vessel.
The two immediately boarded the vessel. Swoosh! It instantly
accelerated to move at a hundred times the speed of light, departing
the planet. This entire ancestral site, including the planet they had
been in, was dimensionally locked, preventing any form of
teleportation or blinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we go.” Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord both stared towards the stone passageway as
they moved closer and closer to it. Swish! The black vessel dove into
one of the stone tunnels and into its roaring flames. When they saw a
distant flame demon, both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord instantly
used their worldsplitter stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Their
armor and their weaponry all glowed with black light, covered by the
effects of the worldsplitter stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The distant
flame demon bellowed as it charged at them while also sending out an
invisible vibration. Soon, many more flame demons appeared in the
distance and began to furiously charge towards the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, take a
look at this secret art of mine,” the Ninedust Sectlord chuckled.
His body instantly began to glow with a curtain of watery light that
looked almost solid, as though waves had appeared in the area around
him. The deep blue waves wildly smashed as the ripples spread beyond
him, crashing into the attacking flame demons. The flame demons were
all sent stumbling backwards as their speed dropped drastically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The watery curtain of
light surrounded Ning as well. Ning reached into the curtain to touch
it with his hand, and as he did he could sense a surge of
overwhelming power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
the Ninedust Sectlord asked smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is just as
powerful as my secret art,” Ning said with a praising nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. This
Ripplewater secret art of mine was created by an Eternal Emperor of
my race. I am skilled in the Dao of Water, and so I started training
in this secret art long ago. Only today have I finally mastered it.”
The Ninedust Sectlord was in quite a good mood. “I’m currently a
Daolord of the Third Step. Once I become a Daolord of the Fourth Step
and reach an even higher level of understanding, my Ripplewater art
will strengthen even further. Haha, when I fight against my peers,
I’ll start off with this secret art to slow them down. Heh, heh,
heh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you really
took to heart the way I used my secret arts to suppress you,” Ning
teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your secrets arts
pissed me the hell off.” The Ninedust Sectlord had to chuckle as
well. “Are you feeling jealous about my new breakthrough? Haha,
even if I have to go back to the Endless Territories right now I
would feel no regrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they chatted, more
and more of the slowed-down flame demons began to gather around them
and attack them. In the past, they would never have dared to let the
flame demons congregate in such large numbers. Now that they had
worldsplitter stones, they wanted to test the stones out for
themselves and so they didn’t mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if they faced more
than a hundred flame demons, they wouldn’t find it too hard to
escape even if they didn’t have a worldsplitter stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning
transformed into his three-headed, six-armed form. Six Northbow
swords were in his hands, and each one was covered with a layer of
the worldsplitter stone’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Sword-light
howled through the air and chopped straight through the flame demons,
cutting giant wounds into their bodies and stabbing gouging holes
into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!” All of the
flame demons who were stabbed through their armor let out miserable,
powerless cries. Their eyes quickly turned dull and blank as their
auras rapidly vanished. They were like snow melting in the heat of
the summer sun. Some of the flame demons had clearly suffered just
tiny wounds, but they vanished and their bodies were dispersed into
flames, never to be reborn again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They die whenever
they are so much as touched by the energy of the worldsplitter
stones?” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord were shocked by how
powerful the stones were. It seemed as though this was a natural
counter for the flame demons; so long as you were able to breach
their armor and wound them, they would invariably perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’ll make
things easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This’ll be a
hundred times simpler than I thought.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord were both delighted, and they quickly began to advance at
high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on, day by
day, as the two of them traversed one flaming stone tunnel after
another. After finding nothing, they finally opted to enter one of
the enormous stone corridors that were a million kilometers wide. In
the past, these places were mortally dangerous to them. Now that they
had worldsplitter stones, they could give them a try. These corridors
had absolutely terrifying numbers of flame demons, with each group
clustering in the thousands and some in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even supported by both
their secret arts and the worldsplitter stones, they found it
incredibly hard to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These million
kilometer tunnels are the main passageways.” Although they were
surrounded by danger and often had to fight for their lives, they
soon realized the good part of being in these massive tunnels. The
smaller tunnels turned and twisted like spiderwebs, making it
difficult to progress in any one direction. These main passageways,
however, were all linked together in straight fashion, making it so
that they didn’t have to twist and turn when trying to advance in a
certain direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. Ning helped the
Ninedust Sectlord block a chop but was sent flying as a result. As
for the Ninedust Sectlord, he took out a Dao-seal. BANG! A wild wind
suddenly erupted, blowing back countless flame demons who found that
they were completely unable to control their bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move!”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord hurriedly fled aboard their black
vessel in a rather bedraggled fashion. Although the worldsplitter
stones were banes to the flame demons, they had been surrounded and
attacked by over a hundred thousand of the creatures, forcing both of
them to go all-out and use some of their special treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The flying vessel
shot out of the enormous stone passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An empty region!
Another empty region!” Both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord were
overjoyed. Although they had merely spent twelve hours in the
super-wide passageways, they had nearly died on three occasions. Each
time, they had only survived thanks to their Dao-seals. Ning had used
one of the Dao-seals left behind by Daolord Kongsan, while Ninedust
had used up two seals of similar power. This was primarily because
Ninedust’s protective abilities weren’t as formidable as Ning’s
suit of Hegemon armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve finally
reached an empty region again.” The two stood on the prow of the
black vessel and stared off into the distance as the charging flame
demons behind them began to slow down, almost as though they were
afraid of something up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Up ahead was a stream
of rainbow light that snaked through an empty region that was over a
hundred billion kilometers in size. At the very center of this region
was the silhouette of a planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same as before?”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord exchanged a glance. When they had been
in Skywind’s homeland, they had seen something quite similar, a
planet hidden within a massive, empty void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. They sent the
vessel flying closer. The stream of light filled much of the void and
thus covered the planet, making it hard for them to get a close look
at it. By the time they were just a few hundred million kilometers
away, they were able to see everything clearly. Within the rainbow
light, they saw an utterly devastated planet that was covered with
countless ‘wounds’. Next to it levitated two enormous fragments
of another shattered planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been broken
apart?” The two stared in disbelief at the devastated planet.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 – Golden Sand
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shattered planet
still emanated an aura of exalted might, but it would never be able
to pose a threat to anyone ever again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it have
been shattered?” The Ninedust Sectlord was in disbelief. “Not
even an Eternal Emperor could’ve destroyed something like that.
Only a Hegemon would’ve been able to do it. Could a Hegemon have
come here and destroyed this planet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s land on the
surface and take a look,” Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Maybe there
are some leftover treasures,” the Ninedust Sectlord agreed. Both of
them were very curious; what type of power could’ve shattered such
a planet? It must be understood that first planet had a similar aura
of power and had twenty to third Daolords at any given point in time,
as well as a terrifying number of earth devils. There was no way such
a powerful planet could be destroyed on a whim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. The two
quickly flew closer to the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s halt here.”
The two of them simultaneously noticed the danger up ahead and issued
warnings to each other as they halted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rainbow light…”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord both stared at the rainbow light
before them. The rainbow light spanned an area of a hundred billion
kilometers, including the planet. “It… it actually is the
remaining presence and aura of someone else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying.”
Ning felt stunned. They hadn’t noticed anything from far away, but
upon moving closer they were able to sense and be shocked by the
highly withdrawn and reserved aura of the rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not light
at all. Those are waves of energy.” After taking a careful look,
Ning realized that this was a stream of diffused energy waves that
would never, ever dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some inconceivably
powerful figure must’ve struck through space and smashed the planet
apart, causing it to shatter and crumble. The remnants of the power
left behind by that strike have taken the form of this rainbow light
and been here ever since.” The Ninedust Sectlord took a careful
look, then pointed towards a certain part of the rainbow light. “The
rainbow light is denser over there. Most likely, that major power
must’ve launched his attack from that direction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
agreement. This was indeed a killing blow from a major power, and it
had the scent of eternity about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major power in
question was very possibly a Hegemon, or close to it,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said. “However… given how much time has passed, there
shouldn’t be much power left in the remnants of his strike. Let me
try it out first.” As he spoke, he stretched out his right arm,
which extended more than a thousand kilometers and passed through the
rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle, crackle,
crackle. The remnant energy within the rainbow light instantly began
to crush down towards the Ninedust Sectlord’s arm! This caused his
face to tighten slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not too bad. It’s
just a bit of leftover power, after all; I feel like it is merely on
par with our secret arts,” the Ninedust Sectlord said. “The two
of us can take it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief, then said with amazement, “The remnant power of a single
strike that was launched countless aeons ago is still on par with our
secret arts… what power is this?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look at the planet. Although it’s been shattered, we might still
find something nice here,” the Ninedust Sectlord said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Both
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord flew carefully into the rainbow light.
The energy within the rainbow light was folded in layers and
contained hidden undercurrents to it. Ning activated his nine
novessence arts and used them to form the Yin-Yang Sword Domain to
protect them, while the Ninedust Sectlord used his own Ripplewater
secret art. Together, the two managed to just barely resist the
suppressive might of the rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two shattered
halves are both enormous,” the Ninedust Sectlord said with a sigh.
One of the two halves was eight hundred million kilometers long,
while the second half was over five hundred million kilometers long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord landed upon the tattered planet. It was in absolutely dire
shape, with no living creatures on it at all, nor did it have any
flame demons or earth devils or other strange creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How desolate. Let’s
go underground and take a look at the core.” The planet where
Skywind lived had a core that could give birth to worldsplitter
stones, Dragonfish Ki, and other similar items. The two were
naturally quite interested in the core of this planet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the entire
planet had actually had essentially been smashed into two giant
pieces, one could imagine what bad shape it was in. As a result, the
two were able to fly directly into the core of the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The planet’s core
is shattered as well. There’s nothing here capable of giving birth
to new treasures,” Ning said. He swept the area with his gaze,
unable to discover any treasures akin to worldsplitter stones or
Dragonfish Ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, this time
you are wrong. The planetary core itself is a treasure. Look!” The
Ninedust Sectlord pointed towards ad istant rift in the core. “That
rift there is leaking a large amount of golden ‘sand’. There’s
no way anything leaking from the core of this planet could possibly
be anything but extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled, then
nodded. The main issue was that there was simply far too much of the
golden sand. The entire core was cracked, resulting in much of that
golden sand having spilled outside of it. The region of spilled
quicksand filled an area of over a hundred million kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still can’t tell
what this golden quicksand is.” The Ninedust Sectlord made a
grabbing motion towards a handful of quicksand on the ground. Moments
later, his face turned pale. He tugged viciously, causing all of the
golden sand within the hundred million kilometer region to tremble
slightly… but alas he wasn’t able to pull it to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, you can’t
even pick up a handful of this sand?” Ning was startled by what he
saw. He then chuckled teasingly, as he himself was beginning to
realize how special and unusual the golden sand was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you test
it out yourself.” The Ninedust Sectlord gave Ning a hard look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out as
well. It was quite easy for him to insert his fingers into the sand,
but when he tried to pull out a handful of it he felt as though the
sand was part of a complete whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Although Ning
used all the power he had, he was only able to cause the sand in the
area to slightly tremble. He wasn’t able to pull any out at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t do it
either, right?” The Ninedust Sectlord smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It reminds me of the
stone passageways,” Ning said. “When we tried to hack the stones
apart, we felt a counter-force emanate from the entire passageway.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “When we try to grab a handful of the
sand, all of the sand in this entire area is fighting back against
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly reached out once more. “Let me try a single grain of
sand.” These grains of sand were roughly the size of a fingernail,
much larger than ordinary ‘sand’. The Ninedust Sectlord let out a
grunt as he pulled with all his strength. Boom! He managed to pull a
single grain of sand into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, let me try
two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Ninedust
Sectlord and Ning were analyzing the sand of the planet’s core with
interest. Since this sand had filled the entire core, it had to be
the core’s primarily element. When undamaged, the planet’s core
should’ve possessed enough power to wipe out the two of them with
just the slightest of shockwaves. It was almost unbelievable that
they managed to find a core of such power that was completely
defenseless; there was no way the two would just pass such an
opportunity up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a period of time,
they verified that the more sand they tried to pull out at once, the
stronger the resisting power from the rest of the sand would be. The
difficulty level would quickly skyrocket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we slowly pick
this stuff up one grain at a time, it’ll take us forever. Let me
see if I can perhaps hack it apart with my sword.” Ning pulled out
a Northbow sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, if you can hack
it apart into smaller pieces it’ll be much easier.” The Ninedust
Sectlord stood back to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!” Ning
manifested [Three Heads, Six Arms] and gripped a single Northbow
sword with all six arms, then unleashed his most powerful attack:
Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker. BOOM! The sword slammed into the
defenseless sand, but when it moved deeper and sought to sever a
piece of it, an invisible source of power suddenly arose to stop it.
The power of Ning’s sword seemed to have sunk into a quagmire,
having been completely absorbed by the endless sand and causing just
a few vibrations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t work.”
Ning shook his head. “I can’t cut it apart. I’m not even close
to being strong enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One clear, child-like
voice rang out after another as six adorable children appeared. All
of them stared wide-eyed at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have the six of
you come out?” Ning chuckled. These six were the sword-spirits of
the six Northbow swords. They were Lifeblood weapons, and so they
were connected to Ning’s spirit and essence. Ning almost viewed
himself as their father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, the golden
sand…” The first Northbow sword, ‘Boss Northbow’, hurriedly
pointed to the flows of golden sand. “That golden sand is very
important to us. We can sense it! Can you give it to us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very important ot
you?” Ning immediately understood. Lifeblood weapons needed to
grow, but ordinary materials would be of no use to them. Clearly, the
golden sand had attracted their interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The six
children nodded simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninedust
Sectlord watched with amusement. “You actually have SIX of those
Lifeblood swords? Not bad, Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to banter with him for now. He said to the six children,
“But there’s no way for me to harvest or mine the golden sand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. Master,
just insert us into it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, insert us into
it. Let us absorb it into us.” All six of the children continued to
stare at Ning.

Chapter 30 – The Growing Northbow Swords
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was delighted
when he heard this. He waved his hand, causing all six black swords
to fly out from the sheath on his back and into the sea of flowing
sand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! They all plunged deep into the sand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, this is lovely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six children let
out excited cries as they flew back into their respective swords. The
six Northbow swords began to glow with a layer of golden light as the
sand around them began to lose its luster, quickly changing to become
a grayish-white color before then completely disappearing without a
trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, if
you encounter anything you like you can just let me know,” Ning
sent mentally to his six sword-spirtis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t know what
we like either. We can only sense something we want from a close
distance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! Master, if
you find anything powerful in the future, give it a few whacks with
us first and we’ll get a good sense of it,” the six sword-spirits
replied in chorus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, a smile
on his face as he watched the six Northbow swords furiously devour
the essence of the golden sands around them. A large amount of golden
sand was being rapidly converted into white dust and then vanish. In
the twinkling of an eye, more than half the golden sand in a thirty
meter area had completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninedust
Sectlord was rather jealous when he saw this. He hurriedly lifted up
his longstaff, then plunged it into the golden sand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” The Ninedust
Sectlord shook his head, putting away his longstaff. He glanced at
Ning. “Congratulations, Darknorth. It seems your Lifeblood weapons
are able to absorb the golden sand quite rapidly. Why is it that my
own Lifeblood weapon can make no use of it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess they aren’t
a good fit for each other,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless Territories
were filled with countless marvelous curios, but only a few of them
would be suitable for each person. Ning’s six Northbow swords had
been personally forged to perfection by Emperor Gonflame, as
perfection was needed in order to match Ning’s own Dao. They were
already nigh-flawless and thus very picky; thus far, they had shown
no interest in anything Ning had encountered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Entire
swathes of golden dust turned white and then vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This golden sand can
be considered a type of treasure. Actually harvesting it, however, is
a pain.” The Ninedust Sectlord laboriously gathered the golden sand
to himself, two grains at a time. After more than two hours, he had
only managed to gather roughly a washing basin’s worth of sand. By
the time he turned to look at Ning, he realized that virtually all of
the golden sand around them had been sucked away. He could do nothing
but shake his head and sigh. “Compared to how fast your Lifeblood
weapons are harvesting these things, I’m moving at a snail’s
pace. Mm. Well, I’ll keep harvesting. In the future I’ll ask and
find out what type of treasure this is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
watched, his mood excellent. He could sense that his six Northbow
swords were slowly growing in power as they themselves began to
transform and evolve. They had originally been black in color but now
they were starting to be tinged with gold, almost as though their
abyssal darkness was now brimming with faint golden light. They were
beginning to look like dark gold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four hours. Twelve
hours. One day. Two days. One month. Two months…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Northbow swords
remained plunged into the golden sands that had leaked out of the
shattered planet, furiously sucking away at the sand’s essence. Not
only were they changing in color, they were even changing in shape.
They were now even slimmer than before, but their tips and edges were
much sharper. Just looking at them, one could sense a terrifying aura
of power from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord had been fairly relaxed at first, but as time passed both of
them grew increasingly astonished. As the Northbow swords had
continuously drawn in more of the golden sands and evolved, the rate
at which they drew in the sand began to dramatically increase as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire sea of
golden sand was rumbling and rolling about, because the golden sands
at its deepest depths were being continuously wiped out. As a result,
‘waves’ were sweeping through the sea unceasingly and flowing
towards the six Northbow swords that had been inserted into the heart
of the shattered planet’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Lifeblood
weapons aren’t going to suck up all of the golden sand of this
planet’s core, are they? When in perfect condition, the planet’s
core possessed such power that neither of us would even dare to
approach it. If your weapons somehow managed to absorb all of that
power… how strong would they become?” The Ninedust Sectlord
stared in slack-jawed amazement. It must be understood that the outer
layer of the hundred-million-kilometer sea of golden sand had already
completely vanished. The swords were now primarily drawing from the
sands deep within the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more powerful,
the better.” Ning smiled. “This is an ancestral site of you
Ancient cultivators; I imagine there won’t be any legacies for me
here. I need to get what I can out of this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northbow swords had
completely transformed by now. They were now extremely thin,
completely golden in color, and glowed with a layer of light. If
other cultivators saw these new Northbow swords, they never would’ve
believed that they were the same swords as Ning had been wielding
just a short while ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to watch
eagerly. The planet’s core was truly an incalculably valuable
treasure; most likely, its value was comparable to that mountain of
darkspace flamestone in the alternate universe. His swords had
already absorbed so much of that precious golden sand that they had
undergone a fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Boom. Boom. A
series of booms rang out, followed by the six Northbow swords flying
into the skies and towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’m full.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t eat
another bite.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel wonderfully
stuffed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six children
appeared once more on the blades of the Northbow swords, incredibly
excited. With but a thought, Ning sent all six swords flying into the
sheath on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look! Look over
there!” The Ninedust Sectlord pointed at the planet’s core. Your
six swords must’ve drained roughly twenty to thirty percent of the
golden sand. I daresay that in material quality, they have a shot of
becoming Universe treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
pulling out one of the Northbow swords. “Let me test one out
first.” Ning felt extremely comfortable when holding that Northbow
sword, and its entire body glowed with that golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Swish. Ning
began to display his sword-arts. He first started with his defensive
sword-arts, because judging from how thin, slender, and sharp the
sword was he felt certain that its offensive properties would have
been strengthened. He wanted to savor this and save the best for
last, and so he decided to test out his defensive sword-arts first.
Upon doing so, Ning discovered to his joy that his sword-arts came
out even faster and more fluid than ever before. They were also
significantly more powerful as well; most likely, his defensive
prowess had increased by fifty to sixty percent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao –
Heavenbreaker!” Ning unleashed a furious chop. BOOM! A stream of
sword-light visible to the naked eye flew out from the tip of the
sword, slamming down through the rainbow light for several kilometers
before finally dissipating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s merely twice
as strong as before.” Ning shook his head slightly; this would be
of limited use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao –
Shadowless!” Next, Ning chose to test out the Shadowless stance.
This instantly caused a look of joy to appear on Ning’s face, as
the new Northbow sword was perfect for the Shadowless stance; it was
now faster, sharper, more ethereal, and more unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is four
times stronger than before,” Ning estimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao –
Blood Drop!” Ning struck out with a seemingly casual stab, but in
the final instant of the strike the sword-light twisted slightly. It
destroyed the local power of the Dao-aura unleashed by the prime
essences of the universe, forming a true void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The nearby
Ninedust Sectlord cried out in shock, “Y-you… your sword has
actually transcended space itself?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s actually
transcended space.” Ning revealed a delight look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The technique which
Emperor Mirrorsnow had mastered and used to gain eternity for himself
was a sword-art that transcended both space and time, allowing him to
pierce through his enmies even from countless kilometers away.
Neither space nor time could constrain his sword-arts, and his
enemies would be dead before they even had a chance to react. The
power of this attack was simply incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To surpass the limits
of time was to be inconceivably fast. As soon as Emperor Mirrorsnow
struck, his sword would slay his foe; there would be no ‘attack
time’ at all, as the attack would be instanteous. This was what
made transcending time so terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for transcending
space, it meant that distance was no longer an obstacle. Emperor
Mirrorsnow was capable of using his sword to slay an enemy who wasn’t
even in the same territory as him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transcending space was
comparatively easier. Transcending time was extremely difficult! Ning
had originally thought that when he became a Daolord of the Third
Step, his sword-arts would be able to transcend space. Who would’ve
thought that he’d accomplish it at the second step! But still, when
he thought about it in detail, it made sense to him. The essence the
Northbow swords had absorbed had caused them to be extremely ‘skewed’
in one area, whereas they had previously been balanced. They were now
much sharper and thus better-suited to the Blood Drop stance! The
Shadowless stance wasn’t improved as much, while the berserk
Heavenbreaker stance was barely improved. As for his defensive
sword-arts, they were improved the least of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to his
swords now being more suited to the Blood Drop stance, Ning had
improved the most in the Blood Drop sword-intent to begin with. The
Blood Drop sword-intent was highly destructive and thus suited for
tearing through the bonds of space and time; it naturally became the
first technique he could use to succeed in transcending space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you’ve
transcended space, ordinary dimensional bindings will no longer have
an effect on you. Even if an Eternal Emperor wished to kill you, you
would be able to easily pierce through the dimensions and then flee
through a dimensional tunnel. Only an Eternal Emperor who is
incredibly skilled in the Dao of Space would have a chance of tying
you down, with the vast majority of them being helpless against you.”
The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning, then let out a sigh.
“Darknorth, from this day forth, you now have a true life-saving
measure that you can use when you please. Very, very few people are
now capable of slaying you. You’ve transcended the bounds of space…
I have to admit, I truly envy you now.”

Chapter 31 – The Ancient Ancestor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning laughed. When
he had been at Skywood City and encountered Daolord Kongsan, the
latter had dimensionally locked the area with a formation, making it
impossible Ning to escape; his only option would’ve been to use his
vessel to slowly fly around inside! But now? His sword-arts surpassed
the limits of space and were able to forcibly rip out dimensional
passageways, allowing him to easily escape. Only someone who had
reached an extremely high level in the Dao of Space would be able to
restrict Ning’s movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast majority of
Eternal Emperors would not be able to bar Ning’s path. This was a
true life-preserving method he now had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kongsan was able to
transform into darkness incarnate, a virtually unkillable form. This
was his own life-preserving method which ensured that even the likes
of Palace Lord Dawnstar would be unable to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning would be able
to use his swords to transcend space, making it so that dimensional
shackling would be unable to bind him. He would also be able to tear
through space and flee at a moment’s notice. This was a
life-preserving method that was every bit a match for Kongsan’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very few
figures even amongst exceptionally powerful second-tier Daolords like
Ning and Kongsan who had such incredible life-preserving methods. The
Ninedust Sectlord, for example, didn’t have any such technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the most
supreme of Daolords such as Dawnstar or Skyaxe, the ones who stood at
the very precipice of power, all had Daos of such incredible power
that they had life-preserving abilities similar to that of spatial
transcendence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why they were
all generally extremely difficult to kill. However, a Hegemon would
probably be able to wipe them out with the wave of a hand. Perhaps
some of the freakishly powerful ancient figures such as the lords of
the eight Sacred Cities, second only to the Hegemons in power and who
Hegemons wouldn’t necessarily be able to kill, might be able to
slay the supreme Daolords. These figures were far more powerful than
even Emperor Mirrorsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Hegemons and
near-Hegemons were incredibly rare and exalted figures. The three
Hegemons belonged to the Brightshore Kingdom, the Aberrant special
lifeforms, and the Ancient cultivators. These three were the rulers
and sovereigns their entire race. As for the near-Hegemons, they were
amongst the most powerful figures each race or organization had. For
now, Ning wasn’t at a level where he could get embroiled into
fights with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t feel jealous
of me. Once you become a Daolord of the Fourth Step, I’m sure
you’ll have access to a formidable protective ability of your own,”
Ning said. The Ninedust Sectlord had merged two Supreme Daos
together, which meant that when he became a Daolord of the Fourth
Step he would instantly become one of the most powerful Daolords
around. None of those Daolords would be easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “I’m not too far away from breaking
through to the fourth step anyhow. With just a few more insights,
I’ll be able to break through my bottleneck and reach the final
step. By then, my mastery over water will easily allow me to gain an
‘undying waterform body’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled and
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ‘undying waterform
body’ was a fairly common technique amongst those who had reached
an extremely high level in the Dao of Water. This was a technique
that was much stronger than Kongsan’s ability to dissolve into
darkness incarnate. Kongsan had only comprehended a single Supreme
Dao, after all; his ‘darkness incarnate’ form was simply not
flawless enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By then, I can just
stand there and let you hit me without fighting back, but you still
won’t be able to injure me,” the Ninedust Sectlord boasted
smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning mumbled
mentally to himself, you know, I’m actually just a Daolord of the
Second Step…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
had mastered his Ripplewater secret art, while Ning had now evolved
his lifeblood weapons. Both had benefited significantly from this
adventure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
stood atop the surface of the shattered planet. “The only thing of
value here was the core, but harvesting it is too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is, but
you made a killing off of it…” The Ninedust Sectlord chuckled as
he scanned his surroundings, then pointed to the source of the
rainbow light. “Let’s move over there. The rainbow light is
denser over there; that should be the direction from which the
ancient power launched the strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go take
a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
flew off the planet and towards the rainbow light. They flew several
hundred kilometers alongside the light stream, moving towards the
source. Both of them were quite curious; this was an ancestral site
of the Ancient cultivators. Who could’ve been able to destroy a
planet such as this? Most likely, only a Hegemon-level figure or
someone close to that level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! They traversed
through space and reached the end of the rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord stared in amazement at the cluster of
stone passageways ahead of them. The stone passageways were brimming
with flame demons, but the streak of rainbow light flew straight
through the stone passageways… and the place it flew through was an
absolutely enormous straight passageway that was at least two billion
kilometers wide! Based on the other nearby tunnels, it could be
ascertained that the ‘rainbow passageway’ was actually once
filled with countless stone passageways that had been completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying,”
the Ninedust Sectlord murmured. “A single strike blasted through
countless stone passageways, forming a single enormous one in their
stead… and then, after being weakened due to having gone through so
many passageways, continued through to blast apart that planet! It
had to have been a Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree that only a
Hegemon could’ve done such a thing,” Ning concurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This level of power was
incredible. Both of them had learned for themselves how tough the
stone passageways were, but someone had been able to blast through
two billion kilometers worth of stone then shatter that planet with a
single strike. This level of power was beyond their imagination. As
they saw it, only the nigh-omnipotent Hegemons could’ve done such a
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place must
really be that legendary place…” Waves of shock and awe began to
fill the Ninedust Sectlord’s heart as he grew certain of his guess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, Ninedust.
Let’s go through and see what lies on the other end of the rainbow
passageway,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. The two then flew into the rainbow
passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainbow passageway
was brimming with remnant power. There was simply no way to avoid it,
and so both used their secret arts to resist as best possible. After
being ablated by their secret arts, the remnant power no longer posed
a threat to them at all when it washed over their divine bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainbow passageway
was two billion kilometers wide and so long that they couldn’t see
to the end of it. The two followed the rainbow light, forging a
pathway forwards. The closer they moved to the source, the stronger
the layers of power became. However, they were both able to hold; for
now, they had yet to reach their limits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
sent mentally, “If we were pulled into a fight, I’d only be able
to unleash around 20% of my full power right now. This is absolutely
terrifying. The remnant power from a single strike that was unleashed
countless aeons ago is still able to suppress me to such an extent!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been whittled
down to a fraction of my full power as well,” Ning said. He had the
Hegemon’s armor, allowing him to endure the damage, but the fact
that the remnant energy was so omnipresent meant that he would at
most be able to pull out 30%-40% of his true power when using
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to fly
forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that an entrance
up ahead?” Ning was rather puzzled. The rainbow light lowered
visibility, but he could vaguely see that the end was up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does look like
that.” The Ninedust Sectlord gripped his longstaff and sent
mentally, “Be careful, Darknorth. Let’s not lose our lives at the
very end of this journey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
manifested three heads and six arms and wielded his six Northbow
swords with great caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! There
really was an exit a the end of the rainbow tunnel. When they
simultaneously flew through the tunnel, they suddenly felt their
bodies expanding dramatically in size. Ten thousand times, a million
times, a billion times…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
Both of them felt perplexed and they simultaneously turned to look
backwards. They saw a hole directly behind them; this was the hole
they had just flown out of. As they had rapidly increased in size,
the hole had shrank in comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-t-that’s…”
Both of them were stupefied. Behind them they saw a towering,
pitch-black humanoid figure lying on the ground. The figure was
540,000 meters tall, and a hole that was just a few meters wide could
be seen over his chest. Clearly, the hole had punctured straight
through his chest and into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord, they had just flown out of this humanoid
creature’s chest wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two landed on the
ground. They stared at the fallen, towering giant figure with
astonished gazes. “W-w-we were actually inside its body this entire
time?” Ning could hardly believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those countless
stone passageways we went through were just part of its body? Those
flame demons and earth devils, and that powerful planet? They were
all just part of its body as well?” The Ninedust Sectlord couldn’t
believe it either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grain of sand, an
entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This humanoid creature
looked like it was ‘merely’ 540,000 meters tall, but within its
body was an endlessly vast space that gave birth to flame demons,
earth devils, and even mortal lifeforms! This was truly unbelievable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t think it
was an actual living being. Actual living beings should have divine
power and Immortal energy within their bodies, but it only had those
endless stone passageways,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t seem to
be a cultivator.” Ning nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They then began to
carefully inspect their surroundings. This was an enormous cave they
were in, and they were in just one corner of it. The two began to
walk through the cave and inspect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over there.”
Ning pointed off into the distance, a stunned look on his face. Far
away there were two figures who could be seen. One was a white-robed
figure who lay on the ground, completely unmoving. The other was
seated in the lotus position, a peaceful look on his face. Both of
these enormous figures emanated auras of incredible might, the might
of a Hegemon. Ning had seen three Hegemon corpses in the Genesis
Lands of the alternate universe, and now he had found two more here
in this cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” The
Ninedust Sectlord stared at the two figures, his gaze quickly
focusing on the man seated peacefully in the lotus position. The
Ninedust Sectlord’s body trembled slightly as he murmured, “An
ancestor. That’s one of the ancestors…”

Chapter 32 – The History of the Terror Starsea
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, so this is
an ancestor of the Ancient cultivators?” Upon hearing the Ninedust
Sectlord’s mumbles, Ji Ning turned to look curiously at the
peaceful-looking man seated in the lotus position. The man seemed to
be a world unto himself, and was filled with peace and benevolence.
Just looking at him, Ning felt calm and tranquil in his heart. In
addition, the ancient figure gave Ning a very strange feeling, a
feeling similar to the one which the Ninedust Sectlord gave him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps this was due to
the fact that members of the same race would all share certain
commonalities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had first met
the Ninedust Sectlord, he had no idea that the man was an Ancient
cultivator. Once he met more of them, however, he would probably be
able to recognize them at a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This is one of
our oldest ancestors.” The Ninedust Sectlord walked over in a
reverential manner. Ning followed from behind, inspecting the man
closely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two deceased
Hegemons. The white-robed Hegemon simply lay there on the ground, and
just by moving closer to him Ning began to feel as though the world
around him was twisting and distorting into hallucinations.
Fortunately, his soul and his mind were both very strong, and the
effect was nothing more than a natural phenomena caused by the
presence of the deceased Hegemon’s body. As a result, Ning was able
to endure the effect. By comparison, the Ancient cultivator seated in
the lotus position was much more peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they moved
closer, the Ninedust Sectlord fell to his knees and kowtowed
respectfully. “Redwater pays his respects to you, ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a dark-red
longstaff to the side of the Ancient ancestor, and the aura emanating
from it shocked Ning. “A Universe treasure?” He had seen the
broken sword in the Sword Palace of the Brightshore Kingdom, and had
also encountered the deceased Sword Hegemon’s dark blue greatsword
in the Genesis Lands of the alternate universe. As a result, he was
able to almost instantly ascertain that the dark-red longstaff next
to this Ancient ancestor was also a Universe treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A stream of
light suddenly flew out from the dark-red longstaff, transforming
into a bald, black-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen.” The
bald, black-robed youth had a calm, peaceful gaze that seemed to hold
all the stars in the night sky, and his voice echoed within the cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” the
Ninedust Sectlord immediately called out humbly, a hint of excitement
in his eyes. This was a Universe treasure! And a longstaff at that.
He himself used longstaffs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
called out with respect as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any and every Universe
treasure was worthy of respect, because every single one was born
after experiencing endless trials and tribulations. They were utterly
supreme amongst treasures, and they would only submit to those whom
they truly acknowledged. Otherwise, there was no way to control them
whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the fifth
and the sixth to come to this place,” the bald, black-robed youth
said peacefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
stunned upon hearing this. The fifth and the sixth? When they had
visited Skywind’s homeland, they had been the fourth and the fifth.
It seemed as though there was another expert who had reached this
place without entering Skywind’s home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you have been
able to survive and reach this place, it means that you both have had
a number of fortuitous encounters in your life. Before dying, Master
ordained that all Ancient cultivators would have a chance to earn
some rewards from him if they could pass some of his tests. If there
is someone capable of passing all the tests, I would be willing to
follow that person,” the youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pass all the tests?”
The Ninedust Sectlord’s eyes lit up. If he passed everything, he
would gain a Universe treasure? In the past, he never would’ve even
dared to imagine such a thing. It must be remembered that virtually
no Eternal Emperors wielded Universe treasures, much less Daolords.
Only the most ridiculously lucky of Daolords would ever have a chance
to acquire a Universe treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Vulturas
came to this place before. Did he fail the test?” Ning suddenly
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
was stunned. Oh, right. Patriarch Vulturas had completed his Daomerge
in Skywind’s homeland. After gaining eternity, he became a major
power who was second only to the Hegemons in might. Had he failed to
acquire the Universe treasure as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vulturas did indeed
come here. He was the only Eternal Emperor to make it here, and he
gained a prize for himself.” The youth nodded. “But passing the
trials requires not just power; it also requires destiny. Vulturas
and I were not destined to be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask, what are
the trials?” The Ninedust Sectlord was rather excited. He was
willing to risk everything for this. If he was lucky, he might end up
with an Eternal weapon as the prize!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you need to do
is walk closer to Master. Master set up formations and restrictive
spells in the area; once you activate them, the trials will begin,”
the youth said. “The better you perform, the more gifts you shall
win for yourself. I shall be the arbiter of it all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
Ninedust Sectlord immediately walked over, moving towards the
peacefully seated Ancient ancestor. Suddenly, he seemed to run into
an invisible barrier. A few dimensional fluctuations spread out, and
he disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth then turned
to glance at Ning. He said calmly, “You are not an Ancient
cultivator. You are not permitted to earn any of my Master’s
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I personally don’t
have any bias against non-Ancient cultivators,” the black-robed
youth said. “However, Master’s dying instructions were that if
our side won the Dawn War, his treasures were to be left to Ancient
cultivators and Ancient cultivators alone. However, if our side lost
the Dawn War, then anyone would be able to win his treasures, be they
Aberrants, Chaos Godbeasts, or ordinary cultivators like yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. “The
Dawn War?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You do not know of
it?” The youth asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth nodded in an
uncaring manner. “It was a war that caused the true downfall of the
Ancient cultivators as a race. Long, long ago, the Ancient
cultivators were born from the primordial chaos as the most perfect
of all living beings. They unified the entire universe under their
rule! Even the Chaos Godbeasts were enslaved by them, while the
Aberrants were all forced to bend the knee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
heard of this before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, as time
flowed on, more and more ordinary mortal beings came to be born.
Ordinary mortals expanded and propagated at incredible speeds, and
thus they rose to power at an inconceivable rate. They quickly became
a race that was second only to the Ancient cultivators in the endless
primordial chaos, and towards the end they actually became close to a
match for the Ancients.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. The Dao Alliance truly was formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But then, a disaster
happened. This disaster was an extremely large-scale one. Many
powerful cultivators in our homeland and even in distant places
within the Great Dark were forced to join hands and fight back
against this tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A tribulation?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” The youth
pointed towards the slumped humanoid figure off in the distance. “You
just came out of its body. You should’ve noticed that it is
different from ordinary cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Ordinary
cultivators should’ve had divine power in their bodies. How could
they have stone passageways, flame demons, earth devils, and strange
planets?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was a member of
our enemies, one of the most powerful of their kind,” the youth
said. “If we lost that war, we would’ve been annihilated. If they
lost, they would’ve been annihilated as well. This was a war of
extermination, a war for survival. Both sides fought like mad, and
all of us here joined forces. Back then, our five Hegemons commanded
a host of Eternal Emperors to fight back against them! Even experts
came from deep within the Great Dark to reinforce us… and in the
end, a great battle was fought in the place now known as the Terror
Starsea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle was
known as the Dawn War.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, we
Ancients had a total of three Hegemons. The Dao Alliance had one
Hegemon, while the Aberrants also had one Hegemon. All of them died.”
The youth continued, “An incredible number of powerful experts took
part in that battle, and a steady stream of reinforcements came from
within or beyond the Great Dark. The battle within the Terror Starsea
was absolutely terrifying, and in the end I learned that the Dao
Alliance, the Ancients, and the others resettled their homeland. This
meant that the enemy had been defeated. We had won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dawn War was a
severe below to the Ancient cultivators. They had lost all three of
their Hegemons.” The bald, black-robed youth shook his head and
sighed. “The Dao Alliance was actually the quickest to recover, and
many of their experts eventually drifted into the endless Great Dark
in search of adventure. Do not blame Master for being unwilling to
share his treasures with you; he knew that you ordinary cultivators
would recover far more quickly than his race would. So long as you
were not completely wiped out, there would definitely come a day
where you surpassed the Ancients. For him to show a bit of
selfishness in caring more about his own race is normal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It seemed
as though the Endless Territories had something of a secret history
to it. No wonder the Terror Starsea was such a terrifying place; it
had actually been the locale of the great Dawn War.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the endless Great
Dark also holds many experts?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, of course.”
The bald, black-robed youth nodded. “There are many who have spent
ages drifting through the endless Great Dark, which means it holds
many powerful experts indeed. However, they are far too distant from
us; even if you spent a hundred thousand chaos cycles travelling, you
might not be able to reach them. Generally speaking, only Eternal
Emperors would ever be so bored as to embark on such a distant
journey. It was only due to how vitally important the Dawn War was
that our allies hastened to the Terror Starsea, where the battle was
to be held. The battle against our foes was so violent that even now
the Terror Starsea is filled with countless dangers. Even Hegemons
might perish here, if they aren’t careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah. There’s no
need for a Daolord like you to know too much. In short, we wiped our
enemies out and all the territories now belong to us once more.”
The youth let out a chuckle. “In the end, our side won the Dawn
War.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly. It
seemed as though in the past, the Ancient cultivators were actually
an incredibly powerful force within the Endless Territories. They had
three Hegemons! Alas, those three had perished during the war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dawn War
represented the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. The era
of the Ancients and their unified rule had ended; the era of the Dao
Alliance had begun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, am I
supposed to just stand here and wait?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, you can just
wait here. There really is nothing here for you. The only reason you
were even able to come here was because you were alongside an Ancient
cultivator.” The youth nodded.

Chapter 33 – Within the Cave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing whatsoever?”
Ji Ning was rather surprised by this. He then turned to glance at the
white-robed form. “What about the white-robed Hegemon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was the Hegemon
of the Dao Alliance,” the bald, black-robed youth said. “During
that great war, he died in battle but managed to deliver a heavy
wound to our enemy. My master managed to follow that up with a lethal
blow, but the enemy managed to heavily wound my master before
perishing. My master’s wounds were so heavy that he knew he
wouldn’t be able to survive, and so he left behind his legacies and
his will for future Ancients to inherit. As for the Dao Alliance’s
Hegemon, he didn’t have the chance to leave behind any legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for his
treasures… well, my master naturally took them all and arranged for
them to be given to future Ancients who could pass his trials,” the
youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked a few
times. But those treasures were the treasures of an elder of the Dao
Alliance. I’m a member of the Dao Alliance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning could do
nothing but grumble mentally. In truth, he understood what the
Hegemon must have been thinking. Once the Dawn War ended, the era of
the Ancient cultivators would have come to an end as well, and the
Dao Alliance would become the new rulers of the Endless Territories.
He naturally had to make certain preparations for the Ancient race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place we are in
looks like a cave, but it is actually a sealed-off estate-world which
Master once used to trap and slay his foes,” the youth said.
“There’s no way for you to leave this place on your own. If you
wish to leave, I can send you off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush just yet,”
Ning said. This was a place where two Hegemons had battled an enemy
to the death. He naturally had to spend some time inspecting it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. How long
will it be before Ninedust’s trials conclude?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth slowly shook
his head. “I don’t know. If he is fast, perhaps a thousand years.
If he takes a long time, even ten million years wouldn’t be out of
the realm of question. Master truly did make meticulous preparations
for his Ancient successors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some
retainers with me. Can I release them here and let them take a look?”
Ning asked. The white-robed Hegemon’s corpse generated a powerful
natural field of illusions; it might be of use to Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The youth
said calmly, “But if they are not Ancient cultivators, none of them
will be able to gain any of my master’s legacies! Also, you are not
permitted to cause any damage to the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse.
He died for the sake of our homeland, and so Master set up spells in
the area around him. If any of you try to cause damage to his corpse,
you’ll suffer a counter-attack from Master’s spells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A final reminder.
This cave is filled with quite a few vestigial scars from the battle
that was fought here, and they might be of use to you in meditating
on the Dao. The others who came here in the past also allowed their
servants to come out and inspect the battlefield scars. If and when
you are ready to leave, just notify me.” The youth finished his
words, then transformed into a stream of light that flew into the
dark-red longstaff nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cave was completely
silent once more. Ning scanned his surroundings. This was a place
where two Hegemons had died. Ning still felt hopeful that there was
perhaps some good fortune waiting for him here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now all alone
within the cave. Ninedust had gone off to test himself against the
trials, and so Ning had no choice but to slowly search the area for
himself and see if there was anything useful for him here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder where this
enemy came from?” Ning returned to the pitch-black humanoid corpse
that was 540,000 meters tall. “It actually managed to kill two
Hegemons. Its entire corpse is probably a priceless treasure,” Ning
mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A small portion of the
‘golden sand’ from the shattered planet’s core had allowed
Ning’s six Northbow swords to undergo an earthshaking
transformation. Skywind’s home planet was similarly extraordinary.
Ning surmised that the corpse probably held other unique things
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
waved a finger, attempting to drag the corpse into his estate-world.
However, the pitch-black humanoid corpse just lay there slumped, not
moving at all. Clearly, there was no way someone like Ning could
possibly move it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.” Ning’s
body suddenly blurred as he expanded to become 540,000 meters tall as
well. He was now the exact same size as the corpse. Ning reached out
with his hands to grab the corpse by its elbows. Given that the
target had died long ago, there was no way for it to resist him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here!”
Hands around the corpse’s elbows, Ning did his best to lift it
upwards… but the corpse didn’t even budge in the slightest. Ning
felt as though he was an ordinary man who was trying to lift up a
massive mountain! There was no way to budge it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even the corpse
of a Hegemon should be this heavy. Still, it makes sense. I can’t
even budge or shake the planets in its body. How can I possibly move
the entire corpse?” Ning tried moving the corpse multiple times,
but wasn’t able to so much as budge the thing. In the end, he had
no choice but to give up. He couldn’t help but feel even more
puzzled; how had this humanoid creature been created? Was it like a
golem-type magic treasure, or the Hegemon of some sort of strange,
unique race?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent quite some
time pondering over the humanoid corpse. It obviously was an
incredibly valuable treasure, but there was nothing he could do at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should he go back
inside? But even when he had been fighting alongside the Ninedust
Sectlord, they had still been forced to use Dao-seals to escape the
corpse. Ning really didn’t want to take on the risk of going back
inside! In addition, he had the feeling that he probably wouldn’t
be able to find much within the corpse. The golden sand had only come
out of the shattered planet’s core because of the fatal strikes
delivered by two Hegemons. Otherwise, how would Ning ever had a
chance to get his hands on something so valuable?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as Ning could
tell, the only wound on the black humanoid body was that wound across
the chest. The other parts of its body seemed completely undamaged;
it seemed unlikely that Ning would be able to gain much from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the stone
walls?” Just like the others, Ning ended up deciding to give up
trying to move the humanoid corpse and instead began to inspect the
walls. Might there be any treasures littered here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None at all! Even if
there had been any, the others probably would’ve swept them clean
long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his hand to
gently trace some of the scars left behind on the walls. Although
this cave was actually a top-grade Eternal treasure, it was covered
with ancient scars from that long-ago battle. The emanations of the
Dao radiating from those scars caused Ning to fall into a state of
intoxication.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These scars can be
divided into representing three different types of ‘intent’. It
seems they pertain to the two Hegemons and the humanoid corpse,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One type of intent was
an overwhelming, awe-inspiring, radiant intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second intent was
that of a furious, endless flood of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third was that of a
baleful metallic will. In terms of aura, the metallic one was
actually slightly weaker than the other two intents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The intent of
radiant light belonged to the white-robed Hegemon. The intent of
water belonged to the Ancient ancestor.” Ning was able to quickly
verify which belonged to which, as the two Hegemon corpses continued
to emanate waves of power and presence as well. “Then that means
the black humanoid corpse represented that metallic will. So it
actually had a Dao of its own, and its own Dao was second to just
that of the Hegemons.” Ning was rather amazed by all of these
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing four figures to appear by his side. They were Su Youji,
Pillsaint, Daolord Naia, and Daolord Bruteflame. After Ning had
captured Daolord Bruteflame, the man had naturally submitted and
chosen to serve Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” All four
of them hurriedly called out to Ning with respect as they looked
curiously at their surroundings. They didn’t really pay much
attention to the humanoid corpse, but the two distant Hegemon corpses
caused all of them to feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” The
four could scarcely believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are the
corpses of a pair of Hegemons,” Ning confirmed. “Don’t just
stand there like idiots. I came to this place alongside the Ninedust
Sectlord, but I won’t be able to get any legacies from it. There
are some battle-scars on the cave walls that you can examine which
might be of assistance to you in comprehending the Dao. Youji, the
closer you move to the white-robed Hegemon, the more powerful the
field of illusions around it becomes. It might be of use to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All four of them were
completely stunned, but they quickly calmed down upon hearing Ning’s
instructions. Ning trusted all four of them implicitly, because they
had all sworn lifeblood oaths to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scars of battle left
behind by Hegemons?” They all began to explore the cave and inspect
the walls. As for Ning, he lifted his head to gaze at the cave walls
as well as he sought to better understand the Hegemon’s Dao.
Although this wasn’t the Dao of the Sword, all Daos shared certain
commonalities. Daolord Allgod, for example, delighted in training in
all types of Daos. He had even trained in the Dao of the Sword! This
was because all Daos had a chance to stimulate and enlighten you.
There was no way Ning would allow himself to miss the chance to
analyze the Dao of a Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning and his
four retainers began to train and meditate within the cave. Su Youji
trained in the Dao of Fire, while the white-robed Hegemon was a
master of the Dao of Light, but both Daos were highly suited to
illusions! Mastery over illusions was not exclusive to Heartforce
Cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible. This is
absolutely incredible. Radiance… free will… how can illusions
reach such an incredible level?” Su Youji was completely stunned
and dazed by what she found. She was the successor of Feixian the
Exalted, and was a true master of the art of illusions and charm.
However, she wasn’t even close to being a match for this Hegemon.
The mere illusory ripples generated by the white-robed Hegemon’s
corpse filled her with indescribable awe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master! Come
over here, quickly!” After meditating for five months, Su Youji
began to call out for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning had been
seated in the lotus position, staring at the cave walls. He turned
his head to look at Su Youji.

completely silent, with Ji Ning and the other three retainers
completely absorbed in the profound mysteries of the Dao contained
within the scars on the wall. Su Youji’s sudden shout startled all
four of them, and they turned to look at her as she ran towards Ning,
her face filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, Youji?”
Ning rose to his feet and began to walk towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The white-robed
Hegemon was absolutely incredible. He’s just… just…” Su Youji
was so excited she could barely speak properly. “Master, you have
to test it out for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course he was
incredible. He was a Hegemon!” Ning looked at her. “When I moved
towards him, I could sense the field of illusions surrounding him.
That’s why I told you to go to him and meditate there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not it!”
Su Youji repeatedly shook her head. “Master, you probably didn’t
move too close to the Hegemon’s body, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did not.” Ning
shook his head. As soon as he sensed the field of illusions start to
affect him, he immediately elected to keep a safe distance from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, if you had
moved closer you would’ve found out for yourself.” Su Youji said
quickly, “The closer you are, the more marvelous those illusions
are. My master, Feixian the Exalted, was skilled in the arts of charm
and control, and she was also incredibly skilled in the art of
illusions. Do you know what the apex of mastery over illusions is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The apex?” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The apex of
illusions… is reality!” Su Youji’s eyes were filled with
excitement. “With but a thought, you can create illusions that are
as real as reality itself. That represents the utmost apex of mastery
over illusions, a level at which even most Eternal Emperors wouldn’t
be able to tell the illusions apart from reality and thus would
easily die within the dream. I feel certain that this white-robed
Hegemon’s mastery over illusions must have reached this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face paled
slightly. The apex of illusions was reality? If you couldn’t even
tell the illusions apart from reality, then it really would be easy
for you to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The closer I moved
towards him, the more real the illusions became,” Su Youji said.
“Although this Hegemon died long ago and these illusions are
naturally generated by his corpse, I can tell just how terrifying his
mastery over illusions must have been when he was alive. I’m fairly
weak, and so I wasn’t able to move much closer to him. You are much
stronger than me, Master. I’m sure that once you move close to him,
you’ll experience for yourself the illusions which are as real as
reality itself. Given that the Hegemon has already died, these
illusions shouldn’t prove to be much of a threat to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you have to
go test it out for yourself.” Su Youji looked at Ning eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reality, eh?” Ning
felt rather intrigued as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you experience
it personally, you have to describe it for me. I have the feeling
that my mastery over illusions is already close to that of my own
master, Feixian the Exalted. It would be incredible if I could
surpass her in this area!” Su Youji let out a sigh. “Thank
goodness these illusions cannot attack people.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
experts who relied on illusions used them to mystify and trap their
opponents, then delivered a mortal strike to slay them! The
white-robed Hegemon, however, was dead. His illusions could mystify
and entrap them, but there was no mechanism for actually killing
them; the Hegemon himself was dead, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
try.” Ning walked towards the white-robed Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning moved closer
and closer to the white-robed Hegemon, the illusions slowly began to
fill his mind. Reality began to gradually dissipate, replaced by
illusions which began to seep into Ning’s mind. However, Ning’s
azureflower mist energy had only grown even more pure after he became
a Daolord of the Second Step, which meant that his soul was naturally
on a higher level than that of most Daolords of the Fourth Step.
Given that his heartforce was at the verge of the sixth stage, he
really was quite skilled in resisting illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive.” Ning
continued his advance. Reality around him was beginning to fade away,
while the illusions were becoming increasingly real. Dazzling women
appeared by his side, as did rare magic treasures and vile demons…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can actually no
longer tell apart what is real and what is not.” Ning remained
clear-minded, but he could no longer see any flaws in the illusions.
He was now completely surrounded by illusory images, with a group of
seductive beauties carrying platters of wine and food towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning’s
Dao-heart could not be shaken by such things, and so he forcibly
dispelled the illusions around him. But as he continued to advance
towards the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse, the illusions came
sweeping towards him once more. This time, they were even more
persistent and pervasive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was in an
actual life-or-death battle, illusions on this level would be able to
affect me for a brief period of time… and during that brief moment,
I would probably be struck and even killed.” Ning was secretly
amazed. What terrifying illusions! Thankfully, the white-robed
Hegemon was already dead. It didn’t matter how long the illusions
were able to trap him for; the only thing that mattered was that he
could still awaken from them, given enough time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is as
impressive as always.” Su Youji watched as Ning advanced towards
the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse. She couldn’t help but feel
rather excited by his progress. “He really is incredible. He’s
made it much farther than I did, and is much closer to the Hegemon’s
corpse. I already reached my limit much earlier; if I tried to
proceed, my will and mind would’ve grown blurry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji knew very well
that when surrounded by passive illusions, she could allow herself to
be trapped by them but her soul and her mind had to maintain a
minimum level of clarity. If she couldn’t even do that, then she
would gradually forget who she even was and would be forever trapped
in an illusory world, never to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was finding it
harder and harder to resist the illusions as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break. Break.
Break!” Ning had to spend two full seconds in order to forcibly
dispel the illusions this time. A stunned look was in his eyes. This
was absolutely terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two full seconds? In a
fight at his level, he would’ve died countless times over by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to keep
advancing. I want to see just how powerful these illusions can
become.” Ning’s Dao-heart remained unaffected, and his soul and
his mind remained quite clear. Even though he was finding it harder
and harder to break free from the illusions, he still knew that he
was Ji Ning of the Three Realms. So long as his mind was still
intact, he could continue advancing. As soon as he felt his mind
begin to slip, he would immediately begin to withdraw!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning took another
step forward, the surrounding illusions suddenly seemed to explode
and transform. The world he was in was a world of singing birds and
fragrant flowers. He was in a village within a beautiful mountain
valley. The forests had a few villagers within them, and Ning was an
ordinary village youth who made his living as a woodcutter…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This illusion…”
Ning was dressed in rough clothes and had a woodcutter’s axe over
his shoulders. He stared at his surroundings, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance was
a stream of water that looked clear and refreshing, with a few small
fish swimming about in it. He could make out every single scale with
perfect clarity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him was a stalk
of bamboo, emanating a fragrant scent. Beneath his feet was a patch
of wild grass that was covered in glistening, jewel-like dew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Erbao! Erbao!” An
old woman’s voice rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mom’s calling to
me.” This thought suddenly entered Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This illusion is
absolutely terrifying. I feel as though I’ve been reborn into a new
life and a new world.” Ning was stunned. “Everything seems so
completely real. The smiles of the villagers, the movements of the
fish, the aura of the natural world… everything seems perfectly
real.” This really did seem like an actual, real world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!”
Ning’s will was roaring loudly. BOOM! The illusory world trembled
for a brief moment. The distant woman, the villagers, and even the
village dogs all twisted and distorted for a brief instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I said break!”
Ning’s will bellowed out again. “Break! Break! Break!” Ning’s
will continued to bellow furiously. He was still clear-minded.
Although his will was bound and constrained by this illusory world,
Ning still had the power to struggle to break free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the illusory
world shattered into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I took eighteen full
seconds before I was able to escape?” Ning was rather stunned. He
was incredibly strong in terms of resisting illusions, even amongst
elite Daolords, but he had still been trapped for nearly twenty
seconds before breaking free. This Hegemon was simply terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another step.”
Ning took another step forwards. “Hmm. Have I reached the end?”
Ning continued to advance, only to find that the power of the
illusions had ceased to increase. No matter how much further he
advanced, the power did not change in the slightest. By now, Ning was
less than three meters away from the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse.
He was prevented from advancing any further by a formation, but the
power of the illusions didn’t increase at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you were
able to make it to the Hegemon’s corpse?” The distant Su Youji
was rather excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I’ll meditate for a time. No need to disturb me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things were actually
still quite tough for Ning, because he was being repeatedly swept up
into the illusions and forced to repeatedly break free from them.
“These illusions were merely created by the Hegemon’s corpse. If
he was still alive, how terrifying would his illusions be? And these
illusions truly are marvelous. I can’t see any flaws in them
whatsoever; they look just the same as reality itself. Fortunately,
my soul is strong enough that I can maintain a modicum of clarity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position, no longer fighting back against the illusions and
allowing himself to be swept into that illusory world. “Each time I
enter this illusion, I feel as though I’ve been reborn into a new
world. I can’t see any flaws in the illusions at all and have to
struggle to free myself. This is a good way to temper my Dao-heart
and strengthen my mind. Perhaps it will be of assistance to me in
breaking through to the sixth stage of heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning did not
realize was that this white-robed Hegemon had used his ultimate
mastery of the Dao of Light to develop his own technique, the
‘Allworld Tribulation’, and then used it to gain eternity for
himself! As soon as he broke through to the Eternal level, he became
a Hegemon! As a Daolord, he was a terrifyingly strong figure who had
merged together two Supreme Daos. After finally mastering his own
ultimate Dao, the Allworld Tribulation, he had become a truly
terrifying Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he died, his
eternal corpse naturally continued to hold some of the power and aura
of his Allworld Tribulation within it. When he was still alive, the
natural illusions emanating from his body would’ve completely swept
Ning into their grasp. He would’ve forgotten himself, forever lost
within the illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining power in
his corpse was nothing more than a tiny fraction of the true power
this Hegemon had once wielded.

Chapter 35 – Heartforce, Stage Six – World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was completely
absorbed by the Allworld Tribulation’s illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning became a
fisherman’s child. When he was young, he would accompany his father
in fishing on the sea. He eventually fell in love with a rich man’s
daughter, but her family looked down upon him. On one seafaring
voyage, his father ended up perishing, resulting in Ning braving the
oceans by himself. Slowly, the clever Ning learned more and more
tricks for catching fish. He gradually accumulated a fortune, then
purchased a large ship for himself. As his fishing skills continued
to improve, he became a legend amongst fisherman. He eventually had
over a hundred sails within his fleet, and the rich girl’s family
actually came to him to make amends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world
without cultivation. His life was an ordinary one, and it started
with him being a youth who slowly grew up, becoming a towering figure
by his middle years and the patriarch of an incredibly strong and
stable clan in his late years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning became a peerless
swordsman. His sword was the number one sword of the world, and his
speed surpassed everyone’s imaginations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he had
returned from his drifting adventures on the oceans was because he
wished to find his birth parents. Thanks to a medallion he had
carried with him his entire life, he finally discovered his parents.
When he was young, they had been pursued by a group of enemies and so
they were forced to abandon him in front of a rich family’s
doorstep. Eventually, his parents had found a place to hide. They had
quietly trained until they became incredibly powerful. They killed
their foes, then established a mountain villa and had many other
children and even grandchildren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right at this
moment, Ning finally came back to them as well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning became a
physician’s apprentice, earnestly following his master in the
practice of medicine. He lived a very ordinary life, and the
physician’s daughter ended up marrying him. His skill in medicine
eventually surpassed his master’s, and his fame and reputation
quickly spread throughout the world. Although he suffered the
occasional setback, with other physicians occasionally slandering
him, his influence within the world continued to only grow greater
and greater…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a fiend, a
true demon. His only ambition was to rule the entire world and force
all of its many denizens to prostrate themselves at his feet. All
schools and all sects had to bow before him… and those who refused
would perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiendish Ning set
up his own organization, and within its domain he was the master of
all. No one dared to violate his command! Slowly, his area of
influence began to spread as he wiped out the various other schools
and sects nearby. His reputation grew greater and greater, as did his
power. He became the undisputed hegemon amongst the countless evil
figures of the world, and in the final battle he slew the three
grandmasters of the righteous path. From that day forth, the entire
world fell under his demonic, despotic might. No one dared to disobey
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One life after another.
Each time, Ning lived a wonderful live. Even when he became a demonic
despot or a viledoer, he would end up becoming an invincible figure,
a leader amongst devils who none could shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The righteous path? The
evil path? An ordinary mortal? A rural nobleman? A robber baron? A
low-key sect farmer who was actually the number one expert in his
sect? A brilliant scholar who won the imperial exams and was given
the title of ‘zhuangyuan’? A down-on-his-luck scholar who
encountered a fox-fairy spirit?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each illusory life was
like a form of rebirth. In truth, all of the illusory worlds were
created by the Allworld Tribulation based on Ning’s own memories.
For example, becoming a ‘zhuangyuan’ was something exclusive to
the world of Earth in the Three Realms. Precisely because these
worlds were all created based on Ning’s own memories, they all
seemed very comfortable and familiar to Ning, making it easier for
him to be drawn deeper into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all so real. Too
real. Not only was it comparable to reincarnation, it was dimming his
Dao-heart and his will! An ordinary Samsara Daolord’s mind would’ve
long ago been fogged over by the endless illusions, and they would’ve
forgotten who they were and be forever trapped by the illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had come here
shortly after leaving the Three Realms, even he wouldn’t have been
able to withstand it. However, his will and his soul had been
tempered and shaped to be even more unshakeable than before. He was
always able to maintain at least a modicum of clarity. Although these
illusory worlds were very real and held both love and hate, family
and ambition and madness… Ning was always able to keep himself at
arm’s length. He wasn’t seduced or led astray by the illusions,
and his soul and his will watched in a detached manner as this all
proceeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy, Master
has spent far too much time in those illusions. It’s been nearly a
hundred thousand years. You’ve already become a Daolord of the
Third Step, but he’s still in the illusions!” Pillsaint and Su
Youji were next to each other within the cave, staring towards the
white-robed Hegemon’s corpse and the still-seated Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji gazed towards
Ning. “Master was able to make it all the way to the Hegemon’s
corpse. Clearly, these illusions aren’t able to do anything to him.
There’s no need for you to worry. Everything will be fine. Let us
wait a while longer. If something really does seem to be wrong, I’ll
go over there and pull him out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had broken
through as well. Her path had been that of the Dao of Charm and
illusions to begin with, and the white-robed Hegemon’s mastery over
illusions had indeed given her new insights and epiphanies. She had
gained a deeper understanding of the legacy of Feixian the Exalted,
and thus her rate of improvement began to accelerate rapidly. Thanks
to a temporal acceleration treasure, she finally managed to break
through to become a Daolord of the Third Step after nearly ten
million accelerated years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it hadn’t been for
the insights she had gained from the white-robed Hegemon’s
illusions, she probably would’ve taken ten times as long in order
to make this breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint remained a
Daolord of the Second Step. The battle-scars on the cave walls were
of very limited benefit to him. He was at a fairly low level of
insight, and as such the intent of a Hegemon’s Dao was mostly
inscrutable to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Naia and
Daolord Bruteflame, they were both Daolords of the Fourth Step. Both
of them continued to ardently study those Hegemonic battle-scars, as
they were of tremendous help to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After becoming a
Daolord of the Third Step, my soul has continuously increased in
power. Given my mastery over the art of illusions, I should be more
or less able to resist the remnant energy unleashed by the Hegemon’s
corpse,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Pillsaint’s
eyebrows suddenly lifted upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Su
Youji was startled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange aura suddenly
shot out from the distant, seated Ning. It was as though something
had just been given birth to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One life after another.
He threw himself into each life, allowing himself to experience love
and hate, life and death. Each life was a wonderful one, as the
illusions sought to drag Ning fully into that world and drown him
within its lies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, each time Ning
was always able to extricate himself. In the blink of an eye,
thousands of worlds and lifetimes had gone by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ve grown
weary of the red dust of the mortal world. I wish to dedicate myself
to the monastic life. Please accept me.” A white-robed youth was
kneeling in front of an old monk within a monastery. But right at
this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the entire
world suddenly started to shake. The white-robed youth was briefly
startled. He rose to his feet, scanning his surroundings. He looked
at the old monk, then looked at the mountains around him. The entire
world seemed to be within his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to put an
end to this unending cycle of reincarnation,” the white-robed youth
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world burst
apart, the illusions have completely collapsed. The world in front of
Ning became clear once more. He was still seated in the lotus
position within the cave, and roughly thirty meters up ahead of him
was the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse. Although the power of the
illusions remained as potent as ever, they were no longer able to
affect him in the slightest… because the sea of consciousness
within his mind had just undergone a fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful tidal wave
of heartforce shot out, drenching reality in its waters. Reality and
illusions twisted together, coalescing into a single spot of light.
This spot of light was almost like the Worldheart which every single
chaosworld was born from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spot of light began
to grow, and it seemed to contain a thousand planets within it. With
a rumbling sound, an entire universe began to manifest inside of it
as a new world was established.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This… this was his
heartworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce, stage six –
World!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mind and heart
had long ago been at the threshold of this level; all he needed was
some more experience and insights, and he would have made his
breakthrough. If it hadn’t been for this event, he probably
would’ve needed to experience many more things and see more worlds
before finally making his breakthrough. However, the endless illusory
worlds of the Allworld Tribulation had allowed him to finally see
through to the nature of reality. His heartforce vaulted over that
final barrier, allowing him to reach the sixth stage. He finally
established his own heartworld, a world where illusions and reality
intersected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heartworld was to
Heartforce Cultivators what the Jindan chaos region was to Ki
Refiners! Only if you could establish a heartworld would you be
considered a true Heartforce Cultivator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were incredibly
few true Heartforce Cultivators. The experiences Ning had undergone
in the Three Realms had given him tremendous mental fortitude, and he
had always had an incredibly high level of comprehension… but in
the end, he had still needed the Allworld Tribulation in order to
make the final breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
I am a Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ki Refiners train in
Immortal energy. They are skilled in secret arts and magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgods train in
their divine body. They are skilled in divine abilities and in using
weapons in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce
Cultivators establish heartworlds. They train in heartforce and know
many mysterious powers that can strike at an enemy’s heart, slaying
them with a thought.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
Ki Refiners and Fiendgods focused on reaching ever-higher levels of
mastery in the Dao. Heartforce Cultivators, however, were different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce Cultivators
did not focus on the strength of their Dao; rather, they focused on
the stability of their Dao. They needed extremely stable Daos and
extremely stable heartworlds, as only then could those heartworlds
continuously expand. The vaster a heartworld was, the more
terrifyingly powerful a Heartworld Cultivator would be! A Verge-level
Heartforce Cultivator could have a heartworld that was comparable in
size to an entire territory!

Chapter 36 – Heartforce Cultivator
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning turned and
left, quickly pulling away from the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji
spoke out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what
happened just now?” Pillsaint was very curious. Both of them had
sensed that unusual aura rippling out just now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded at them. “I
just established my heartworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld?” Both
Su Youji and Pillsaint revealed shocked looks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld?”
Daolord Naia and Daolord Bruteflame had been startled by the aura as
well, and they were also stunned when they heard Ning say these
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One only became a true
Heartforce Cultivator upon being able to establish a heartworld.
Heartforce Cultivators were incredibly rare! A powerful Daolord who
also trained as a Heartforce Cultivator? He would definitely be
dreaded by the vast majority of other Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning didn’t
hide it from them, because they were his retainers. In the future,
they’d be able to notice when he used his Heartforce Cultivator
abilities to kill his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not disturb me.”
Ning waved his hand, causing the temporal acceleration cottage to
appear. He then stepped into the cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Heartforce
Cultivator. Master has become a Heartforce Cultivator.” Su Youji
was rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-this is
incredible.” Pillsaint, Daolord Bruteflame, and Daolord Naia could
scarcely believe it. What none of them knew was that in the Three
Realms, Ning had actually been even more formidable in heartforce
than he had been in the Dao of the Sword. Even Subhuti had suspected
for a time that he had misjudged his disciple. Was it possible,
Subhuti had wondered, that his disciple was actually more suited to
the path of heartforce?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, he had finally
established his own heartworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the thatched
temporal cottage. Ning sat down in the lotus position. The task
before him was for him to fully construct the heartworld. The larger
the heartworld, the more powerful his heartforce would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The creation of a
heartworld was an extremely intricate task. When he had been next to
the white-robed Hegemon’s corpse, he had been constantly assaulted
by the illusions and so naturally chose to move away from its area of
influence before beginning this task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My own heartworld.”
With a thought, Ning began to visualize the heartworld inside
himself. Although it looked like nothing more than a tiny dot on his
forehead, it contained an entire world within itself. The amount of
space that could be held within that dot was theoretically limitless;
it was entirely possible for it to grow to become greater than even
the Badlands Territory. Ordinary Verge-level Heartforce Cultivators
would generally have heartworlds that were on par with an ordinary
territory in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to know
how powerful a heartforce cultivator was, you could find out by
looking at his heartworld. The heartworld of a master-class
World-level cultivator would merely be roughly comparable to a
chaosworld in size! However, Ning’s Dao was that of a Samsara
Daolord’s, and thus he was able to break through and make it far
larger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, his
heartworld was a blurry, foggy region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” A voice
rang out within the world, causing the mists to begin to vanish. A
continent began to emerge and spread out within the void, and a sky
began to appear above it which grew higher and higher…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, his
heartworld began to continuously draw in more and more chaos energy.
Ning’s chaos jewels continuously replenished his supply of power.
Relying on chaos energy from the outside world would be too slow, and
he had more than enough chaos jewels. The amount of chaos energy
needed to make this breakthrough was nothing to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the world halted
its expansion. The heart world was now over ten billion kilometers
wide, covering an absolutely enormous amount of space that was
comparable to a chaosworld. This entire world brimmed with sword-ki,
as this was a world of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grow further.”
Ning poured his first-stage Omega Sword Dago into the heart of this
heartworld, using it to try and further expand his heartworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the world
seemed to change in color and darken. The land mass at the very
center of the heartworld began to bulge upwards as the tallest
mountain within this world climbed ever-higher, stabbing like a sword
into the skies from within the very center. This enormous sword
emanated the aura of the Omega Sword Dao, and it was also the
physical representation of this Dao. It was now more than ten billion
kilometers tall, and the might of its aura washed out throughout the
heartworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heartworld
continued to expand at a furious pace, growing to be a hundred… a
thousand… ten thousand times larger than before. The rate at which
it was growing was truly staggering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
my Omega Sword Dao is quite well-suited for the creation of this
heartworld.” A figure suddenly appeared at the top of the enormous
sword-mountain. It was a white-robed Ning, formed by the
manifestation of his will. “A world created using the Omega Sword
Dao as the core is extremely stable, making it much easier for it to
grow and expand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. It finally hit
the limit.” Ning halted the expansion. This vast, endless world was
so great in size that Ning couldn’t even see to the end of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” Ning began
the final expansion, pouring his second-stage Omega Sword Dago into
the core of this world. The heartworld had already been terrifyingly
large in size, and now it grew even larger. The heavens grew vaster,
while the earth grew deeper. The world stretched outwards unto
infinity as the enormous sword-mountain increased in height as well.
It rumbled as it stretched upwards until it finally reached a height
of more than a hundred billion kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s chaos jewels
were being depleted at a furious pace as they provided sustenance for
his heartworld’s expansion. Thankfully, this wasn’t a real world,
and so the amount of chaos jewels used up was still fairly negligible
to Ning. If he had to create an enormous real world of this size,
even a hundred million cubes of chaos jewels would be far from
enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another period of
time passed, everything fell still once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-this is c-crazy
big…” Ning himself was shocked as his mental projection stood
there atop the giant sword-mountain, staring at this seemingly
infinitely large world. Thankfully, he was the creator of this
heartworld and knew everything within it… which was why he knew
that the heartworld was roughly comparable to a full territory in
size!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How vast was a normal
territory? You’d generally have to traverse it through relying on
spacetime transfer arrays. A single territory was far larger than the
entire Brightshore Kingdom! The Badlands Territory had roughly a
hundred thousand chaosworlds within it, but the chaosworlds were all
extremely distant from each other. As a result, the size of a
territory was truly staggering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
pointed off into the horizon, where a heavenly pillar suddenly began
to take form. “Arise.” Ning pointed to the other direction, with
yet another heavenly pillar taking shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here, Ning was able to
create anything at all with his will alone. Soon, five celestial
pillars had appeared at the ends of this vast world, and they
embodied his Blood Drop sword-intent, his Shadowless sword-art, his
Yin-Yang sword-intent, his Soleheart sword-intent, and his
Heavenbreaker sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth.” Ning
smiled as he stared off into the distance. The earth rumbled as chaos
nectar began to appear, quickly pooling together into a lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just laughed. He
knew that all of this was imaginary, not actual chaos nectar.
“According to the legends, when Heartforce Cultivators reach the
true apex, their heartworlds shall transform into true worlds. When
that happens, the treasures within their heartworld will become
actual treasures. If you form a heartforce Eternal weapon, that
Eternal weapon can be taken out from your heartworld and used in
combat. You could even create precious ingredients and make them
real,” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the goal of
every Heartforce Cultivator… however, thus far no one had ever been
able to accomplish it! In truth, the goal was absolutely ridiculous
and unbelievable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This heartworld formed
by his second-stage Omega Sword Dao was actually the size of an
entire territory. In truth, this stunned and delighted Ning
considerably, as only Verge-level Heartforce Cultivators were
supposed to be able to accomplish this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it made sense.
The heartworld didn’t really require a powerful Dao, it required a
stable one! The more stable the Dao, the better. The more stable the
Dao, the larger the heartworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
powerful Daolords who had incredibly powerful and fierce Daos, but
those Daos wouldn’t be a good fit for establishing a heartworld.
The toughness of a chain depended on the strength of the weakest
link! If a heartworld was to be stable, it couldn’t afford to have
any weak links at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Hearrtforce
Cultivators often wandered the universe, seeking ways to further
stabilize and perfect their Daos. When Ning had come up with five
Supreme Daos and linked them together, he had already formed an
extremely stable Dao. Now that he had truly fused them into a single
Dao, the Omega Sword Dao, he had created the most perfect and stable
Dao possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Omega Sword Dao was
not only a truly ultimate Dao, it was also the most stable of Daos!
It represented the absolute limit with regards to the Dao of the
Sword, and it had no flaws whatsoever. A mere second-stage Omega
Sword Dao was already comparable in stability to the Daos of many
Verge-level Heartforce Cultivators. The third stage of this Omega Dao
would most likely put Ning at a level comparable to the most supreme
Heartforce Cultivator Daolords in existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are
differences in power even amongst Verge-level Heartforce Cultivators.
Daolord Soleman, for example, is much weaker than the Palace Lord of
the Heartforce Palace,” Ning mused to himself. “Daolord
Featherdress, for example, was known as the most powerful Daolord of
the Endless Territories during his time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had first
been captured and sent to the Astral Islands, he had learned of the
ninety-nine legacies it held. The top-ranked legacy was the
heartforce legacy of Daolord Featherdress. Daolord Soleman couldn’t
compare to Daolord Featherdress in power; the later was once known as
the number one Daolord of the Endless Territories! It must be
remembered that not even the current Palace Lord of the Palace of the
Heart was ranked number one in all the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, there could be
great differences in power amongst Heartforce Cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Omega Sword Dao
is virtually flawless. The third stage might put me close to Daolord
Featherdress’ level.” Ning was delighted. In the past, Daolord
Featherdress’ legacy was useless to him… but now, he could make
use of those heartforce secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Heartforce
Cultivator, he was on roughly the same level as Daolord Soleman. Even
if he was a bit weaker, he wouldn’t be that much weaker. He could
be considered a second-tier Heartforce Cultivator Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In close combat, his
sword-arts and his Northbow swords ensured that he stood at the very
peak of power amongst second-tier Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you combined the
two…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that there were now very, very few Daolords who could match a freak
like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. After Ning became a Heartforce Cultivator, he began to train in
the terrifyingly powerful heartforce arts which Daolord Featherdress
had left behind. His heartworld was built around his Omega Sword Dao,
making his heartforce incredibly pure and possess strong offensive
powers. Daolord Featherdress’ legacy was a bit softer and more
subtle by comparison, and so Ning used the information he gained from
it to create some heartforce arts of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than sixty thousand additional years went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” A loud
laugh rang out as the Ninedust Sectlord emerged, appearing to be in
an excellent mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been
meditating silently within his temporal acceleration cottage. He now
opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Darknorth,
were you in training? I’m really sorry that the ancestor left no
legacies behind for you. You waited for me all this time for
nothing.” The Ninedust Sectlord smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you had a
fruitful experience.” Ning walked out of his cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ancestor’s
path was that of the Dao of Water, and he also used staff-arts. I
benefited greatly.” The Ninedust Sectlord was extremely smug.
“Jealous, Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe just a bit.”
Ning nodded. “This Patriarch of the Dao Alliance left something for
me as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Alliance?”
The Ninedust Sectlord turned his head, puzzled, to look towards the
white-robed Hegemon’s corpse. “That one over there? He left
something for you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But our Ancient
Hegemon took all of his treasures. There shouldn’t have been
anything left for you.” The Ninedust Sectlord was confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just shook his
head. If it hadn’t been for the white-robed Hegemon, it would’ve
taken Ning much, much longer to become a Heartforce Cultivator.
Although he had been at the cusp for some time, it was quite normal
for someone to remain on the cusp for a full chaos cycle or even
longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave,
Ninedust.” Ning waved his hand, collecting the distant Su Youji,
Pillsaint, Daolord Naia, and Daolord Bruteflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Ninedust Sectlord didn’t ask Ning about what he had gained. He
instead turned to look at the Universe treasure, that dark-red
longstaff, then said respectfully: “Senior, please send us away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A streak of
light flew out from the dark-red longstaff and transformed into the
bald, black-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth gave Ning a
long look. The Ninedust Sectlord had been undergoing the trials and
so did not know what had happened, but the youth knew exactly what
Ning had been up to. Darknorth of the Dao Alliance had actually
established his heartworld. The Universe weapon couldn’t help but
sigh. The Dao Alliance truly did have countless geniuses within its
ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send you
off,” the youth said. He waved his hand, causing a wave of power to
surround Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord.
