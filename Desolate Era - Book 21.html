Chapter 1 - The Mortal World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clatter, clatter,
clatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of many
hooves clattering against the ground could be heard as what looked
like a river of black steel flooded through the streets. Atop the
large, armor-clad horses were the black-armored knights, all of which
had frozen looks in their eyes. They looked as though they had come
back from Hell itself as they galloped towards the majestic, towering
castle at the end of the path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guards at the top
of the castle walls were rather drowsy, as things here had been
peaceful for far, far too long. Given the influence and power of
Tianxun Castle, how many would dare to cause trouble here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vibrations caused
by the distant, galloping horses caused one of the guards to take a
closer look off towards the distance. Torches were lit all around the
castle, and their light was dimly reflected off the armor of the
distant knights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
guard was shocked. Taking a closer look, he was able to tell that
there had to be at least a few hundred knights headed their way. His
face turned ashen with fear as he hurriedly picked up his warning
horn, then lifted it up high and blew it loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WUUUUUUUU!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deep, echoing
sounds of the horn instantly filled the entire castle. The castle
instantly turned into a hubbub of commotion as many armored warriors
charged out from within it. Quite a few women and children were
awakened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the walls became
filled with many armored warriors, all of whom had solemn looks on
their faces. Many of them were filled with savage, murderous auras as
well; clearly, these were valiant figures that had seen and spilled
blood before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone blew the
warning horn? It’s been a long, long time since our Tianxun Castle
has used the warning horn.” A gray-robed, white-bearded old man
ascended the castle walls as well, escorted by a group of people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three levels
of alerts that could be used to notify Tianxun Castle of danger.
Blowing the warning horn represented the highest level of danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone would dare
to cause trouble for our Tianxun Castle? Hmph.” Next to him was a
muscular, scar-faced man. The scar-faced man sneered, “I want to
see for myself who could be so audacious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, fifth brother.
Let’s take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of men escorted
a white-bearded old man to the walls, all of them staring far off
into the distance. And as they did…their faces all began to change.
The mounted knights were now much closer than before, and the lead
knights were actually beginning to slow down as they were within
three hundred meters of the walls. The appearances of the knights
could be seen clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystice Knights?”
The white-bearded old man narrowed his eyes. He murmured to himself
softly, “Why have Mystice Knights come here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystice Knights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are a total of
thirty thousand Mystice Knights, and around three thousand of them
have come before us. Only one of their commanders has the authority
to lead so many Mystice Knights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, what should
we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of men all
looked at the white-bearded old man, who was the lord of this castle.
The white-bearded old man frowned, then said in a low voice, “Our
Tianxun Castle might be capable of defeating these Mystice Knights if
we fought with all our might, but our casualties would be utterly
devastating…and we would anger the one who created the Mystice
Knights as well…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, then we…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our only choice is
to come up with a way to have them voluntarily depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thundering
hoofsteps of the three thousand Mystice Knights continued to ring out
as they began to gather in front of Castle Tianxun. Soon, all of the
knights came to a halt. The leader was a commander dressed in silver
armor who had a gray mask on his face. Only his eyes could be seen,
and he stared at the white-bearded old man atop the walls as he said
calmly, “Li Tianxun, the day of your death has come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Death?” The faces
of those atop the walls of Castle Tianxun became quite unsightly.
These words showed that clearly, this matter wouldn’t be so easily
resolved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander, might I
ask how I offended you?” The white-bearded old man chuckled as he
spoke, his voice echoing forth throughout the world. He was a peak
Xiantian expert, after all. “My sworn brother’s eldest disciple,
‘Immortal Omniscient’, is currently residing within my castle. I
would suggest that you leave this place. If you disturb Immortal
Omniscient, you would have committed a grave sin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Omniscient?
I’m supposed to believe he is here, just because you say he is?”
The silver-armored knight said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man immediately called out, “Immortal Omniscient!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle, you can just
address me as Omniscient. There’s no need to address me as
‘Immortal’.” A streak of light flew out from the city walls. It
was an azure-robed man standing atop a flying sword. A cold wind blew
past, rustling his robes. He stood there atop the sword, drifting
downwards from the skies, causing all the guards atop Castle Tianxun
to grow excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystice Knights.”
The azure-robed man looked downwards, then said calmly, “There’s
no real disputes between my Transheaven Palace and the Mystice
Knights. I think it would be best if you leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is here…”
the silver-armored knight growled softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We of Castle Tianxun
do not know how we offended the Mystice Knights. Later, I will
definitely send people to deliver gifts in recompense.” The
white-bearded old man still had that yielding, accommodating smile on
his face. Neither the Mystice Knights nor Transheaven Palace were
powers he could afford to offend!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The general’s
guess was right on.” The silver-armored commander continued in a
low voice, “Elders, sorry to trouble you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave that kid
Omniscient to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of light
flew out from within the ranks of the Mystice Knights. It was two of
the armored knights, but their auras suddenly exploded with power
that was greater than even Immortal Omniscient’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elders of the
Mystice Knights?” The azure-robed man had been flying forward
calmly atop his sword, but his face now instantly changed. It was
known that the Mystice Knights had a total of ten commanders, each of
which could control three thousand knights…but the truth was a bit
more complicated than that. Strictly speaking, these thirty thousand
knights were nothing more than the disciples under the general’s
tutelage, with the better ones being promoted to become lieutenants,
captains, and commanders. Commanders were generally all at the peak
Xiantian level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If however they were
able to break through again and reach the Zifu level, they would no
longer be required to serve as military commanders. They would become
elders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Elder was,
in truth, a former commander. The most terrifying figures of the
Mystice Knights were its elders and its general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transheaven Palace
and the Mystice Knights…” Immortal Omniscient began frantically.
All of the Zifu Disciples of the Mystice Knights had risen to power
through countless battles. Each and every one of them was terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transheaven
Palace…no longer exists.” Both of the elders spoke out as they
flew into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Immortal
Omniscient’s face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go join them in the
tomb.” Accompanying these words was an attack, as one of the elders
sent a a streak of curved, bloody moonlight towards Immortal
Omniscient. The battle instantly erupted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” The
silver-armored knight immediately gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Castle Tianxun had
already begun to panic. Two Immortals had suddenly emerged from
within the ranks of the Mystice Knights, causing them to lose all of
their courage. With a single boom, the gates to the city were blasted
open. Given the power of the Mystice Knights, breaking through the
gate of a castle was far too easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slaughter instantly
began.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mystice Knights had
made their preparations long ago. The terrified guards of Castle
Tianxun were far from being a match for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!” A
terrified, fleeing woman was chopped to death by one blow of a saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother! Mother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m gonna kill
you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One by one, the
children were wiped out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Castle Tianxun was
transformed into a river of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man had gone completely berserk, but he was unable to prevent it from
happening. He roared angrily, “Even if the Mystice Knights have
launched a war against Transheaven Palace, why do act you against
Castle Tianxun as well? How has Castle Tianxun offended you?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why? Tianxun, you
old wretch, do you still remember me?” The silver-armored
commander, who had fought with the greatest degree of savagery,
removed his mask, revealing a hideous, scar-covered face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
white-bearded old man didn’t recognize him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you’ve
done so many evil deeds that you’ve forgotten. Do you remember that
night, thirty-nine years ago, when you left behind one wound after
another on the face of a child?” The silver-armored knight’s
voice was filled with boundless hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…didn’t you
die?!” The white-bearded man was a peak Xiantian expert, after all;
he naturally was able to quickly remember the events of that night,
and he couldn’t help but stare in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes…it would’ve
been best for you if I died. But I did not. Although I lost a great
deal of blood, I didn’t die. I’m not the type to die as easily as
that. I crawled out, alive, from that pile of corpses…and when I
woke up, I found that I was the only survivor out of our tribe of
thirty thousand. I survived…but my life was a life worse than
death. That day, I swore an oath that I would one day destroy Castle
Tianxun. I changed my name to ‘Bloodfeud’. Step by solitary step,
I advanced through life…and now, I’ve become the general’s
personal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” The
white-bearded old man’s heart shook as he stared at this man, whose
face covered with savage scars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the power of the
Mystice Knights, they could’ve easily fixed this commander’s face
long ago. However, he had chosen not to; clearly, it was due to him
nursing this hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually managed
to tie yourself to Transheaven Palace…but alas for you, after
seeing the hatred festering in my heart for so long, one day Master
finally asked me about it, and so I told him. Master’s response
was… “Then we might as well wipe out Transheaven Palace. The
death of the Lord of Transheaven Palace will be a good thing for the
world.” The silver-armored knight continued to fight, drawing
closer and closer to the white-bearded old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man had never imagined that he was actually the reason why the
general of the Mystice Knights had attacked Transheaven Palace. All
of the knights of the Mystice Knights were madmen, and the general
who had founded their order was the number one madman in the world.
No one dared to antagonize him. Even Transheaven Palace was doomed to
be destroyed, now that they had.
</P>

Chapter 2 - Understanding the Heart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the general
of the Mystice Knights had taken a dislike towards Transheaven Palace
for quite some time now. This was nothing more than a final,
motivating spark. The general really did like his disciple,
‘Bloodfeud’; he felt that Bloodfeud was his perfect successor.
Bloodfeud was extremely talented, but had been held back by his
hatred. Once he gained his vengeance, Bloodfeud would probably
undergo a true transformation, rising like a phoenix from a pile of
ashes. Thus, he decided to wipe out Transheaven Palace at one blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee! Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as I
survive, the Li clan will remain.” Upon seeing what was happening,
the white-bearded old man no longer had any more will to fight, and
he immediately began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
knight, in turn, slaughtered through all who attempted to oppose him,
doing his very best to close the range. Morale began to plummet as
the guardians of Castle Tianxun saw their lord begin to flee, and
they began to flee as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mystice Knights
began an absolute massacre of the survivors. Bloodfeud’s order was
for them to kill everyone here, leaving none behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Li Tianxun, stop
fighting.” An ancient voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of light
flew towards him from far away. It was the two elders…and behind
them, the corpse of Immortal Omniscient fell towards the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man stared in despair at the two armored elders who had appeared in
the air in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfeud, he’s
yours,” one of the elders said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Elder.”
The silver-armored knight walked forward, filled with a murderous
aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world suddenly
turned silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the cries, the
shouts, the screams, the begs for mercy, the sobs…they all
vanished. It was completely silent now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mystice Knight
stabbing a spear through the air…the mother crouched in front of
her child, blocking sabers and swords for him…the silver-armored
knight whose eyes were filled with hatred…the two calm elders in
the air…all of them had looks of utter shock in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They realized…that
they were completely unable to move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the two elders
in midair could move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” A single
sigh echoed within the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed youth
suddenly appeared in the distance. He had been watching from far
away, but with a single step he arrived in the air above Castle
Tianxun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
utterly terrified, including the silver-armored knight and the two
elders. Not even their general, who was said to be one of the top
three experts of the entire world, was even close to being as
terrifying as this black-robed youth. The black-robed youth stood
there, and it seemed as though he had become the center of this
entire world. The world itself seemed to shudder at his presence, as
though he could effortlessly destroy it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the leader
of these knights?” The black-robed Ji Ning stood in front of the
white-bearded old man and the silver-armored knight, aiming his
question at the knight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The knight suddenly
realized that he could now speak. He nodded. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the leader
of this castle?” Ning looked at the white-bearded old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man also realized that he could now speak. He immediately said,
“Senior, the Mystice Knights destroyed my clan and murdered
countless innocents. Please give me justice, senior!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards the
silver-armored knight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? He wants
‘justice’? The entirety of Castle Tianxun is a den of devils. All
of them deserve to die.” The silver-armored knight’s eyes were
filled with hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did a quick scan
of their souls, quickly sorting through the memories of the
silver-armored knight and the white-bearded old man. He now
completely understood the istuation, as well as how much hatred this
silver-armored knight held in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Castle Tianxun
has brought blessings to many. Although we are many in number,
resulting in the occasional evildoer appearing, you can ask anyone
you like about our reputation, senior.” The white-bearded old man
knew that this youth before him was his only hope for survival, and
tears began to flow out of his eyes. “Damn these Mystice Knights.
They didn’t even spare the children.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need to
discuss your ‘reputation’.” Ning glanced at the white-bearded
old man, his gaze very calm. “Lord of Castle Tianxun…leader of
Blackwind Cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man’s face turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. Blackwind
Cave was indeed a secret identity of Castle Tianxun. Every single
male child would be trained, and in fact from the age of three they
would be taught to kill. However, as the saying goes, a rabbit
doesn’t eat the grass around his hole. It was true that in the
surrounding area, Castle Tianxun’s reputation was sterling, and
they had indeed done many good deeds. But in other places…they were
the utterly vile and rapacious Blackwind Cave! They had robbed and
murdered countless people, which was why Castle Tianxun was so
wealthy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But very few knew this
secret!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason
Bloodfeud knew the secret was because he was one of their victims.
After he became a Mystice Knight, he learned the full truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them deserve
to die. All of them!” The silver-armored knight said demonically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the children?
The women who have never killed a single soul? Those infants who are
still dressed in swaddling clothes?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pull up grass by the
roots.” The silver-armored knight looked at Ning. “I know you are
strong, senior. I’ve already taken my revenge. If you wish to kill
me or punish me, that’s entirely up to you. I only ask that the
others not be implicated as a result. My brothers in the Mystice
Knights only attacked because of my orders. I’ve been gripped by
hatred for countless years. Now that I’ve taken revenge…I’m
satisfied.” The silver-armored knight stood there resolutely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, and all of the children and women within Castle Tianxun were
drawn into a minor world estate-treasure which Ning kept with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning himself
vanished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Everyone
sensed that they were now able to move again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t kill
me?” The silver-armored knight was momentarily stunned, but he then
fell to his knees and kowtowed solemnly thrice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
white-bearded old man, he was completely and truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two elders had
solemn looks on their faces. They hurriedly urged the silver-armored
knight, “Bloodfeud, hurry up and deal with Li Tianxun. We need to
leave this place right away and report today’s events to the
general.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
silver-armored knight nodded, then immediately strode forward. The
white-bearded old man closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sssssshnk. The spear
stabbed forward, piercing through the white-bearded old man’s
chest, then retracted. As it did, blood spurted out. The
white-bearded old man opened his eyes as his body fell powerlessly to
the ground…and then he began to laugh wildly. Moments later…all
signs of life fled his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the three thousand Mystice Knights immediately departed from this
place under cover of night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The amount of hatred
and evil within the Three Realms is becoming greater and greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning wandered this
world, he could sense that this entire world was filled with hatred
and vileness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His two clones had
already spent more than 160 years in Undermoon Lake. He had no way of
finding out or sensing what had happened within Undermoon Lake, but
he was still certain that they were alive. If one died, the other
clones would immediately sense it and be able to recreate it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, your
priority is rescuing your wife. There’s no need for you to take
part in the Realmwars for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, my wife is
my wife, while the war is the war. These are two separate things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. When
the final war for karmic luck begins, we’ll have you take part. As
for now? You won’t have much of an impact on the overall situation,
so you should focus on your training. Fuxi, Suiren, and the others
all view you with great favor. If you can become a True God or
Daofather before the Endwar, you’ll be of true assistance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the words
which Subhuti had said to Ning. Ever since then, Ning had roamed the
Three Realms. He had seen many things in his travels. The Realmwars
came one after the other, and the Seamless Gate grew increasingly
berserk in his actions. Due to their increasing degree of influence,
even the mortals were greatly impacted as all sorts of murders,
feuds, and unjust acts grew increasingly common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had seen too many
things. He understood that in truth, all of this was due to the
provocations of the Seamless Gate, which sought to transform the
previous days of peace into utter chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate
delighted in chaos. But in a time of chaos, the lives of ordinary
mortals were like grass to be trampled upon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Ning had
always felt that children were innocent. When he had been young, he
had tortured to death a member of the Riverside clan for the sake of
avenging Spring Grass, but he had spared the man’s child,
‘Riverside Cai’. Want revenge? Grow powerful and come after me!
But in the end, that child Cai had only been able to become a Zifu
Disciple…and then, Cai had died in the chaos the Seamless Gate had
created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw mortals in all
their states. He saw through their small kindnesses and their petty
feuds, their grudges and their gratefulness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t explain
how it made him feel, but he could sense that his heart was slowly
transforming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was seated in the lotus position atop a stone that was located at the
very peak of an ordinary mountain. In front of him hovered a Goldstar
Bead of the Heavens, divine runes flickering atop its surface. Ning
spent most of his time analyzing the [Five Treasures] and the Nine
Chaos Seals. By comparing and contrasting the two, he was able to
gain insights faster. In order to study the Nine Chaos Seals, he had
to view the goldstar beads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly,
Ning sensed something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a dazzling
horde of stars seemed to appear in the air as all 3600 goldstar beads
emerged. As Ning sent out his Immortal energy, they began to glow
brightly, the divine runes on their surface changing nonstop. Slowly,
arcane auras began to manifest above each of the goldstar beads,
causing them to emit auras of incredible profundity.

Chapter 3 - The Mirrors of Heaven
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single goldstar
bead’s aura was now far more powerful than before. It was as though
they had evolved somehow…and the reason was because Ji Ning had
just mastered the second of the Nine Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How truly
extraordinary. It supports and reinforces the [Five Treasures]
sword-art, and is even more profound.” After mastering the second
chaos seal, Ning could immediately sense how extraordinary these nine
seals truly were. “If I had those two clones each bring a goldstar
bead into Undermoon Lake and meditate on it, it most likely would’ve
been beneficial to them in their quest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely
difficult to completely memorize all nine of the Nine Chaos Seals.
Daoist Three Purities had spent an enormous amount of effort before
succeeding, and had only been able to master seven of the seals.
Prior to becoming a World God, Mother Nuwa had only been able to
master eight of the seals. There was simply no way that Ning could
possibly memorize these incredibly profound and arcane chaos seals;
he had to keep the goldstar beads by his side in order to train in
them. The reason why he hadn’t taken them into Undermoon Lake was
because he was afraid that if he died in Undermoon Lake, the beads
would be lost as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if just a single
one of the 3600 beads was lost, the set would become incomplete and
there would be no way for them to join together into the Thirty-Six
Heavens in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Form.” The
black-robed Ning willed it, and the 3600 dazzling goldstar beads in
the skies joined together, rapidly merging into 360 stars, then
further merging together into the Thirty-Six Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thirty-Six Heavens
hoverered around Ning, and Ning could vaguely sense that were somehow
connecting to the workings of fate. Ning had a sudden thought, and he
immediately barked out, “Change!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The thirty-six
dazzling, glowing globes suddenly transformed into a series of
ancient, unadorned mirrors. These mirrors all had bronze borders to
them. Some of the mirrors had stellar diagrams of the sun and the
moon on the bronze, while others had diagrams of fish, bugs, birds,
and other beasts on them. Others were covered with flowers, trees,
and other vegetation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single mirror
seemed quite extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
carefully at these thirty-six levitating bronze mirrors with
curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thirty-Six Heavens
could transform into anything. The reason why they had changed into
mirrors just now was because Ning had mastered the second chaos seal.
Upon doing so, Ning felt a vague, hidden connection between them and
the hidden workings of fate, and so he allowed them to go with the
flow and transform as they pleased…and they became mirrors. Their
current appearance was the most suitable appearance for unleashing
the power of the Thirty-Six Heavens when using the second chaos seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Immortal
energy quickly filled into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
works. They are actually able to scry the workings of fate itself,”
Ning murmured to himself. “They can view the past, the present…and
the future?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There weren’t many
treasures in the Three Realms that were capable of touching upon the
workings of fate, but there were a few. The number one such treasure
was the Book of Life and Death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Book of Life and
Death was one of the most mysterious, arcane treasures that existed.
It recorded the details of the past and present lives of countless
living creatures. It was capable of recording hundreds or even
thousands of lives for each person. The Book of Life and Death was so
powerful that just by scribbling a few extra markings onto it, a
person who was destined to live just thirty years could instead be
given a lifespan of three hundred years! It could be used to
effortlessly change the workings of fate. It truly was an utterly
heaven-defying treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Court,
Buddhist Sangha, Daoist Path, and the Three Sovereigns all had
treasures of their own that could also scry on the workings of fate.
They had also developed various fate-scrying methods and techniques
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another example was the
‘Stone of Three Lives’ that lay by the side of the River of
Forgetfulness. The Stone of Three Lives was similarly capable of
illuminating the past, present, and future lives of a person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Thirty-Six
Heavens are quite similar to the Stone of Three Lives.” Ning nodded
slowly. “If that’s the case…then since it has the appearance of
mirrors, let them be known as the Mirrors of the Heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
fate-scrying treasures in the Three Realms, and each of them had been
created by major powers. This was the first time that an Empyrean
God/True Immortal like Ji Ning had acquired a treasure like this. But
of course, Ning hadn’t created it on his own; he didn’t have that
ability! He had relied on on the power of the Nine Chaos Seals,
unconsciously applying them through the goldstar beads and
transforming them into the Mirrors of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are capable of
scanning one’s past, present, and future. In addition, these
thirty-six mirrors are shaped like rectangles; they are perfect for
defense. In fact, it should even be possible to use them to reflect
an enemy’s attacks.” Ning carefully expected his treasures,
quickly coming to this conclusion regarding their uniqueness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, the
goldstar beads had mainly been useful because of their extremely high
quality, which was why Ning would use them in the form of various
weapons. But now, thanks to the chaos seals, they had gained certain
special powers as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After mastering the
second chaos seal, Ning continued to wander the Three Realms as he
had before. He watched many mortals, seeing their joys, their
sorrows, their farewells, their reunions, their love, their hate,
their debts, their grudges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Love…love was the
hardest one to truly fathom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No expert, no matter
how powerful, would be able to claim that he had truly transcended
beyond this word, ‘love’. Ning couldn’t, despite having
mastered the fourth stage of heartforce. Not even Houyi, who had
mastered the fifth stage of heartforce, could make that claim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year passed after
the other. Ning continued to wander the vast world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering palace began
to collapse as a flood of hatred, malevolence, and death energy
soared into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two armies of Immortal
cultivators were battling each other, as were many mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this what things
have come to on the eve of apocalypse?” The midair Ning stared
downwards at the slaughter proceeding. He shook his head. He
couldn’t, wouldn’t get involved. This sight was incredibly common
these days in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who can compare to
the Seamless Gate when it comes to manipulating the hearts of men?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why must they cause
the entire Three Realms to be thrown into such a state of turmoil?”
Ning felt quite powerless. Not even the major powers could stop this,
to say nothing of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he stopped this
particular battle, as soon as he left the war would continue. During
his journey across the Three Realms, Ning had long ago discovered
that all of these disputes were caused by the secret machinations of
the Seamless Gate. Aside from the more mundane methods of incitement
they used, the Seamless Gate had a particularly powerful tool at
their disposal…the Heavenly Dao of Heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Chaosworld
had originally had six Heavenly Daos; the Heavenly Daos of Earth,
Fire, Water, Wind, Heart, and Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Chaosworld
had ten Heavenly Daos; the Heavenly Daos of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire,
Earth, Yin, Yang, Destruction, Life, and Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But then, the
Primordial Era had come to an end. Under the guidance of Mother Nuwa,
the Three Realms was founded using the Pangu Chaosworld and its Daos
as the foundation. The Heaven Realm, for example, had originally been
one of the largest surviving pieces of the Pangu chaosworld. The
Pangu Chaosworld had served as the core, while the Seamless
Chaosworld had been used as a support structure. Thus, the Heavenly
Daos remained those of the Pangu Chaosworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result there was
no way to, for example, truly understand and master the Heavenly Dao
of Wind. The Three Realms had a flawed Heavenly Dao of Wind that had
been divided up into many different Grand Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Dao of
Heart similarly no longer existed in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, of the major
powers of the Seamless Chaosworld who had been alive during the old
days, such as the Godking, quite a few had very high levels of
attainment in the Heavenly Dao of Heart. They were tremendously
skilled in manipulating the hearts of men. With but a single gaze,
they could cause some ordinary Immortal cultivators to immediately
fall to their knees and willingly become slaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
many who had gained insight into the Heavenly Dao of Heart early on,
including many who were Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. They used
their many clones to cause trouble throughout the Three Realms, and
there was nothing the Nuwa Alliance could do about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten years. A hundred
years. Three hundred years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation in the
Three Realms had become increasingly dire. The chaos in the mortal
worlds was just a minor matter; the real problems lay in the repeated
Realmwars between the Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance! In the
beginning, Realmwars only occurred every so often, but now they
became increasingly frequent and increasingly deadly as both sides
grew more and more berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals began to perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six hundred years had
passed since the two clones had entered Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shout could be heard
echoing from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated atop a
wooden boat, allowing it to be carried forward by the waters of the
river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the shout,
Ning raised his to look. A long-haired man dressed in loose robes was
walking through the air towards him from far away. He had been far
away just a moment ago, but in the next instant he appeared before
Ning’s wooden boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Luoshui.” Ning pulled out a flask of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why didn’t you let
me know that you came to my place?” The long-haired man laughed as
he sat down. This was True Immortal Luoshui, the controller of this
world, the Luoshui major world. He was the disciple of Exalted
Celestial Carefree, a True Immortal who had found his Dao during the
Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few old
friends have died. I really wasn’t in the mood to pay a call.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, True
Immortal Luoshui couldn’t help but shake his head and sigh as well.
“True. Especially during the past three centuries. More and more
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals have died. Quite a few old drinking
buddies of mine have died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what he knew,
during the past six centuries since his two clones had entered
Undermoon Lake, the Nuwa Alliance had lost more than 1300 Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals! As for the Seamless Gate, they had lost more
than 1000 as well! The number of Celestial Immortals and Loose
Immortals who had died…that number was truly incalculable. Although
the casualties in each Realmwar weren’t that great, there had been
many, many Realmwars by now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn the Seamless
Gate.” True Immortal Luoshui ground his teeth. “They are simply
too despicable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed.” Ning’s
face sank as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
actions were simply contemptible! They actually acted in merciless
fashion against the family members and loved ones of the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals of the Three Realms! For example, if they
discovered that a True Immortal had a child, the Seamless Gate would
send people to assassinate that child! An Empyrean God had just two
disciples? The Seamless Gate would assassinate them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
seeks to drive our Empyrean Gods and True Immortals mad. Ideally,
they would go completely insane and die in their madness.” True
Immortal Luoshui said furiously, “Even if they don’t go insane,
they can be driven so berserk that they will seek out vengeance in
such a way that leads to their deaths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For ordinary True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods, to act alone in seeking vengeance upon
the Seamless Gate was akin to committing suicide. Not everyone had as
many powerful tools as Ning did! Only by staying calm and relying on
the support of an army of other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals a
Realmwar would they have a chance to win. The angrier they became,
the easier it would be for them to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
achieving victory, the Seamless Gate would stoop to anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning had
placed his daughter Brightmoon within the Crescent major world.
Otherwise, she probably would’ve suffered an attack as well. These
large-scale assassination programs the Seamless Gate had initiated
had driven the Nuwa Alliance utterly furious. This was one of the
reasons why the Realmwars were occurring nonstop now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All those years ago,
when the Lord of All Fiends brought back the Seamless Gate survivors,
we should’ve refused to let them in.” True Immortal Luoshui
ground his teeth. “Better to have fought then than to have allowed
them back into the Three Realms. Now, they rooted themselves firmly
here, growing increasingly powerful…and they have used that power
to deliver us a vicious bite.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But who could’ve
imagined all this?” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. No one was
ready for any of this. We actually addressed many of the Seamless
Gate as ‘brother’, and some were lifelong friends of mine. We
even traded many of our techniques for theirs, resulting in them
learning quite a few of our powerful techniques.” True Immortal
Luoshui shook his head. “We didn’t try to prevent them from
recruiting apprentices from our ranks either, resulting in them
gaining large numbers of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s far too late
to be saying these things now. All we can do is prepare for the war.
Let all of this be decided on the field of battle,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The wars are
becoming increasingly larger in size and scope. In a hundred years,
or perhaps a thousand years at most, the final war for karmic luck
will most likely begin,” True Immortal Luoshui said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final war for
karmic luck…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That would be one of
the last great battles before the end. All the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals would enter this final battle that would truly decide the
war for karmic luck. In fact, if the losing side felt that things
were going worse than expected, they might immediately launch the
Endwar, resulting in all the major powers attacking! All the
surviving major powers would then engage the final, true Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, from the looks
of things, this final battle would happen anywhere from a hundred to
a thousand years from now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Yesterday,
True Immortal Dongyan of your Grand Xia died in battle.” True
Immortal Luoshui looked at Ning. “Did you hear this news?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Dongyan?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 - Yellow Emperor Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus belonged to
the Dongyan clan. During the Crimsonbright Realmwar, True Immortal
Dongyan had battled alongside Ji Ning for many years. Ning and True
Immortal Dongyan naturally became quite close friends, and in his
heart, Ning felt tremendous admiration and respect for True Immortal
Dongyan, due to the way Dongyan acted and treated others. Dongyan was
a truly honorable, just, and upright man, a true hero. However, Ning
could tell that True Immortal Dongyan always seemed to have a hidden
sorrow buried within his heart. Most likely, something that happened
long ago which True Immortal Dongyan had never been able to fully
recover from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Dongyan of your Grand Xia was quite an admirable person,” True
Immortal Luoshui said with a sigh. “The Crimsonbright Realmwar
ended long ago, which meant that the Seamless Gate had far fewer
clashes against the Crimsonbright Realm. However, battles would still
occasionally break out, and True Immortal Dongyan fought at the very
front of almost every single battle. He was extraordinarily powerful,
resulting in him killing two Empyrean Gods/True Immortals of the
Seamless Gate. However, this time he was unlucky…he was surrounded
by three Empyrean Gods/True Immortals of the Seamless Gate, and he
wasn’t able to escape…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been six hundred
years. Early on, when Ning had heard of the deaths of his friends, he
felt pain in his heart. Later on, however, as more and more of them
died, Ning was able to stay calm despite his grief. This was because
he knew that this was a war that no one would be able to avoid or
escape from…and in war, there would always be casualties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To prevent people from
dying, there was only one solution — Win the war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A voice
suddenly rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come to Mount
Innerheart right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A spatial whirlpool
suddenly appeared directly in front of the wooden boat. True Immortal
Luoshui, still on the boat, was a bit puzzled upon seeing this. Ning
immediately explained, “Master has summoned me. I need to leave
immediately. Please pardon the abruptness, fellow Daoist Luoshui.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and go, go!
Don’t mind me,” True Immortal Dongshui said hurriedly. Ning was
now powerful enough that his status as a disciple of Subhuti had long
ago become widespread. The reason why Subhuti had forbidden Ning from
telling others in the past was because he was concerned that when
other experts knew of Ning’s true status, they would all do their
best to curry favor with Ning and befriend him for the sake of giving
Subhuti face. That would make it so that it would be very difficult
for Ning to be truly tempered and tested while wandering the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Subhuti’s
standard plan for training disciples. In the beginning, Subhuti would
not permit them to say that he was their master, unless he gave
explicit permission. Only when they became powerful experts of the
Three Realms would they be allowed to make it public.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning
immediately flew into the spatial whirlpool. He didn’t spend too
much time traversing through it before arriving at the air above
Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately landed
before the Daoist monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.” The
two guards at the entrance, Clearwater and Whiteriver, both smiled as
they welcomed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
stepped into the Daoist monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering, Ning
was quite surprised to see that far off into the distance, not only
was the white-haired Subhuti seated in the lotus position, more than
ten of his disciples were seated below him as well. All of them were
at the Empyrean God/True Immortal level. His third
apprentice-brother, Goldcrow, had made a rare appearance. Silvermoon
and Lord Jiang, who he was quite familiar with, were here as well.
Other members included senior apprentice-sister Empyrean Phoenix and
senior apprentice-brother Junwu, who he had met just a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly walked
over, choosing a place to sit down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, have
Redsnow come out,” Subhuti instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Ning
nodded, immediately notifying Empyrean God Redsnow, who was in the
Starseizer world, to come out. A short while later, Redsnow appeared
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone is here
now.” Subhuti looked downwards at his disciples, then said calmly,
“You should all know that ever since the assassinations the
Seamless Gate carried out three centuries ago, battles have
continuously raged between us and the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone, Ning
included, was enraged at the mention. Even mortals knew the principle
of not getting family members involved, but the Seamless Gate had
shown no scruples at all; they had launched a massive, Three
Realms-wide assassination program! The Seamless Gate knew very well
that this sort of assassination program could only be carried out
once; after the first time, the Nuwa Alliance would be on their guard
and give them no further chances. Thus, they made the program en
enormous one. Although the Nuwa Alliance had many experts, they had
been caught off-guard and so many had suffered catastrophic losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The family members,
friends, and beloved disciples of many experts of the Nuwa Alliance
had died miserable deaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, twelve Pure
Yang True Immortals of the Nuwa Alliance had been so enraged by what
had happened that they had gone completely insane, resulting in them
losing control of their power and thus losing their lives as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single member of
the Nuwa Alliance had been enraged by this. The Three Emperors of
Mankind and the two leaders of Daoism and Buddhism knew that there
was no way they could suppress the rage of their followers…and so
war had erupted on a massive scale. The number of wars that had
occurred during these three centuries was more than ten times as many
as the wars that had occurred in the previous three centuries! Almost
all of the Realms had experienced Realmwars by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The vast majority of
the Realms in the Three Realms have experienced Realmwars now. Only a
very small number of truly top-tier Realms have been able to just
barely keep the peace,” Subhuti said. “And now, the place where
the next Realmwar shall erupt…is the Yellow Emperor Realm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yellow Emperor
Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Yellow Emperor
of the Five Emperors?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Realms of most True
Gods and Daofathers were fairly ordinary in strength, with a realm
that possessed a hundred Empyrean Gods/True Immortals to be a fairly
powerful one. Ning and the others all understood that the scale of
the wars was increasing in size, and they weren’t surprised that
this Realmwar would be occurring within a Realm belonging to someone
on the level of the Five Emperors. They had expected a war like this
to occur for quite some time now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…they didn’t
expect that it would be the Realm of the Yellow Emperor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yellow Emperor was
someone who held an extremely exalted status in human history. The
human race was first unified by the Three Emperors: Suiren, Fuxi, and
Shennong. The next to rise to power was the first of the Five
Emperors, Xuan Yuan the Yellow Emperor! In fact, long ago Shennong,
then known as the Flame Emperor, had battled against the Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan for an extremely long period of time. Although
Shennong was very powerful, he primarily focused his efforts on
alchemy rather than leading his armies. Thus…in the end, he was
actually defeated! It was the Yellow Emperor who won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even in the Primordial
Era, the human race would thus refer to themselves as the ‘scions
of the flame and the yellow.’ 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It can be said that in
terms of his influence on the human race, the Yellow Emperor was
supreme amongst the Five Emperors. Although in the end, it was Yu the
Great who established and solidified the imperial clan of humanity
which had persisted to this very day, in terms of personal charisma
and military prowess, Yu the Great was actually inferior to the
Yellow Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu the Great is the
leader of the Primordial Imperial Clan. When the Primordial Imperial
Clan gives the order, all the clans of the human race shall join
together under their banner. They will definitely be saved for the
final war for karmic luck.” Empyrean Phoenix was puzzled. “But of
the four remaining monarchs, Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, Zhuanxu, and
the Yellow Emperor…Xuan Yuan the Yellow Emperor is definitely the
most powerful of the four. More than a thousand Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals are by his side at all times. His Realm is
considerably more powerful than the Realms of Emperor Zhuanxu,
Emperor Yao, and Emperor Shun. Why has war broken out in his Realm
instead?” 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
knew that the likes of Emperor Zhuanxu only had six hundred or so
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under their command. Emperors Yao
and Shun had perhaps a bit more, but they didn’t have more than a
thousand. Xuan Yuan, however, had roughly 1500 of them under his
command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Five Emperors ‘merely’ had the power of elite True
Gods/Daofathers. If one truly wished to become as powerful as
possible, one would generally choose to become a follower of the
Three Sovereigns instead! Suiren’s Kindlefire world, for example,
had more than ten thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals within
it. There were many secret whispers that Suiren was actually the most
powerful individual in the Three Realms, and so he naturally had many
followers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial Imperial
Clan was the master of the entire human race. Many Daofathers were at
its command, to say nothing of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Xuan Yuan, who had
long ago given up his title as leader of the human race, to still
command more than 1500 Empyrean Gods and True Immortals was actually
quite incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti gazed
downwards. He said calmly, “Since we are going to fight, then let
us have a good one. This Realmwar is going to be different from the
previous ones. In all the previous Realmwars combined, we lost around
a thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. But this time…Xuan
Yuan has more than 1500 under his command. Factoring in all the
reinforcements he will receive, he will have more than 2000 under his
command. ‘Ordinary’ casualties would be in the hundreds, but if
the fighting becomes especially fierce, it’s entirely possible that
more than a thousand will be killed. In other words…this Realmwar
will see as many casualties as all the other Realmwars thus far
combined!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone below him
could feel the silent pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their side would have
more than two thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals? The enemies
would most likely have a similar number of experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A battle like this…even
most Daofathers would run the risk of being surrounded and
annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which of you would
like to join?” Subhuti looked at Ning and the others. “If you
wish to join, you will of course be allowed to command a formation
comprised of other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each and every one of
Subhuti’s disciples was extraordinary. Even the latecomers like Ji
Ning and Redsnow were quite impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me.” A voice rang
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The speaker was
Empyrean God Silvermoon. Silvermoon no longer looked as relaxed and
carefree as he had in the past. His body was covered with a baleful
aura that had come from centuries of battle and slaughter. Long ago,
Silvermoon had expressed a willingness to accompany Ning in battle,
but for the sake of rescuing his wife, Ning had temporarily put aside
his plans to enter the war. Silvermoon was unwilling to wait, and so
he had gone out by himself to take part in quite a few wars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. This comes from
actual Chinese quasi-mythological history. The Flame Emperor ‘Yandi’
(who many believe to be Shennong or a descendant of Shennong) was
defeated by the Yellow Emperor ‘Huangdi’, who merged their two
tribes together into the ‘Yanhuang’ (flame-yellow) tribe that is
viewed as the tribe that eventually became the Chinese people.  ↩

Chapter 5 - Daomother Devilhand
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the disciples under
Subhuti’s tutelage, Silvermoon’s battles against the Seamless
Gate were the most savage of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Ji Ning
didn’t understand why. Later, he learned that Silvermoon had once
had a Dao-companion. However, during the war that destroyed the
Primordial Era, his Dao-companion had died…and it was as though
Silvermoon had lost his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later on, the Lord of
All Fiends had brought back the survivors of the Seamless Gate to the
Three Realms, and the Nuwa Alliance had been unable to do anything to
him. Thus, the two sides had made peace, resulting in the Seamless
Gate being allowed back into the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Silvermoon had
attacked. He started a wild massacre of the Seamless Gate’s forces.
He was even willing to kill Celestial Immortals! As for Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals? Nearly twenty of them died by Silvermoon’s
hands! He had fought in such a berserk fashion that he had
accidentally killed many weak cultivators as well. He had fought like
a man possessed, causing the True Gods and the Daofathers of the
Seamless Gate to be both shocked and enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, the Seamless
Gate wanted to live a peaceful life in the Three Realms. Because
Silvermoon was the disciple of Subhuti, they didn’t kill him;
instead, they negotiated this matter with the major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance. In the end, Silvermoon’s master had forcibly ordered
him back to Mount Innerheart, where he was given the low-key position
of overseeing the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had slaughtered and
murdered so many that he, too, suffered the effects of karmic
sinflames. Back at Mount Innerheart, he talked and laughed as though
nothing had ever happened, and his life within the Divinities Palace
was a relaxed, leisurely one. No one knew, however, that the hatred
and fury in his heart had never subsided. When the storm had
descended, he had been willing to follow Ji Ning and kill alongside
him, as he could see that Ji Ning was as berserk as he was. However,
who would’ve thought that Ji Ning would suddenly stop fighting? He
had thus ventured out on his own to fight alone. He didn’t blame Ji
Ning at all. He knew very well that if it was his Dao-companion, he
probably would’ve made the same choice as Ji Ning had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Subhuti
nodded. “Who else?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been a long
time since I’ve fought in a war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many disciples
actually all began to call out. Of the many disciples present, the
only two not to speak out were actually Ji Ning and Redsnow. Ning
hesitated a moment, then said, “Master, let me go. This Realmwar is
different from the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for you to go.” Subhuti shook his head. “A Realmwar on this
level…your participation won’t have much of an effect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master’s words
were correct. A grand formation created by just 200-300 Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals would be comparable to a true Daofather in power!
His own Rahu God was actually probably a bit weaker than those
formations. In this war, each side was mobilizing 2000-3000 Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals, who would be using some truly powerful
formations. Even ordinary Daofathers would die if they intervened.
Whether Ning participated or not really wouldn’t make much of a
difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a war like this,
massed power was what really made the difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow? How about
you?” Subhuti looked towards Redsnow. Redsnow had been the follower
of Daoist Threelives, and was legendary for his warmaking abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t go.”
Redsnow shook his head. “Your disciple has gained some insights
lately and is at a critical moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Subhuti’s
eyes lit up. He didn’t believe Redsnow was lying about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t
surprised. Ever since he had given a bottle of chaos nectar to
Redsnow, allowing Redsnow to train to the second stage of the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods], Redsnow had entered secluded meditation for some
reason! The only reason Ning had reached out to him was due to
Subhuti’s summons; otherwise, he wouldn’t have bothered Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, focus on your training. It would be wonderful if you can break
through to become a Daofather before the Endwar,” Subhuti said with
a smile. He knew that Ning had given a bottle of chaos nectar to
Redsnow, as Ning had actually discussed this with him before doing
so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Subhuti, a single
bottle of chaos nectar wasn’t enough. Any True God or Daofather
would need at least a hundred such bottles in order to train to the
second level of the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]. A single bottle? It
would only be of use when given to Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later, Subhuti
led his disciples to the Deerchaser major world of the Yellow Emperor
Realm. The Deerchaser major world was the world where the Yellow
Emperor, Xuan Yuan, lived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the imperial
palace of the Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti and Xuan Yuan
were both seated, with Ji Ning and the rest of the disciples all
standing to one side. Ning carefully inspected this legendary figure,
this Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan who had once defeated even Shennong in
their battle for dominance over the world. In terms of appearance,
Xuan Yuan was an immaculately handsome man. His gaze seemed to bring
an aura of the spring wind with it, causing others to unconsciously
feel well-disposed towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that when they fought long ago, Xuan Yuan was merely a elite
Daofather. Although it was true that Shennong’s mind wasn’t
really focused on leading his armies, he was still someone on the
same level of power as the leaders of the Daoism and Buddhism. For
Xuan Yuan to be able to achieve victory was testament to his military
prowess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Three
Realms, Xuan Yuan was most likely the number one military mastermind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from Ji Ning,
all of these disciples will take part in the battle,” Subhuti said
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Xuan Yuan
was overjoyed. He immediately said, “That’s wonderful! I was
worrying about this just before you came. The more powerful a
formation, the more requirements are placed upon the centers of the
formation. Before Mother Nuwa departed, she left us with three mighty
formations meant to protect our entire race. Logically speaking, we
should have Daofathers assume central command, but since neither side
has deployed Daofathers yet, we are forced to use Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals…and the more powerful, the better! I was worrying
about not having enough powerful Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
Subhuti, you came just in the nick of time. This is like delivering
warm coals to a freezing man in the midst of winter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This war will be
different from the previous ones. The previous Realmwars were all
small-scale battles; this one is going to be far greater,” Subhuti
said seriously. “After this Realmwar ends, the other large-scale
Realmwars shall begin as well. The Realmwar for your Yellow Emperor
Realm will be the very first of the large-scale battles; we have to
make sure that the outcome is a beautiful one. Let’s deal the
Seamless Gate a heavy blow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Xuan Yuan
nodded. “If we can seize the advantage, we’ll be able to keep the
advantage. This war will indeed be very important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went, a
thousand-kilometer canal could be collapsed by a single errant
anthole!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle would be a
critical one. If they were to lose, the upcoming battles would become
more difficult as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Subhuti’s
forces, the other major powers of the Three Realms sent
reinforcements of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals as well. In fact,
quite a few came by themselves! Within the span of a single short
month, the number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who had
gathered here within the Deerchaser world numbered more than 2800.
All of them were focused on learning the foundational parts of these
mighty formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine Empyrean Gods/True
Immortals including Goldcrow and Empyrean Phoenix, who were ranked
amongst the most powerful of experts and were also indisputably
loyal, were permitted to learn the core techniques to these ancient,
powerful formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddely, one day, the
entire Deerchaser world trembled. Ning hurriedly emerged from his
residence, raising his head to stare towards the outside, his eyes
blazing with torch-light. He was able to clearly see the sky split
apart tens of millions of kilometers away, as a castle that was
radiating limitless amounts of bloody light came flying out from
within that giant crack in the skies. The aura that emanated from the
castle quickly swept through the entire Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The castle was ten
thousand kilometers long. It slowly descended, then came to a halt in
midair. Above the castle was a glowing streak of bloody light that
rose high into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daomother
Devilhand.” Subhuti, Xuan Yuan, and Suiren stood shoulder to
shoulder, staring towards the distance. Subhuti frowned as he made
this statement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devilhand actually
came? And she came in person, in her true form.” Suiren frowned as
well. He had merely sent one of his clones here, while Subhuti and
Xuan Yuan were both here in person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was the most mysterious figure within the Seamless Gate, and he had
incredible escaping techniques. Not even Mother Nuwa had been able to
do anything to him when he had chosen to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of the
Everwood was someone that the Nuwa Alliance did not wish to make an
enemy out of. He was skilled in countless techniques and spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand was
the most berserk member of the Seamless Gate, and her power was
absolutely astonishing. She was so berserk that during the war that
ended the Primordial Era, she had actually dared to duel Mother Nuwa
one-on-one for a long period of time. In fact, she had even dared to
go battle the two leaders of Buddhism and Daoism all by herself! In
the end, she had been heavily wounded by Daoist Three Purities’
‘Immortal Slaying Sword Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was an absolute
madwoman. When gripped by bloodlust, she wouldn’t even care about
her own life. However, no one dared to deny that she was powerful.
Even during the war that ended the Primordial Era, the only ones who
could be described as unquestionably more powerful than her were
Mother Nuwa and the Lord of the Demonheart. No others!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the
Seamless Gate really wishes to win this battle,” Subhuti said.
“They actually sent Daomother Devilhand to guard their forces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We want to win, but
so do they,” Xuan Yuan said. “In the end…victory will be
determined on the field of battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have all our
preparations been made?” Suiren asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Xuan Yuan
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the
Deerchaser world was jittery right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two mighty castles, one
surrounded by bloody light, the other surrounded by golden light.
Both hung there in midair, facing each other from several hundred
thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both armies were
gathering within their respective castles, prepared to launch the war
at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This war…it’ll
be the largest war that we will fight before the final battle for
karmic luck.” Silvermoon stood alongside Ning atop the city walls,
staring at the distant Seamless City as it glowed with bloody light.
“The total number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on our side
for this war number nearly three thousand. The Realmwars that come
after this one in the Realms of the various elite Daofathers will
generally involve just a few hundred, maybe a thousand at most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. As for Celestial Immortals and
Loose Immortals, it feels as though there is an infinite number of
them,” Ning said with a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, he felt a
bit of regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Regret that he wouldn’t
be able to take part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keep waiting. Bide your
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he took part in
this battle…given how vast it was, he really wouldn’t make much
of a difference. He really wondered…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How much longer were
those two clones of his going to remain within Undermoon Lake?

Chapter 6 - The War Begins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two castles hung in
the air, facing each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the army of the
Seamless Alliance, it had been dispatched already. They covered the
wilderness, calling out the Nuwa Alliance for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first time they
called out for battle, the Nuwa Alliance completely ignored them, not
responding at all. The second time the Seamless Gate did this…the
Nuwa Alliance still ignored them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that when calling out the enemy for battle, the insults would be
absolutely atrocious to hear. The worse the insult, the better! This
was true amongst mortals, and it was similarly true amongst these
Immortals and Fiendgods, who were quite boorish and foul-mouthed in
their catcalls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third time. Still
nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, the Seamless
Gate is calling us out again,” a white-robed youth said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan sat in front
of a desk, leisurely flipping through a book in his hands. Hearing
his disciple’s report, he laughed softly. “Daomother Devilhand
lives up to her reputation. Had the Seamless Gate sent over any other
Daofather, that person probably wouldn’t be so quick to bare the
fangs in such a manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Know thy enemy and know
thyself; only then would you be the victor in all your battles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the long years
of peace that had previously existed between the Seamless Gate and
the Nuwa Alliance, the Nuwa Alliance had learned much of the history
of Daomother Devilhand when she lived within the Seamless Chaosworld.
Although she was a madwoman, she was extremely adept at leading
soldiers in battle. All of her disciples were females, and all of
them were just as crazy as she was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She led her madwomen in
a conquest across the chaosworld, sweeping through it like a storm.
In the end, it had been the Lord of the Demonheart himself who had to
be the one to stop her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of frontal
attacks, not even Lord Demonheart was a match for Daomother
Devilhand. But of course, in terms of manipulating the mind and
understanding the demons that lay in every heart, who could possibly
match up to Lord Demonheart? Conquering the world wasn’t merely a
matter of warfare! And so, in the end it had been Lord Demonheart who
had unified the Seamless Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Xuan Yuan put
down his scroll, then said with a smile, “Give the order. Assemble
for battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh huh…” For a
second, the yellow-robed youth was as calm as ever…but suddenly, he
stared wide-eyed towards Xuan Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you still
here?” Xuan Yuan turned to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“R-right. Your
disciple shall go immediately.” The yellow-robed youth hurriedly
flew out, beginning to summon the various parties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan walked
outside of the room. Standing by the rails, he stared at his vast
citadel. As the order was given, a sea of soldiers came flooding out
from throughout the citadel, quickly assembling together. Xuan Yuan
nodded lightly. “This is the fourth time they are calling for
battle. It’s about time. This war is critical; if we win it, we’ll
be halfway to winning the war for karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to win.”
An awe-inspiring light flashed through Xuan Yuan’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the city walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti, Xuan Yuan, and
Suiren were standing shoulder-to-shoulder, staring at the two armies
facing off against each other on the desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the yellow-robed
youth, and a number of other disciples were following behind them.
None of them dared to so much as breathe too loudly. They all knew
exactly how important this war was going to be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of the two distant
armies had begun to assemble into mighty formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
the Seamless Infinity Formation, the ‘Life and Death Formation of
the Twin Realms Calamity Dragons’ 1, and the Infinity Fiendgod
Formation. These were their three primary formations, and each of
these terrifying formations needed two to three hundred Empyrean
Gods/True Immortals in order to be formed. There were also some
golems which Ning couldn’t even name, each of which was on an even
higher level of power than the Daofather golem Ning had previously
encountered. The golems glistened with violet light, emanating a
heart-shaking aura of terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
three formations of Calamity Dragons. Above these three formations
swam a countless number of black dragons, each of which was as
powerful as an ordinary Empyrean God. The important thing was…there
was an absolutely incredible number of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
two Seamless Infinity Formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also two
Infinity Fiendgod Formations. They had come together to form a pair
of towering, white-haired, red-eyed Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance also
had three primary formations. They were the Sidereal Star Formation,
the Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation, and the Pangu Genesis
Formation. There were three of Sidereal Star Formations, five of the
Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation, but only one Pangu Genesis
Formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from them, there
were also more than a hundred Seven Planets Gods who were scattered
everywhere, moving with great agility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for golems? The Nuwa
Alliance didn’t have a single golem on their side. Clearly, a
battle at this level meant that only golems of a certain power level
could be used. The Nuwa Alliance obviously didn’t have any golems
of such power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
formations, the Seamless Gate is far inferior to us,” Subhuti said
calmly from his position atop the walls. “The Seamless Infinity
Formation was created by Lord Demonheart. As for the Life and Death
Formation of the Twin Realms Calamity Dragons, the Seamless Gate
stole it from us. Back then, we didn’t expect that a day like this
would come, and so we were willing to teach them formations of this
level. As for the Infinity Fiendgod Formation…it should’ve been
devised by Everwood. It’s actually the most powerful of the
three…but alas, it’s still vastly inferior to our Pangu Genesis
Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Mother Nuwa
broke through to the Pangu level, she spent a tremendous amount of
research and effort in order to devise the Pangu Genesis Formation.
Before she left the Three Realms, she imparted it to us as a
formation for protecting our entire race,” Xuan Yuan said with a
laugh. “How could their formations possibly match up to it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, Mother
Nuwa had misgivings early on. She warned us sternly long ago that
these three guardian formations were absolutely not to be taught to
others. This is why we now have the power to keep them suppressed in
formation power.” Subhuti let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren nodded slowly.
“Fortunately, we have those three protective formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
secretly nodded upon hearing this. They had heard the stories as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it could be said
that the Nuwa Alliance was deeply envious of the Seamless Gate’s
mastery over the art of golems, then the Seamless Gate was similarly
envious of the three mighty guardian formations of the Nuwa Alliance.
All three of these formations had been left behind by Mother Nuwa
after she had broken through to become a World God. She had spent
tremendous blood, sweat, and effort on these formations, precisely
because she was afraid that once she left, other powerful alien
Outsiders like the Lord of All Things would appear. She was afraid
that the Three Realms would not be strong enough to withstand another
such Outsider, and so she created and imparted these three
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three formations
would generally have a True God or Daofather at the center, with many
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals acting as support. Their power was
utterly shocking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, a
simplified version could be used which allowed for an Empyrean
God/True Immortal to server as the center. The power of the formation
would drop dramatically, of course, but despite that it still wasn’t
something the Seamless Gate could compete against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Pangu Genesis
Formation.” Ning stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Genesis
Formation had, at its center, the disciple of Daofather Fuju - True
Immortal Jimin, the ‘Sword Immortal of the Outer Heavens’. 580
Empyrean Gods were supporting him, joining together into this utterly
astonishing formation! This formation was so powerful that it was as
strong as a elite Daofather! Most importantly of all, True Immortal
Jimin was the person controlling this formation. True Immortal Jimin
was the only Empyrean God or True Immortal in the Three Realms who
had mastered the [Five Treasures]. His sword-art surpassed the limits
of the Heavenly Daos, allowing him to unleash truly astonishing
levels of power from this Pangu Genesis Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still remember my
arrival into the Netherworld Kingdom after I died in my previous
life. Back then, I encountered this Life and Death Formation of the
Twin Realms Calamity Dragons.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. The
terrifying, world-shattering formation that had destroyed even the
Sixth Paths of Reincarnation had once more appeared before him. Back
then, in the Netherworld Kingdom, Ning had been nothing more than a
puny human ghost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the slightest
aftershock ripple from an attack by a Calamity Dragon would have
completely destroyed his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s begun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on the walls
were nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti, Suiren, and
Xuan Yuan stared intently at the battle below, especially Xuan Yuan.
Xuan Yuan’s coresense filled every part of the battlefield, and he
was constantly rearranging the military deployments, arranging for
the various Seven Planets Gods to better harmonize with the major
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
nine mighty formations, each of which had nine central figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of Subhuti’s
disciples were in command of three mighty formations; they were
Empyrean Phoenix, Goldcrow, and Junwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Senior
apprentice-brother Goldcrow was in command of a Sidereal Star
Formation. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Senior
apprentice-sister Empyrean Phoenix and senior apprentice-brother
Junwu were each in charge of a Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the towering,
massive Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation were composed of a
hundred True Immortals, a hundred thousand Celestial Immortals, and
more than a hundred million Loose Immortals. Together, they were
capable of summoning an utterly enormous amount of natural energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous figure of a
giant appeared in the air above the formation. It was senior
apprentice-brother Junwu, his white robes fluttering gracefully. He
raised up his painting brush, casually swiping towards the heavens
with it. Instantly, countless weapons appeared in the skies that shot
towards the distant forces of the Seamless Gate. With another stroke
of the brush, he manifested countless divine soldiers and divine
generals and sent them to attack as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Junwu.” Ning felt eager when watching this.
Junwu was the young child who loved to paint which Subhuti had
accepted as his disciple long ago. Upon meeting, Subhuti had given
him a single line of guidance…and overnight the child had
completely mastered a Dao-Path, the Dao of Inkwater. It could be said
that he was the most talented disciple Subhuti had ever accepted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battling against Junwu
was an extremely headache-inducing decision, because his techniques
were simply too complex. His flicks of the brush were capable of
virtually drawing anything in the world…but precisely due to the
complexity of his Dao, Junwu had yet to break through to become a
Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. This was the
formation that appeared during the destruction of the Six Paths of
Reincarnation, all the way back in Book 1, Chapter 2!  ↩

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heavens trembled.
The ground shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Pangu God, clad in a

Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance’s
‘Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation’ was exchanging
long-distance attacks with the Seamless Gate’s ‘Life and Death
Formation of the Twin Realms Calamity Dragons’, disrupting the
entire battlefield with their attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long-distance attacks,
protective stances, rapid response reinforcements…the Seven Planets
Gods and the golems were quite nimble, and they served to cause chaos
throughout the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The desolate wilderness
was utterly annihilated, so much so that the empty Void could be
occasionally seen in multiple places as space was torn apart, then
reformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals are massed in numbers, they truly do become quite
terrifying.” Ning was nervous as he watched the war. “If either
side reveals a single weakness, it’s entirely possible that there
will be a large-scale collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The marshals on both
sides are quite powerful as well. Under Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s
guidance, the major formations and the hundred-plus Seven Planets
Gods seem to work together like a perfect whole, leaving behind no
flaws or openings to exploit. Daomother Devilhand’s attacks,
however, are absolutely fiendish. In fact, she nearly destroyed a
Seven Planets God just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. Despite having
battled for quite some time, the Nuwa Alliance had yet to lose even a
single Seven Planets God! This was testament to how flawless and how
formidable Xuan Yuan was in commanding his troops.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.” Xuan
Yuan gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Xuan Yuan’s
guidance, the great army of the Nuwa Alliance began to retreat in an
orderly fashion, not giving their enemies even a single chance to
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the first
exchange of blows had come to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a madwoman like
Daomother Devilhand was extremely calm and collected when commanding
a battle of this level. This was because even the slightest of
mistakes could result in the entire war being lost. In truth, wars
like this weren’t won, they were lost when one side made too many
errors! Although Daomother Devilhand was legendary for her ferocious
attacks, she actually made very few mistakes when commanding troops.
It was simply that she believed in the adage that ‘the best defense
is a good offense’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her assaults had caused
the Seamless Gate to put Xuan Yuan under tremendous pressure.
However…Xuan Yuan was clearly even more talented and skilled than
her, and his force deployments were even better. He moved his troops
about like the floating clouds and the flowing water, showing no
flaws at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
three engagements had occurred and more than a month had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunt-master, if this
continues, it won’t be good for us. With each clash, we have lost
more than our foes. It won’t be apparent in the short run, but if
this sort of battle persist for two or three years, our weakness will
become apparent.” The black-robed Godking stood off to one side,
looking at the slender, violet-robed woman seated before him. In his
heart, he felt rather nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed
woman’s eyes seemed to be like two endless seas of blood. In terms
of slaughter, she was the undisputed number one of the Seamless Gate,
a demon amongst demons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The
violet-robed woman looked at the black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just
concerned,” the Godking said hastily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are right.”
The violet-robed woman lightly tapped on her armrest, a white
crystalline bracelet around her arm. “I fought countless battles in
the war for the Seamless Chaosworld, but I never met someone as
formidable as him in leading armies. Battles on this level happen at
incredible speed, and multiple variables are introduced every
moment…and yet, he’s actually able to factor them all in while
deploying his forces in an utterly perfect manner. No wonder this
Xuan Yuan fellow was able to defeat Shennong during the Primordial
Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” The Godking said hurriedly. In the Seamless Gate, the only
ones capable of making the Godking act in such an obedient manner
were the Lord of All Fiends, the Keeper of the Everwood, and
Daomother Devilhand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to win this
war.” The violet-robed woman continued, “If we lose this war, the
wars that come later will be much, much harder to win. We’ll need
to spend even more effort, but we still might not be able to achieve
victory in the final war for karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking mumbled
mentally to himself. No shit. Everyone knows this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arrange for an Envoy
of All Things to come,” the violet-robed woman ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Envoy of All
Things?” The black-robed Godking was shocked. He couldn’t help
but ask, “We’re going to have an Envoy of All Things come? Now?
B-but…we were preparing to use them in the final battle for karmic
luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make the
arrangements. Otherwise, we won’t be able to win,” the
violet-robed woman said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.
However…we’ll need the Lord of All Fiends to concur in this
matter,” the black-robed Godking said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and go.”
The violet-robed woman frowned, a dangerous glint of anger appearing
in her eyes. The black-robed Godking was instantly so terrified that
his heart quailed. He had grown up in the Seamless Chaosworld, after
all. Even though he was now a Daofather, he still felt dread when
facing Daomother Devilhand. She was a madwoman! Others would perhaps
give him face as the nominal leader of the Seamless Gate and as the
disciple of Lord Demonheart, but this madwoman would even dare to
assault Lord Demonheart himself, to say nothing of the ‘Godking’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the top of a
solitary mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A red-robed,
azure-haired man was seated here, staring into the boundless Void.
His gaze had long ago pierced through the dimensional barriers
separating worlds, allowing him to see through the space beyond them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
suddenly materialized next to him. It was the black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord,” the
Godking said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
Lord of All Fiends glanced at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunt-master believes
that our chances of victory are low. If things continue, we may very
well lose. She instructed me to come here to request an Envoy of All
Things,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
frowned. “If that’s the case…go speak to Blackheaven. Take an
Envoy back and give it to Devilhand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Godking
respectfully departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
once more stared into the Void. He murmured softly, “I truly wish I
could go back to the old days, when I could hide myself behind
Demonheart and Everwood…but alas, I’ve been forced to stand
forward. They even address me as the ‘Lord of All Fiends’, as
Fiendlord. It was far better when I was simply ‘Windfiend’; life
as Windfiend was far more relaxed and carefree than life as the
‘Fiendlord’. I really wonder what this war will end up like.
Although Mother Nuwa has already departed, she left these three
mighty formations behind. It’s hard to say exactly how powerful
those three protective formations are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If worse comes to
worst, I’ll try to save as many as I can, then leave the Three
Realms.” The Lord of All Fiends shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no taste for
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the era of the
Seamless Chaosworld, he had been a very low-key figure. Back then,
the most dazzling figures had been the Lord of the Demonheart, the
Keeper of the Everwood, and Daomother Devilhand. No one had paid much
attention to Windfiend, even though he was also born an Elder Fiend
like the rest of them. In fact, there were many major powers in the
Seamless Chaosworld who believed that Windfiend’s power came solely
due to his good fortune in being born as an Elder Fiend, as it didn’t
seem as though he had improved much at all since being born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They only showed him
respect because he was an Elder Fiend as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windfiend didn’t
really care. He enjoyed being carefree and unbound…but the war that
ended the Primordial Era had simply been too devastating. So many of
his old friends, his brothers, had ended up dying in battle. The Lord
of All Things had been very vicious; he had wanted to wipe out
everyone in both chaosworlds! As for Mother Nuwa, she was an even
more terrifying figure; she had actually broken through to a brand
new level, dominating all comers and slaying even the horrifying Lord
of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windfiend’s only
choice was to reveal his full power…and faced with death, he had
actually made a breakthrough of his own, making it so that not even
Mother Nuwa was able to catch him as he fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending a long
period of time wandering the primordial chaos in solitude, he had
returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth, all I
wanted was a safe place to call home.” The Lord of All Fiends shook
his head. The survivors of the Seamless Gate had insisted on
venerating him as the ‘Fiendlord’, making him the true,
undisputed leader of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly is the
cause of this tribulation? That old fellow, Demonheart, is plotting
something…but it feels as though there’s more to it than that…”
The Lord of All Fiends frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had made
his breakthrough while fleeing from Mother Nuwa, his ability to sense
the tides of fate had most likely become number one in all the Three
Realms. He could vaguely sense how terrifying this tribulation truly
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven stood in front of him, pointing towards a titanic,
ape-shaped golem that was completely dark-red in color and wreathed
in tongues of flame. “Take it away, I suppose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
swept the surrounding area with his gaze. Upon seeing all the other
Envoys of All Things in the area, he couldn’t help but feel his
heart itch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember, let the
most powerful Empyrean God you have command it,” Blackheaven
instructed. “Logically speaking, it should be reserved for a
Daofather to command, but despite that, this Envoy of All Things
should be able to unleash power comparable to that of a elite
Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
black-robed Godking nodded hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All those years ago,
the Lord of All Things had led an army of such Envoys, each of which
had reached a level of power that was fully capable of launching
attacks against the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism. They were utterly
terrifying on the field of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even with Empyrean Gods
in command of them, they were comparable to elite Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, make sure
Devilhand knows that no matter what, we can’t let the Nuwa Alliance
capture this Envoy of All Things.” Blackheaven laughed coldly, “My
worry is that the Nuwa Alliance will act in an utterly shameless way,
having experts like the Three Sovereigns or the leaders of Buddhism
and Daoism to suddenly attack and capture the Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Don’t worry.
Masters Devilhand and Everwood, as well as the Fiendlord, are paying
close attention to this battle. The True Gods and Daofathers of the
Nuwa Alliance won’t be given any chance at all,” the black-robed
Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Is Ji Ning
taking part in the battle?” Blackheaven suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The Godking
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity.”
Blackheaven felt resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly, truly wanted
to kill Ning. Although almost all of his efforts were centered on
these golems, he still felt hatred for Ning. It was rare for him to
feel affection for someone…and that little girl had died, just like
that. Although Ning had merely killed her in his counter-attack when
they had attempted to assassinate him, Blackheaven really didn’t
give a damn about the particulars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. If Ji
Ning dares to enter the field of battle, I’ll make sure to ask
aunt-master Devilhand to give him some special attention,” the
black-robed Godking laughed. “I’ll take my leave, Grandmaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go.”
Blackheaven nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking waved his
hand, collecting the Envoy of All Things, then left the Allfiend
world, heading towards the Deerchaser world once more.

Chapter 8 - Descent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
stood atop the castle walls, the black-robed Godking next to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They stood
shoulder-to-shoulder, staring at the distant wilderness. The army of
the Seamless Gate was there, calling out for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you sure that
they haven’t found out that you brought an Envoy of All Things?”
Daomother Devilhand asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
aunt-master,” the black-robed Godking said hurriedly. “I
personally went to collect the Envoy of All Things. How could I
possibly allow the Nuwa Alliance to find out about it? In addition,
the Envoy only requires a single Empyrean God/True Immortal in
control. While I was in the Allfiend world, I also brought along
Empyrean God Bloodwave. This, too, was kept a secret. Empyrean God
Bloodwave is extremely skilled in close combat; he was our number one
choice for controlling an Envoy during the final war for karmic luck.
With him in control, the Envoy will be able to unleash more than
enough power and be capable of rivaling elite Daofathers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although their Pangu
Genesis Formation is quite powerful, it’s one of the three guardian
formations left behind by Nuwa! All three of them have tremendous
power, but in order to unleash it they need a True God or Daofather
to serve as the core of the formation. They have True Immortal Jimin,
who mastered the [Five Treasures], serving as their core, which means
that the size, scale, and power of the formation is much weaker now.
It is just barely a match for elite Daofathers; there is still a
significant gap in power between it and our Envoy of All Things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sudden
appearance of the Envoy of All Things will immediately disrupt the
balance of the battlefield. Don’t be fooled by how seamless Xuan
Yuan appears to be in moving around his forces; once a collapse
starts, it will be complete and total.” The black-robed Godking was
quite confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daomother
Devilhand nodded. “I hope this Envoy of All Things truly is as
formidable as you say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoys which the
Lord of All Things had created were indeed quite powerful; they had
proven their strength during the war that ended the Primordial Era.
But the Envoys created by the Seamless Gate were developed by
Grandmaster Blackheaven. Grandmaster Blackheaven was a peerless
talent in the Dao of Golems who the Lord of All Fiends had found in
some unknown place. He was actually also capable of creating these
Envoys, and the power of his Envoys seemed to be equivalent to those
which the Lord of All Things had made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are coming
out.” The black-robed Godking’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They finally came
out. Xuan Yuan…” A hint of a cold light flickered through
Daomother Devilhand’s eyes. “This time, I’m going to make you
crumble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both armies once more
charged towards the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance’s
army had a slight edge to begin with. With Xuan Yuan’s truly superb
military skills, the Nuwa Alliance’s advantage was even more
apparent. Although Daomother Devilhand was also skilled in commanding
her troops, occasional setbacks still occurred for her forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was just like all
their previous clashes. Each time, the Seamless Gate’s forces would
be whittled away slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Atop the
castle walls, Daomother Devilhand sent a mental order. “Release the
Envoy of All Things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the field of battle,
the Pangu God and the two Infinity Fiendgods battled with the most
ferocity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu God formed by
the Pangu Genesis Formation held an utterly enormous sword in its
hands, executing sword-arts that all exceeded the limits of the
Heavenly Daos. It naturally possessed nigh limitless power. As for
the two white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgods, they were quite
powerful as well. The Infinity Fiendgod Formation had been developed
by Keeper Everwood, after all, and he had poured endless amounts of
blood and sweat into it. Both Infinity Fiendgods were dressed in
incomparably precious Protocosmic spirit-armors, which they relied on
to defend against the Pangu God’s terrifying sword-arts. Both
Infinity Fiendgods supported each other at all times, and so although
they were at a disadvantage, they were still able to hold on against
their foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The
Jimin-Pangu was extremely calm. He was waiting…waiting for his foes
to make a mistake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how well
those two Infinity Fiendgods fought together, they were still
commanded by two different people, not one. In a frenetic,
high-powered battle, it was inevitable that they would eventually
commit mistakes. Once they made a mistake, he would seize the
opportunity to wipe out one of them. Once one was destroyed, the
other would not be of any concern at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?!”
The Jimin-Pangu was shocked to discover that behind the two Infinity
Fiendgods, an ape-shaped figure had suddenly appeared out of thin air
without any warning. This creature’s entire body was wreathed in
flames, and its aura was so powerful as to instantly stun the
Jimin-Pangu. In fact, the subconscious sense of danger emanating from
this creature was so strong that he couldn’t help but mentally
shiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jimin, be careful!
That’s an Envoy of All Things.” Xuan Yuan’s voice immediately
rang out. “Ignore those two Infinity Fiendgods; I’ll send people
to help you block them. Focus on defending against the Envoy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright!” The
Jimin-Pangu instantly understood. He had heard of these Envoys long
ago, but he had never seen one of them in person before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the Envoy
appeared, Xuan Yuan’s face instantly changed. However, he remained
cool and collected as he quickly began to redeploy his forces,
squeezing out every drop of power he could to relieve the pressure on
the Jimin-Pangu, so as to let him fight against the Envoy without
worrying about anything else. That way, the Jimin-Pangu would have at
least a sliver of a chance of defending against the Envoy of All
Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if the
white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgods were allowed to join forces
with the Envoy, then the Jimin-Pangu would definitely suffer a swift
defeat. And once he collapsed…the entire field of battle would
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five of you, go
block the Seamless Infinity Formation closest to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
retreat and stop that group of golems!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan was
processing many things in parallel, sending simultaneous orders to
all the major formations as well as the Seven Planets Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
suddenly transformed in a chaotic, disastrous way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the city walls.
Xuan Yuan was watching over the entire battlefield here, quickly
redeploying his forces. Next to him were Subhuti and Suiren, and
their faces had turned grave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
disciples standing behind them were even more frantic than the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
instantly saw the situation turn grim for their side. “In order to
allow the Jimin-Pangu to safely focus on dealing with the Envoy of
All Things, he’s sending the Sidereal Star Formations and Myriad
Immortals Armageddon Formations to keep the Infinity Fiendgods tied
down. Although this will make things a bit easier for the
Jimin-Pangu, that means everyone else will now be under much greater
pressure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their strongest asset
on the battlefield was the Jimin-Pangu. Before the appearance of the
Envoy, the strongest assets the enemy had were those two Infinity
Fiendgods! Defending against the two of them put enormous pressure on
the rest of the army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Jimin-Pangu
was exchanging blows with the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWUUUU!!!!” The
fiery, ape-like Envoy of All Things raised its head, bellowing with
utter madness as it lashed out with its long claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Jimin-Pangu landed
a piercing blow on the Envoy with a streak of sword-light, but the
only result was a clear, ringing sound. The blow didn’t manage to
penetrate through at all! The Envoy, however, became even more
savage, its sharp claws filling the skies with endless attacks, with
the lashing whip-strikes from its simian tail also possessing
astonishing power. The Jimin-Pangu was at a complete disadvantage in
this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are beginning
to retreat.” Ning, watching from far away, was immediately able to
notice that their entire army was moving backwards, receding slowly
as a whole, like the receding ties of the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an incredible
figure Xuan Yuan is.” Ning couldn’t help but feel admiration for
him. If an ordinary commander was in charge, once their side was
unable to withstand the enemy attacks, they would begin to crumble
and break apart; it would be extremely hard for the army to retreat
intact. But despite the adverse battlefield situation, Xuan Yuan was
able to silently, perfectly coordinate a wholesale withdrawal.
Although the Seamless Gate realized this, there was nothing they
could do; they were already fighting with all their strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning’s face
suddenly changed. He stared towards the distance, where a distant
Seven Planets God just crumbled. A chain reaction began to occur,
with the five Seven Planets Gods next to him being thrown into grave
danger as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the withdrawal
continued, more and more Seven Planets Gods began to suffer damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan was still
quite calm as he continued with his arrangements. Clearly, in the
eyes of Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan…the loss of twenty-seven Seven
Planets Gods wasn’t too heavy a price to pay. If any of their nine
major formations were destroyed, their losses would be devastated. As
he saw it, to suffer some casualties during a retreat was
unavoidable. All he could do was minimize their losses as much as he
could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the Seven
Planets Gods were especially dazzling. One of them, a Seven Planets
God who wielded a pair of scimitars, was particularly outstanding. It
was the Seven Planets God commanded by Ning’s senior
apprentice-brother, Empyrean God Silvermoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon had exploded
forth with truly astonishing combat power. The missions which Xuan
Yuan had given him were all quite complicated, but he still carried
them out to perfection. He was as effective as three Seven Planets
Gods, all by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The withdrawal
continued, and their side continued to suffer losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Finally, a Myriad
Immortals Armageddon Formation suffered a collapse from all the
attacks it had sustained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred True
Immortals, a hundred thousand Celestial Immortals, and more than a
hundred million Loose Immortals instantly began to be massacred.
Faced with the terrifying, horde-like army of the Seamless Gate, they
weren’t able to fight back at all. Even their formation had been
destroyed; how could they possibly withstand these attacks?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan’s face
slowly turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
suddenly discovered that Silvermoon’s dazzling, berserk Seven
Planets God was in a dangerous situation. His earlier performance had
been simply too showstopping; clearly, he had drawn the attention of
the Seamless Gate’s army, which viewed him as a tough-to-chew bone
that they had to get rid of as soon as possible. Thus, the True
Immortal controlling the nearby Life and Death Twin Realms Calamity
Dragons Formation suddenly pointed towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black dragons in
the sky began to streak downwards, flocking towards Silvermoon’s
Seven Planets God.

Chapter 9 - Confluence
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…come,
come! The two of you, go! Leave this golem to me!” Silvermoon’s
Seven Planets God roared like a frenzied devil, charging forward to
block a violet-light golem on his own. This was the first time the
Seamless Gate had deployed these golems in a battle, and they were
fairly rare. Each of them was a bit more powerful than a Daofather
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way a
single Seven Planets God could withstand it…but Silvermoon’s
Seven Planets God charged forward to fight it solo, as though he had
gone mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black dragons continued
to descend from the heavens, assaulting Silvermoon as he fought
against the Daofather golem. Even the golem was affected by
collateral damage from their attacks; this was simply unavoidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon’s Seven
Planets God finally collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The savage,
violet-light golem was about to massacre the Immortals within, but
right at this moment, a towering, handsome, white-robed man suddenly
appeared before him. It was Empyrean God Silvermoon! Silvermoon
transformed to become three hundred thousand meters tall, with each
palm thirty thousand meters long. He stretched out his massive hands,
simultaneously grabbing onto two of the closest violet-light golems
next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha….” The
handsome, white-robed man roared with laughter, but held onto those
two golems with a death-clutch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although both golems
did their best to fight back, and although they were still able to
move forward, their were clearly slowed down dramatically by
Silvermoon’s deathgrip on them. There was no way they could
possibly chase after other members of the Nuwa Alliance. There were
only so many of them to begin with, and now two of them had been
suddenly bogged down at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Send two more. Trap
him into a magic treasure and seal him away.” Daomother Devilhand,
atop the walls of the Seamless Citadel, frowned as she sent the
mental order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve mastered the
Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], precisely because I want
to keep fighting without pause on this field of battle!” The
white-robed Silvermoon allowed the enemies to freely assault him. The
Seven Planets God was merely a formation, but his body itself had
reached the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; it was nearly
indestructible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon.” Ning watched the seemingly berserk
Silvermoon fight on the battlefield. Due to how recklessly and madly
Silvermoon had fought each time on the battlefield, Subhuti had
decided to give Silvermoon many Great Firmament Immortal pills,
enough to ensure that he could master the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. Subhuti had warned Silvermoon, “Mastery of
this art will only give you a higher chance of survival. If you
insist on acting in a suicidal manner, no one and nothing will save
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the battlefield,
Silvermoon could see two more of the golems charging towards him. His
divine body suddenly split apart into thirty, each of which fled
towards one of three directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silvermoon, you’ve
done enough! Hurry up and flee back here!” Xuan Yuan immediately
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All by himself,
Silvermoon had tied down four of the enemy golems, allowing the
pressure to ease up considerably on the other Seven Planets Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the grand army of the Nuwa Alliance completed its withdrawal, leaving
behind only the army of the Seamless Gate, which continued to call
out mockingly towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that Empyrean
God Silvermoon.” A baleful aura was in Daomother Devilhand’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon’s sudden
actions had indeed impacted the situation across the entire
battlefield. If it hadn’t been for him, with a bit of luck the
Seamless Gate might’ve been able to cause the entire army of the
Nuwa Alliance to collapse. Even if there was no collapse, their
losses definitely would’ve been much heavier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His divine body is
quite powerful. He must’ve trained in the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art],” the black-robed Godking said. “He was
willing to risk it all in using his own body to tie down our forces.
This did indeed have an impact on our pursuit. But…aunt-master,
Silvermoon split up into multiple bodies and fled in many different
directions, and we killed many of them. His life essence has
definitely been badly damaged. It’s entirely possible that it will
be a thousand years before he can fully recover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps.”
Daomother Devilhand nodded, a cold smile on her lips. “It took
multiple clashes for Xuan Yuan to kill a small portion of my forces.
I managed to cause him painful losses in just one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this battle, he
must have lost nearly six hundred Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals…and that’s because they were lucky. Next time, they
won’t be so lucky.” The black-robed Godking was filled with
confident as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to remain
on your guard.” Daomother Devilhand instructed, “And ask for your
master to help out. We have to get a clear sense of what the Nuwa
Alliance is planning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Godking
smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the levitating
citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood here was quite
depressed. Those who were allowed to wander about freely within the
castle were all Empyrean Gods or True Immortals. As for the Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals, they were all required to remain
within their respective camps. That way, they would be able to
assemble more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon, you were too rash. You nearly died
just now!” Ning looked at Silvermoon, whose aura was noticeably
much weaker than before. Those destroyed clones had all contained
part of Silvermoon’s soul. He had lost more than half his soul this
time. Although his Dao-heart was powerful enough for him to remain
clear-minded and have his soul dissipate, he was still at the very
brink of it happening. After fleeing, he had to eat a spirit-pill
Subhuti had given him before he was able to stabilize his soul. Right
now, Silvermoon’s power was perhaps just barely on the level of an
ordinary Celestial Immortal’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I didn’t try
something crazy, even more Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would
have died,” Silvermoon said softly. “To be honest…perhaps a
death on the battlefield is the most suitable refuge for me. I was
able to allow more of my friends to survive than would’ve
otherwise. It was worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon. Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
A distant voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Silvermoon
both turned to look. It was their golden-haired, golden-robed senior
apprentice-brother Goldcrow who was walking towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Goldcrow.” The two of them called out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silvermoon, you
truly rendered major merits to our cause this time. Just now, Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan said that if it wasn’t for you, the situation
would’ve been even uglier for us,” Goldcrow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Goldcrow, after you took control of a Sidereal
Star Formation, you rescued the Jimin-Pangu and its hundreds of
Empyrean Gods on multiple occasions. You are the one who has truly
done great things,” Silvermoon said. This was the truth as well;
because the Jimin-Pangu had to hold off the Envoy of All Things, it
had to be the last to flee. Since Goldcrow had the ‘Golden
Sunstreak’ divine ability, he had indeed assisted the army in
escaping, ensuring that the Seamless Gate was unable to catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for us to
talk about who did more. We were defeated this time, and disastrously
so.” Goldcrow shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This was
disastrous.” Silvermoon nodded. “Many of my good friends died in
battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning’s
heart sunk as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly six hundred
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Realms of the rest of the Five Emperors, such as Emperor
Zhuanxu, each held just barely six hundred Empyrean Gods/True
Immortals in total. For so many to die in a single battle…for every
five that took part in the battle, one had died! How many friends,
brothers, disciples had perished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti’s disciples
were all quite powerful, and they had all been quite lucky; all of
them had actually survived. But most of them had just barely been
able to escape, and even Silvermoon, who had mastered the Ninth Cycle
of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], had very nearly perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, they had
survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire citadel was
filled with agony, resentment, and an unwillingness to accept this
result. Their casualties had been horrendous, primarily because they
had lost a Myriad Immortals Armageddon Formation as well as a
Sidereal Star Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had wandered the
Three Realms for six centuries. He had visited every single major
world, and he had made many friends such as True Immortal Luoshui.
And this time…of the nearly six hundred slain Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals…there were 129 friends who had drank, chatted, and
laughed by Ning’s side. Some had even sparred with him before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
filled with misery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had gone to visit
Subhuti by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Subhuti was
seated in the lotus position. He looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me join the
battle,” Ning pleaded. “My Rahu God is comparable to those
violet-light golems. If I send eighteen of my clones, that’ll
represent a force capable of matching eighteen violet-light golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti sighed and
shook his head. “I understand how you feel right now…but right
now, the main problem isn’t the golems. It is the Envoy of All
Things! No matter how many low-level forces we have, if we can’t
use them together in an effective manner, there’s no way we’ll be
able to overcome the higher-level forces. The Envoy of All Things is
simply too strong. Even the Pangu Genesis Formation was at an
absolute disadvantage when facing it. It would be able to survive a
short clash, but if they fought for a long period of time, the only
result would be destruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me.” Subhuti
looked at Ning. “Would Seven Planet Gods, even a hundred of them,
be able to deal with a single Envoy of All Things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals trying to mob a Daofather would be massacred,
unless they were capable of some sort of formation that allowed them
to join their power together!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Envoy of All
Things has the power of a elite Daofather,” Subhuti said. “Your
Rahu God is much weaker than it, and its body is merely composed of
divine power. It will crumble as soon as its defenses are breached.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have methods for
dealing with the other golems and formations. The real problem is
this Envoy of All Things. If we can’t find a way to deal with it,
there’s no way we can win this war.” An expression suddenly
flickered across Subhuti’s face. “Leave me for now. Other major
powers have arrived. I need to go meet with them as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
respectfully withdrew, departing from Subhuti’s residence. Upon
stepping out, he suddenly raised his head to stare off into the
distance. Far away, one major power after another was descending,
each of them surrounded by auras of incredible power. All of these
major powers descended directly into Xuan Yuan’s palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that an Envoy of
All Things has appeared, things have become problematic for us. Not
even the Pangu Genesis Formation can withstand it.” A graceful,
poised woman was next to Ning, also staring towards the skies with
her head raised. It was senior apprentice-sister Empyrean Phoenix.
“The Pangu Genesis Formation was left behind by Mother Nuwa. It is
extremely powerful, but it really needs a Daofather commanding it in
order to unleash its true power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who can stand
against an Envoy of All Things?” Empyrean Phoenix shook her head.
“The major powers have all come here to discuss this very question,
no doubt. For so many major powers to be forced to convene…this is
testament to how problematic this Envoy is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
weight of the invisible pressure brought by the Envoy as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So many of his friends
had died in battle…was it all for nothing? Were they going to lose?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning’s body
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flood of memories
began to surge into his mind from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a blazing, fiery
star within the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime twisted and a
white-robed youth emerged from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the exit is
actually located here. It’s quite well-hidden. After six hundred
years…finally, I’m out.” The white-robed youth’s body
suddenly trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flood of memories
surged towards him from the distant Deerchaser world of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A confluence of
memories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His two clones had been
completely separated from the rest after they had entered Undermoon
Lake, and so there was no way for their memories to join together.
Upon exiting Undermoon Lake…instantly, the memories of the two
clones once more connected together with the memories of all the
other clones, joining together into a confluence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Part of the memories
were formed from his six hundred years in Undermoon Lake and his time
spent studying World God Northrest’s many sword-arts, which allowed
Ning to understand and master the number one sword-art of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other part of his
memories were formed from his experiences of roaming the Three
Realms, watching many events happen and gradually learning to
understand the human heart. They also included his experiences and
battles in Prisonworld 17.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two different
memories began to collide against each other, merging into one whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different insights into
the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different insights into
the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to
collide, merge, and fuse together…
</P>

Chapter 10 - The Return
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the core of
the blazing star was incredibly hot, the flames on its surface were
at most capable of harming Void-level Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
stood there, not moving at all. Six hundred years worth of memories
were fusing together nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be said that
in Undermoon Lake, Ji Ning was completely and utterly infatuated with
and devoted to the sword. All of his efforts had been spent on it,
and his heart had barely changed at all. But in the outside world,
Ning’s heart had changed on a fundamental level. He had spent six
hundred years dominating and soulscouring the prisoners of the
prisonworld and had seen so many memories. Memories of darkness, of
madness, of love, of betrayal…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every time he
soulscoured someone, the memories he saw would affect him slightly.
If an ordinary person was to see someone else’s memories, it was
entirely possible that the memories would all bleed into each other
and intermingle. Of course, this wouldn’t happen for someone on
Ning’s level, but generally speaking it wasn’t uncommon for
shadows to be cast over one’s mind. If one could endure it,
however, it would serve as a form of tempering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For someone like Ning,
the backlash caused by soulscouring really wasn’t worth mentioning.
However, his heart had still slowly evolved, becoming as bottomless
as an endless abyss, capable of holding anything within its depths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the time he
spent wandering the Three Realms and meditating on the Nine Chaos
Seals, it had continuously tempered and refined Ning’s heart even
further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One side had reached an
astonishing level in the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other had seen a
transformation of the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even mortals had the
saying, ‘put your heart into it’. Two experts might be at the
exact same level of sword-arts, but they would be able to produce
completely different results based on the level of their heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword was always
a bit too excessively sharp; it wasn’t quite stable and steady
enough. In Undermoon Lake, I was never quite able to make a
breakthrough in this regard,” the white-robed youth mumbled. He
suddenly pointed forward with his finger. At the tip of his finger
suddenly appeared a swirling whirlpool that was formed from
diametrically opposed types of power. Swish! The Void itself was
pierced through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…I’ve finally
made a bit of a breakthrough.” Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past six
hundred years in Undermoon Lake, Ning had almost completely focused
on the sword. This became even more the case after he had viewed the
ninety-eight stone steles which World God Northrest had left behind.
They revealed a brand new path for Ning. Ning had wanted to reach the
fifth level of swordforce very much, but going from the fourth level
to the fifth level was as hard as ascending to the heavens. It was
much like how only the great divinity Houyi had ever managed to reach
the fifth level of heartforce; the number of fifth-level swordforce
experts in the Three Realms could be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To break through and
reach the fifth stage of swordforce with just a few short centuries
of training was simply far too difficult. Ning had always worked very
hard, and although he hadn’t made a breakthrough in swordforce, he
had learned much and actually been able to embark upon a different
path. He had slowly gained insight into yinforce and yangforce, and
had even been able to join them together into infiniforce. Ning was
able to infuse many of his insights regarding World God Northrest’s
sword-arts into his infiniforce technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest’s
sword-arts actually contained many different types of force,
including swordforce, infiniforce, spacetime-force…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But clearly, when
training with the sword, Ning had gained more insights into Yin and
Yang, resulting in him comprehending the essence of infiniforce. In
truth, during his early years at Swallow Mountain, Ning had
simultaneously trained in two mighty sword techniques, one of fire,
the other of ice. When he trained in using ice and fire at the same
time, he was unconsciously training in the basics of Yin and Yang as
well. However, Ning had only spent so many years training, and most
of those years had been focused on the Dao of the Sword and the Grand
Dao of the Waterdrop. He was completely unwilling to divide his
attention towards other Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Undermoon Lake, Ning
didn’t train in any other Daos at all, only training in the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…in the end,
had gained insight into infiniforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After three years, he
had gained a basic level of insight into infiniforce. Srictly
speaking, in the outside world it could be said that he had already
gained insight into the Grand Dao of Infinity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After twenty years, his
infiniforce had reached the second level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After less than a
century, it had reached the third level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…he had yet to
be able to reach the fourth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, upon leaving
Undermoon Lake and reconnecting with the memories from the outside
world, his heart began to change. He drew upon the many insights
regarding the sword he had gained during six centuries of roaming the
Three Realms…and so, naturally and unconsciously, Ning reached the
fourth level of infiniforce as well. But most importantly of all,
because Ning’s insights were derived from World God Northrest’s
sword-arts, his infiniforce and his swordforce began to join together
into a perfect, flawless whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage of
swordforce…” Ning could sense it much more clearly now than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the
experiences of my predecessors were correct.” Ning nodded mentally
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
left behind many bamboo scrolls. Aside from containing techniques,
some contained knowledge and guidance for training in general, as
well as information regarding the endless primordial chaos. Alas,
World God Northrest had fled in a blind panic, and so even he wasn’t
certain how many different regions and dimensions of spacetime he had
traversed before reaching the Three Realms. Thus, the few maps he had
regarding the primordial chaos were all useless to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The knowledge and
guidance for training in general, however, was very useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to what World
God Northrest had said, if one wished to reach the fifth stage of
swordforce, one would ideally come up with ways of infusing other
types of force into one’s sword-arts, producing sword-arts of
greater power. The more powerful one’s sword-arts were, the closer
one would be to the fifth stage of swordforce. To reach the sixth
stage of swordforce would be to reach the stage known as the true
‘World of the Sword’. This was the stage of World Gods, a stage
that completely eclipsed the Heavenly Daos. The best way to reach
this level was to train in sword-arts that surpassed the Heavenly
Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
World God level, in and of itself, surpassed the Heavenly Daos. Thus,
training in sword-arts that surpassed the Heavenly Daos, even in just
one aspect such as the [Five Treasures] and speed, would still help
tear a small ‘crack’ in the barrier the Heavenly Daos presented.
This would allow Ning to move closer to that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Following the
guidance of my predecessors is akin to standing on their shoulders.”
Ning wouldn’t be so arrogant as to disregard their guidance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he needed to do
was constantly improve himself until he reached a point where he
surpassed even his predecessors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been forced
to personally consign Yu Wei into the Infinity Hells, Ning had
suddenly comprehended many things. He had murmured to himself:
‘Though I come from the mortal dust, my heart still soars towards
the heavens.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I just mastered
the Dao of Rainwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
stood there on the surface of the blazing star, stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of his mastery
over the [Five Treasures], he was finally able to comprehend other
Daos again. Within just a few breaths of time, he completely mastered
the Dao of Rainwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was primarily
because Ning was at simply far too high a level of understanding
right now. When his ninth apprentice-brother, Junwu, was still just a
mortal child, a single word of guidance from Subhuti had caused him
to suddenly master an entire Dao overnight. What level of
enlightenment had Ning reached? His sword-arts had surpassed the
Heavenly Daos, and his swordforce and infiniforce had joined together
perfectly. He had also absorbed the essence of the elite sword-arts
left behind by World God Northrest, and his self-created [Brightmoon]
sword-art was already definitely the number one sword-art of the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He possessed a
incredibly high level of insight, and also possessed an incredibly
high level of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comprehending the
various Daos he already had an affinity towards? It was just a matter
of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to pay the
prisonworld a visit.” The white-robed youth entered a boat-type
treasure, shuttling through the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the icy
star and entering the prisonworld…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I just mastered
the Dao of the Thunderclap?” As soon as Ning entered the
prisonworld, he was shocked by this revelation. He was surprised
because prior to training in the [Five Treasures], he had no talent
for lightning-affinity Daos at all. But now, he had suddenly mastered
it with tremendous speed. It was second only to the Dao of Rainwater;
he hadn’t even regained his other previous Daos, such as the Dao of
the Inferno. Instead, it was the Dao of the Thunderclap which had
come first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine body had
long ago become baptized by lightning, becoming a lightning-attribute
divine body. In terms of his body’s affinity for lightning, he was
actually on an even higher level than Exalted Celestial Thundergod,
who had been born out of the primordial chaos itself. His body was
able to completely become one with the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent,
just as perfectly as a Golden Crow would be able to become one with
the flames of the sun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, at this point
in time, Ning’s affinity for and talent in lightning actually
surpassed even his talent for water! However, he had focused on the
Grand Dao of the Waterdrop in the past. Even though his memories of
it were lost, he would instinctively gain insights into it much
faster than in other Daos, allowing him to quickly master the Dao of
Rainwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Inferno
and the Dao of the Gale all revealed themselves as well. He even
began to gain insights into the Dao of Space once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more solid a
foundation, the more one shall comprehend.” Ning was quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to what World
God Northrest had said, different chaosworlds all had different
Heavenly Daos! For example, the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld both had Heavenly Daos of Earth, but although they were
extremely similar, there were still a number of differences. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For true experts,
however, what really mattered was a solid foundation of fundamental
forces such as swordforce, infiniforce, taiji-force, or chaosforce.
Once one reached a sufficiently high level of insight into these
fundamental forces, then no matter what chaosworld one entered, one
would be able to rapidly gain insights into the many local Daos. By
now…Ning had gained a very stable foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, my
vision was far too limited. Or perhaps it would be more fair to say
that the True Gods and True Immortals of Pangaea had limited vision.”
Ning was quite moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of white-robed
youths stood there atop a grassy area within the prisonworld. There
were a total of eighteen of them, and they were scattered throughout
the region. In front of them was placed a large amount of Protocosmic
spirit-treasures and unique treasures. The most powerful aura came
from a sword…a Darknorth sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After six centuries of
sweeping through the prisonworld, more than twenty True Gods and True
Immortals had died by his hands! All the baleful aura released by
those deaths had allowed one of Ning’s six Darknorth swords to
finally break through and evolve to become a Chaos treasure, thanks
to the ‘Armaments of Sin’ technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, World
God Northrest left behind certain techniques to me, allowing me to
recognize how these treasures are meant to be used.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. In the original
Chinese, the character for ‘Earth’ used in Pangu and Seamless
were different.  ↩

Chapter 11 - Meeting the Godking
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While roaming the vast
primordial chaos, one had to be able to recognize treasures for what
they were. If you saw one without recognizing one and passed it by,
how laughable would that be? World God Northrest had naturally left
behind many records, allowing Ji Ning to identify the treasures he
was currently in most desperate need of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning willed
it, and a dirty-looking cauldron flew towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had acquired this
cauldron from an imprisoned Empyrean God. That Empyrean God had spent
quite some time analyzing the cauldron after acquiring it, but wasn’t
sure exactly how it was to be used. In fact, not even the seniors of
his sect that he asked knew the answer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Five Elements
Cauldron.” Ning nodded slowly. “I had thought that after leaving
Undermoon Lake, I would need to spend time and effort scrounging up
the materials I would need to forge one of these things. Now, I
realize that I actually already have one…and this one is at the
level of a Protocosmic spirit-treasure. Although it’s nothing in
the eyes of someone like World God Northrest, I probably wouldn’t
be able to make one as good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five Elements Cauldrons
were used to destroy magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. Destroy them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Precious items and
minerals, along with magic items, damaged or undamaged, could be
thrown into these cauldrons. They would be completely destroyed, and
then reformed into five types of Five Elements essences; Metal, Wood,
Water, Fire, Earth. Virtually every single treasure born from the
primordial chaos could be melted down into essences of the Five
Elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the primordial
chaos itself could be converted into the Five Elements!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The extracted essences
could be used to forge new magic treasures, as treasures that were
infused with them would undergo certain transformations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning was
in desperate need of such a cauldron was for the sake of that damaged
sword, the most important treasure World God Northrest had left him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel…although
its core essence is intact, the sword itself is so heavily damaged
that it is close to the brink of breaking apart. The sword is damaged
so heavily that there is no way it can be used in battle at all. I
have to use Five Elements essence in order to repair it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If given sufficient
Five Elements essence, Violetjewel’s physical structure could be
repaired enough to allow it to be once more used in battle. By then,
it would definitely be far more powerful than a mere Chaos weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given even more Five
Elements essence, Violetjewel could be completely repaired, allowing
it to regain all of its former power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To spend some Five
Elements essence in exchange for acquiring a weapon that surpassed
Chaos treasures? Of course Ning was willing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All those years ago,
World God Northrest’s efforts were completely focused on finding a
way to halt the decay of his truesoul. He was focused on trying to
stay alive, and so had no desire to waste time on creating a Five
Elements Cauldron, much less collecting the many treasures that would
be needed to refine a sufficient amount of Five Elements essences. As
far as World God Northrest was concerned, repairing the treasure
would be of no use to him. Staying alive was what really matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally
possessed the techniques needed to use a Five Elements Cauldron. He
was even capable of creating one anew, much less merely using one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Empyrean
God of Pangaea who had formerly owned the cauldron did not know these
techniques. In fact, his clan had never even heard of it. Generally
speaking, only the major powers of the primordial chaos would have
access to Five Elements Cauldrons, as only truly powerful figures
would be willing to throw so many precious treasures into a cauldron
and destroy them. The only reason why Ning himself had so many
treasures was because he had the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dirty-looking Five
Elements Cauldron had been silent for countless years. And now, it
finally had a chance to reveal its brilliance. Five streaks of light
shot out from its five handles, shooting towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning pointed
towards the cauldron, and ten top-grade Pure Yang treasures were
instantly flung into it. Ning had already completely swept through
all the Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals of the prisonworld, and
he had a simply enormous amount of top-grade Pure Yang treasures.
Every single Empyrean God and Celestial Immortal had quite a few;
Celestial Immortal Liangqiu, for example, had possessed more than
seven hundred flying swords. One of the prisoners had more than ten
thousand top-grade Pure Yang treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just threw in ten
to test it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hissssssss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like snow being thrown
into a furnace, a series of hissing, crackling sounds could be heard
as all ten Pure Yang treasures were completely annihilated, leaving
behind just a few tiny bits of debris. The essence of the Five
Elements flowed into the holding region for the Five Elements located
within the cauldron.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How savage.” Ning
pointed, and with a series of whooshes, a dense cluster of at least
ten thousand flying shuttles all flew into the Five Elements
Cauldron.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
Crack! All the Pure Yang treasures started to splinter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh oh.” Ning could
sense that his energy was depleting at a rapid pace. He hurriedly
pulled out a Pure Yang Immortal pill and tossed it into his mouth.
“World God Northrest actually neglected to notify me that using the
Five Elements Cauldron to destroy treasures and refine them into
essence is a process that uses up an enormous amount of energy.”
But what he had forgotten was that the clone he was using to control
the cauldron merely had a third-tier Pure Yang Jindan, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest was
a World God. The amount of energy used up by the cauldron was utterly
negligible for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left behind one
clone to refine the treasures into essence for repairing Violetjewel.
As for the other seventeen clones, he had all of them leave the
prisonworld. The ninety-eight stone steles and jade shrine which
World God Northrest had left behind had all been placed into the
prisonworld as well. Ning had brought them back, as the pocket
dimension Ning had been in collapsed as soon as he left it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core of that pocket
dimension was the sword Violetjewel. Once Ning took it away, the
pocket dimension would naturally crumble, leaving behind no traces of
its passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
appeared once more on the surface of that frozen star. His other
sixteen bodies were located within the estate-treasure he carried
alongside him, with fifteen of them focusing on training in the
[Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it, of his
eighteen clones of his main body, he would have seventeen upgrade
their Jindans. The reason he was going to leave one behind was
because he was going to leave it in the prisonworld and let it focus
on operating the cauldron. That one would remain un-upgraded, in case
that Ning’s other bodies were all destroyed in the war in the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they were
destroyed, the remaining body could use chaos nectar to quickly
rebuild the other seventeen! Ning would then be able to simply use
more Ninefire Lava and Iceheart Pith to re-upgrade their Jindans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he was to
upgrade his Jindan to the second-tier, allowing him to become a
half-step Daofather, then the cost of remaking seventeen clones would
become considerably higher, perhaps requiring ten times the amount of
chaos nectar. Ning had very little chaos nectar left; there was
simply no way he could afford that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“160,000 kilograms of
Ninefire Lava, 160,000 kilograms of Iceheart Pith. That’ll be
enough for fifteen clones of my true body and seventeen clones of my
Primaltwin.” Ning nodded. As for the remaining amount, he left it
all behind within the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was going to leave
behind a ‘seed’ of both his true body and his Primaltwin, just to
be safe. No one could predict what was going to happen within this
tribulation. Even though he was now much more powerful, Ning was
still going to be cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to meet the
Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew out from the
frozen star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the war for
the Deerchaser world was a pivotal moment in the war for karmic luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of his friends and
brothers had died in battle, causing Ning to wish to participate as
well. And indeed, he now had the power to make a difference. The
so-called ‘Envoy of All Things’? Ning was confident in being able
to deal with it! But before doing so, he had to first rescue Yu Wei.
Otherwise, once he revealed his full power on the Deerchaser world,
the Godking would most likely have second thoughts and once more use
Yu Wei to blackmail him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to first rescue
his wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then could he
return to the Deerchaser world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
appeared out of nowhere within the northern seas of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Seamless
Gate had been defeated in the war for the Grand Xia, they had still
launched repeated, minor incursions against the world. True Immortal
Dongyan had died in one such clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning spread
out his heartforce, quickly discovering one of the Seamless Gate’s
bases in the northern seas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth. I
wish to speak to the Godking of your Seamless Gate. Make the report
right away,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The base was only
staffed by a Celestial Immortal. Upon hearing Ning’s mental
message, he was badly frightened. He was of the Grand Xia; naturally,
he knew of the legendary power of Ji Ning, Empyrean God Darknorth.
Darknorth was someone who had roamed the Three Realms and slaughtered
many members of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortal
put everything else aside and immediately made a report to his
master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser major
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
and Daomother Devilhand were both standing atop the castle walls,
staring at the vast wilderness in front of them. The great army of
the Seamless Gate filled the wilderness, and they were calling for
the enemies to come engage them in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They remain behind
their fortifications, not daring to come out and fight.” The
black-robed Godking laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yesterday, quite a
few True Gods and Daofathers of the Nuwa Alliance descended upon the
castle. It seems they are discussing what to do about this war.”
Daomother Devilhand laughed coldly, “Hmph. What sort of ideas can
these major powers possibly come up with? The Envoys of All Things
were devised by the Lord of All Things. What, does the Nuwa Alliance
think that they can also create a golem of this level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could they? The
Lord of All Things was someone capable of bringing disaster to two
chaosworlds and nearly destroying them both.” The black-robed
Godking laughed. “Not even the protective formations which Mother
Nuwa left behind are able to withstand the Envoys. They are
definitely going to lose-…eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
looked towards the Godking, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
laughed. “It’s fine. A young fellow wishes to meet with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A young fellow?”
Daomother Devilhand was puzzled. “Who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ji Ning kid,
who once forced me to bow my head before him…” The black-robed
Godking laughed softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
Daomother Devilhand nodded. “A mere Empyrean God/True Immortal.
Hurry up and deal with this minor matter. This war before us is the
critical pivot on which our chances of winning the war for karmic
luck shall turn. This is what truly matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, aunt-master,”
the black-robed Godking assented.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. An island atop the great Darknorth Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was viewing the
scenery before him. Although it was winter, the innate heat within
this island kept it in perpetual spring. The island blossomed with
flowers and was quite beautiful to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re going to
meet again soon. Our family will be reunited.” Ning still
remembered how she looked, all those years ago, when she stroked her
belly as she watched him train in the sword. That warm, loving
environment…ever since the destruction of Shennong’s medicine and
the shattering her soul, it had completely disappeared. For the sake
of getting it back, Ning had risked his life and had done everything
he could possibly do. Thankfully, he had been lucky enough to acquire
the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique, had been lucky
enough to possess powerful heartforce, and had been lucky enough that
senior Fuxi had created the Rahu Formation for him. This was the
reason why he had been able to force the Seamless Gate to bow its
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…he and his
daughter was going to be reunited with his wife. The three of them
would be reunited once more, as a family.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple of power
descended. Startled, Ning turned his head to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed man was
standing at the end of an upraised path in the distance. The
black-robed man sauntered towards him, a smile on his face. “This
island isn’t bad. It’s quite beautiful. Your Primaltwin remains
on the Deerchaser world, but your true body has appeared. It seems
you have emerged from Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” The black-robed Godking nodded, letting out a sigh of
praise. “To tell you the truth, Ji Ning…although the two of us
are on enemy sides, I admit I’m quite shocked and impressed that
you were able to emerge from Undermoon Lake in just six hundred short
years. Jueming entered during the Primordial Era and was only able to
escape during the Three Realms era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “I’ve
emerged. Isn’t it time for you to hold to your promise?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you bring the
treasures I asked for?” The black-robed Godking laughed, “Per
what I originally said, I would only release Yu Wei’s soul to you
once you gave the treasures to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I brought them.”
Ning’s heartrate began to speed up uncontrollably, but he was able
to remain calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust that you
have the other two treasures…but what of the Iceheart Leaf?” The
black-robed Godking laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand. A
semi-transparent, crystalline Iceheart Leaf suddenly appeared,
levitating above his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is an
Iceheart Leaf.” The black-robed Godking inspected it carefully, a
slightly intoxicated look in his eyes. “It really is quite
beautiful, just as the legends said it to be. This is my first time
to see an Iceheart Leaf in person. Mmm…alright. You can destroy it
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Destroy it?”
Ning’s heart sank. What was the meaning of this? Why was he being
told to bring, then destroy the Iceheart Leaf?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I’ve seen
it, it’s of no further use to me.” The black-robed Godking looked
at Ning. “I just wanted the chance to look at it, that’s all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I brought you the
treasures that you asked for. Please give my senior
apprentice-sister’s soul back to me,” Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha….” The
black-robed Godking let out an ear-piercing laugh, an uproarious
laugh, a crazy laugh. He laughed so hard, tears nearly came out of
his eyes. His entire body trembled from laughter as he pointed a
quavering hand at Ning. “Oh, Ji Ning, Ji Ning…and to think that
you are a ‘peerless genius of this age’. Haven’t you understood
yet? When I told you to get me Iceheart Leaf, I simply wanted to
force you into Undermoon Lake. The leaf, the other treasures…although
they are of some use to me as a Daofather, they are meaningless to
the Seamless Gate as a whole. Did you really think I would care about
those three treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I wanted was for
you to enter Undermoon Lake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although you managed
to emerge after six hundred years…it was enough. It was enough. Our
‘Three Realms infiltration phase’ is complete. Our Seamless Gate
is battling gainst your Nuwa Alliance on the Deerchaser world, and
soon the entire war for karmic luck will be at an end. The
infiltration phase is over. It no longer matters.” The black-robed
Godking roared with laughter. “If you came out after just one or
two centuries, I’d probably have to come up with something else,
but six hundred years? You are no longer a threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No threat at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nowadays, our
Seamless Gate’s forces are sent out in massive armies. You, a mere
True Immortal with that feeble Rahu-something formation…what can
you possibly do?” The black-robed Godking continued to roar with
ear-piercing laughter like a madman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Years ago, the Godking
had been forced by Ning to bow his head. The Godking had been enraged
to the point of wanting to kill Ning, but it wasn’t appropriate for
him to personally act. However, the chance to see Ning enraged, see
Ning feel despair…that would be even more delightful than simply
killing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the black-robed
Godking laughed with abandon, he kept a careful watch over Ning,
noting every single change in expression. He wanted to see Ning’s
face become filled with panic and despair. Only then would the demon
in his heart be satisfied! Other Immortal cultivators might be afraid
of their dark side, but the Godking was a cultivator of Lord
Demonheart’s arts. He himself was the veritable incarnation of a
mental devil, while his master was the Lord of the Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…he was
disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there.
Stood there, not reacting at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack. Something
suddenly seemed to shatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That woman who had
quietly, blissfully watched with a smile on her face as Ning had
trained in the sword…she was never coming back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt agonizing
pain in his heart. Pain that made him feel nauseous. Pain that was
about to drive him insane. He wanted to laugh…he wanted to roar…but
he couldn’t make any sound at all. For many years now, the karmic
sinflames had been constantly burning against his body, but Ning had
never cared about the pain they brought. In this moment, however…the
pain he felt was ten thousand times greater than the pain from the
karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ha…haha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a dry laugh
rattled out from Ning’s mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He sounded almost like
a toddler who had just learned how to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aha…ahaha…ahahaha….”
Ning began to laugh wildly. He finally began to laugh, and his tears
finally began to fall as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this, the
black-robed Godking finally let out a satisfied smile. This was more
like it. This was the reaction he had expected. For a brief moment,
just now, the man hadn’t been reacting at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…I knew all
along that you weren’t worthy of my trust…” Ning’s eyes were
completely bloodshot now. He laughed wildly, “I knew it all along.
You, ‘Godking’, you toy with the hearts of men, causing chaos
throughout the Three Realms. How could your promises be worth
believing? But I still chose to believe, and I even entered Undermoon
Lake, doing everything I could to return as soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I even impatiently
ran over here to hand those three treasures over to you. I knew that
your promises were as worthless as dogshit…but I still came. I held
onto hope. A tiny shred of hope…hope…hope that she would be able
to come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hoped that she
would be able to come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon and I…we
miss her. I want our family to be together again. That’s all I
want. My family to be together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you…finally…you
have finally destroyed my last bit of hope. You destroyed it.” Ning
laughed so madly, he was shaking. “Ahaha…it was all just wishful
thinking…I was just dreaming. I was lying to myself this entire
time. Lying to myself. Telling myself that we could still be
together. What a joke. I am such a joke. A joke!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
could sense how the heart of the youth before him had shattered.
Could sense his agony. His despair. The destruction of that last
shred of hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking…was
satisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was more like it.
This was true agony. This was true heartbreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking looked at
Ning. “It is time for you to wake up. You need to understand that
at this current stage of the war, a single Empyrean God like you
cannot have any impact at all. By now, only a large number of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals joined together will have any
effect. Still…I’m a man who appreciates talent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll once more
invite you to join the Seamless Gate. So long as you are willing to
join us, you’ll immediately be able to reunite with your wife.
Don’t you wish to be with her? Don’t you wish for your daughter
to reunite with her mother? If you join the Seamless Gate, it will
all happen. As a member of the Seamless Gate, you’ll be one of
us…and I’ll naturally stop plotting against you. In fact, I’ll
be quite good to you. You are a true expert amongst Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, after all. Although you won’t be able to change the
course of the entire war for karmic luck, you’ll still be of some
use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you join the
Seamless Gate now, you’ll be able to reunite with your wife. But if
you refuse…well. She’ll be of no further use to me. I’ll kill
her. I’ll shatter her soul. Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have no other
choices.” The black-robed Godking looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning…was still bent
over with laughter. “Joke. I’m a joke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” Ning
straightened his back, raising his head to stare unblinkingly at the
black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Godking’s heart skipped a beat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What sort of a look was
that? Such powerful heartforce…such a terrible gaze. If this was
the gaze of an ordinary mortal, the Godking wouldn’t care at all,
but this was Ji Ning, who had reached the fourth stage of heartforce.
The black-robed Godking could sense that behind that gaze, there was
an endless, blazing, burning hatred that not all the waters of the
Three Realms would suffice to quench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A desire to kill that
had seeped into his spirit…his very truesoul itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for
destroying my hopes. Thank you for bringing my wishful thoughts to an
end. Thank you…for freeing me from all my doubts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take it
slow, you and I. The day is still young. Soon…I will make sure to
properly thank you for all you have done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Ning
turned and left, transforming into a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you refuse, your
wife will be useless to me. I will kill her,” the black-robed
Godking immediately howled after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My wife is already
dead. I killed her!” Ning’s voice echoed in the air, but he
himself had already departed from the Grand Xia.

Chapter 13 - A Month From Now
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
stood there at the island, staring into the skies. Ji Ning had
already departed from this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-robed Godking laughed coldly. “He cares deeply about love,
and yet is able to sever it. Quite an impressive figure. During
ordinary times, I might need to be concerned about you…but now? The
war is in full swing. Soon, even the major powers shall begin to die
in large swathes. A single Empyrean God…nothing more than a minor
character.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black-robed
Godking left behind as well. The only thing left behind was that
beautiful island, where countless flowers continued to bloom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Seamless Citadel. Daomother Devilhand and the black-robed Godking
continued to stare at their army, spread throughout the vast
wilderness. Their army was calling out for battle, but the Nuwa
Alliance refused to come out and fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little kid.”
The black-robed Godking suddenly let out a low, cold chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daomother
Devilhand looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
black-robed Godking laughed, “Just now, I sent one of my
incarnations to go meet with him. I toyed with him for a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
said calmly, “Given how far the war for karmic luck has advanced, a
single Empyrean God like him is no longer a threat to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know. That’s why
there’s no way I would possibly give Yu Wei’s soul back to him.
Even if it’s useless to me, Ji Ning can forget about getting it,”
the black-robed Godking said with a calm laugh. “Don’t worry,
aunt-master. I won’t spend too much of my time on that kid. The big
picture is what really matters, and the issue before us is the war
for karmic luck. As for that Ji Ning? If an opportunity arises, I’ll
use it to dispose of him. If no opportunity comes, then I won’t
bother with him. Spending time and effort on him is a waste of my
energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. It’s good that
you know what matters.” Daomother Devilhand nodded calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Boom. Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their army flew through
the air in an awe-inspiring horde that covered the skies as they
returned to the Seamless Citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-robed Godking raised his head. He saw a distant black bolt of
lightning flash in the skies, followed by a streak of light flying
into the distant, hovering citadel of the Nuwa Alliance. The Godking
cracked his lips into a grin. “It’s Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser world.
The hanging citadel of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The white-robed
Ning waved his hand, and the black-robed Ning in front of him was
drawn into the portable estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world inside the
treasure was an entire world of its own, with mountain peaks soaring
into the skies. There were a total of 319 mountain peaks, which
served as the ‘foundational pillars’ of this world, ensuring its
stability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A number of white-robed
youths were all seated on their respective mountain peaks, training
in the [Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seventeen black-robed
Ning’s appeared as well. As with his true bodies, Ning had only
brought seventeen of his Primaltwin clones here. He had left one
behind to accompany his daughter, Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooooosh. Ninefire
Lava and Iceheart Pith began to fly out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventeen
black-robed Ning’s separated from each other, each occupying a
mountain peak of their own. They then began to train in the [Icefire
Jindan Smelting] technique as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘original’
white-robed Ning remained standing within that distant courtyard. He
waved his hand, and instantly a large horde of people appeared within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is this
place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
we’ve been waiting for centuries. You’ve finally let us out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Where are we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The throng of Empyrean
Gods that had just appeared were Empyrean Gods Sin and Sealthroat,
the Seven Dragon Gods, Empyrean God Feiyou, Empyrean God Cloudscar,
and the rest of the two hundred-plus Empyrean Gods of Undermoon Lake.
Each of them was extraordinarily powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…the
Deerchaser major world?” Empyrean God Roughpeak suddenly said,
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deerchaser?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve returned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods
quickly grew excited by this revelation. They each began to spread
out their coresense, causing the already-present Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals of the Nuwa Alliance to notice them…and realize to
their astonishment that these coresenses seemed to be of old friends
and brothers that they had not seen for a long, long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, quite a few
Empyrean Gods hastened to Ning’s place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!? Oddwitch, it
really is you! I thought my senses were fooling me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“S-senior
apprentice-brother! Y-you…are still alive!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s residence
quickly became quite a lively place…and in the commotion, no one
noticed that Ning had quietly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Traveling alone, Ning
headed towards the palace where Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan resided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were guards
outside the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth, there are many major powers who are convening inside right
now. They must not be disturbed,” a golden-armored guard said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me relay a
message. Tell them that I have extremely important information for my
master,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
guard was slightly startled. If Ning had insisted on seeing Xuan
Yuan, he would’ve stopped him, but since Ning just wanted to meet
with his own master…it wasn’t really appropriate for him to stand
in the way. He immediately nodded. “Empyrean God Darknorth, just
wait a moment. I’ll send the word right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He stood
there quietly, waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Xuan Yuan,
Suiren, and other major powers were all gathered here. If Ning wished
to meet them, he naturally would have to act in a proper manner and
pay his respects accordingly. He couldn’t just sweep out his
heartforce or send a mental message to them from afar; that would be
far too brash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the golden-armored guard returned. He gave Ning a curious look. “His
Imperial Majesty said to let you in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had made the
report, Xuan Yuan, Daoist Three Purities, and the others all said the
same thing: ‘Let Ji Ning come in.’ This caused this guard, who
was merely a Celestial Immortal, to be extremely puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
stepped forward onto the stairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He walked through the
corridor, passing into an extremely wide plaza as he walked towards a
great hall. Even before entering, Ning was able to make out the
seated figures within the great hall. All of them were major powers
of the Three Realms. There weren’t that many of them here. This was
mainly because all of the major powers had hastened here after the
appearance of the Envoy of All Things. After their day of initial
discussions, some of the major powers had left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Xuan
Yuan’s voice rang out, and Ning entered the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There really weren’t
that many True Gods/Daofathers inside, just eighteen in total.
However, the most puissant powers were all present. Daoist Three
Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Shennong, Fuxi, and Suiren were
all present. Subhuti was seated there as well, and he nodded towards
Ning. He was responsible for keeping watch over the Seamless Gate’s
actions, and so he already knew of Ning’s meeting with the Godking
and knew what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t help but
sigh. He knew that his disciple’s path was a hard one, but one
which only his disciple himself could walk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Xuan
Yuan smiled. “We learned just a moment ago that you brought more
than two hundred Empyrean Gods back from Undermoon Lake. And…I can
sense that all of them have extremely powerful auras. All of them are
top-tier Empyrean Gods, and some of them are quite shockingly
powerful. To gain the allegiance of such a group of Empyrean Gods
during the war for karmic luck is helpful for our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You came out after
six centuries. You were much faster than Jueming,” Lord Tathagata
said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.” Subhuti
spoke out. “Why have you sought me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major powers
were watching Ning. Even the weakest of these eighteen were elite
Daofathers! Before Ning had arrived, they were pondering the question
of how to deal with the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just brought
them two hundred more Empyrean Gods, which was quite a pleasing bit
of news to them, as many of these Empyrean Gods were their disciples.
But this was just an emotional bit of pleasure. They knew very well
that the addition of these Empyrean Gods would have very little
impact on the big picture. In the last battle alone, they had lost
nearly six hundred!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Envoy, using
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals against it was useless. Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals had to rely on formations in order to unleash
sufficient amounts of power. True Immortal Jimin, commanding a Pangu
Genesis Formation, had already reached what they believed to be the
theoretical maximum level of power that could be unleashed by an
Empyrean God or True Immortal when wielding a formation. They
couldn’t come up with any better ideas at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Envoy of All
Things,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Envoy?”
Subhuti was startled. All the major powers were startled. The only
reason why they had been willing to meet with Ning was to thank him
for having rescued so many Empyrean Gods…but now, all of them
instantly turned quite serious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can the Seamless
Gate eavesdrop or spy on this location…?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
many major powers of the Three Realms are all gathered here, and we
have each employed our own methods to block out spying. Even the
Heavenly Daos themselves have been blocked off,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. A
moment later, he realized that this was true. He couldn’t even
sense the Heavenly Daos in this place. This was testament to how
agitated he was, that he hadn’t even noticed this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Subhuti
looked at his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Envoy of All
Things is quite formidable. However, your disciple’s clones have
departed Undermoon Lake after six hundred years, and all memories
have been joined together once more. Your disciple has a way to deal
with the Envoy of All Things,” Ning said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have a way?”
Exalted Celestial Thundregod, seated nearby, frowned. Although he
didn’t like Ji Ning, this was something that had to do with the
survival of their alliance. He wholeheartedly wanted to come up with
a solution for dealing with the Envoy, but none of the major powers
present had come up with any ideas. For Ji Ning to suddenly claim
that he had a solution caused Thundergod to frown. “Are you aware
that the Envoy of All Things is comparable to a elite Daofather in
power? You, an Empyrean God, have a method of dealing with it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Envoy of
All Things appeared, I was by Master’s side on the city walls,”
Ning said respectfully. The meaning of this was clear; he knew
exactly how powerful the Envoy was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really have an
idea?” Yu the Great, the founder of the Primordial Imperial Clan,
was seated close by. He couldn’t help but ask this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, his eyes
filled with unprecedented self-confidence and determination. “Elders,
please give me just a month. A month from now, I, Ji Ning…shall go
and deal with the Envoy of All Things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“War is not a joking
matter. This will have implications for the lives of countless
Immortals and Fiendgods.” The commander of their army, Xuan Yuan,
spoke out in a solemn voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior wouldn’t
dare to make such a joke.” Ning spoke out in an equally solemn
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Xuan Yuan
nodded. “I trust that you know that in war, one cannot make idle
promises. Since you’ve promised it, a month from now I will order
our army to once more battle the Seamless Gate.”

Chapter 14 - True Body
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning departed
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme figures of
the Nuwa Alliance within the hall watched as Ning departed. They then
exchanged glances. Clearly, they all had their doubts and concerns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone…do you
believe that Darknorth truly has a solution?” Exalted Celestial
Thundergod couldn’t but say, “It’s not that I look down on him;
rather, we all know exactly how powerful the Envoy is. When the Lord
of All Things led his army of Envoys, he nearly wiped out both the
Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld. Fortunately, Mother
Nuwa made her breakthrough and swept through all challengers.
Although this Envoy before us is merely under the command of an
Empyrean God, it still definitely has the power of a elite Daofather.
Ji Ning…I really can’t imagine how he can come up with any
solution.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t imagine it
either. What could he possibly do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that his
swordforce or his heartforce has reached the fifth stage?” Emperor
Zhuanxu frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage
isn’t that easy to reach. Swordforce and heartforce increase
exponentially in difficulty with each stage. The fifth stage is
harder to reach than becoming a True God or Daofather.” Xuan Yuan
slowly shook his head. “He’s just returned from Undermoon Lake.
My best guess is that he must’ve acquired some sort of treasure in
Undermoon Lake. Something which allows him, an Empyrean God and True
Immortal, to be able to unleash the power of a elite Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can such a treasure
truly exist?” Exalted Celestial Thundergod was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They do. For
example…” Xuan Yuan said softly, “The Envoy of All Things! If
Ji Ning also had an Envoy, given the power he displayed in overcoming
Undermoon Lake, he could probably defeat the enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, we’ve
been guessing all along that Undermoon Lake was created by an ancient
major power, yes?” Xuan Yuan chuckled. “That major power must
have been shockingly powerful; it’s not impossible that he might’ve
left behind a golem comparable to an Envoy of All Things. But of
course, that’s just a guess. The other possibility is that Ji Ning
is so infuriated that he’s completely overestimated himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is an
Empyrean God and True Immortal; there’s no way he would be that
unreliable.” Shennong frowned as he spoke in a calm voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person who knows
Ji Ning best is his master.” Fuxi looked towards Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present looked
towards Subhuti. Quite a few people had spoken, but thus far Subhuti
had yet to say a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti frowned, then
said slowly, “Xuan Yuan…it’s best if you still make
preparations in the event of defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Xuan Yuan was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hearts of everyone
present sunk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti said nothing
else. He didn’t want to reveal all of Ning’s secrets to everyone!
Still, in Subhuti’s heart, he was indeed a bit nervous. He knew
that throughout the course of history, from the Primordial Era to the
present day, the word ‘love’ had caused quite a few major powers
to be driven mad. Even Houyi, whose heartforce had reached the fifth
stage, was unable to escape from this word, ‘love’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti himself wasn’t
sure as to how heavy a mental blow Ning had been delivered by what
had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I’ll make
complete preparations.” Xuan Yuan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News of the return of
more than two hundred Empyrean Gods quickly spread throughout the
Three Realms. The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Three
Realms all heard that the return of all these people was thanks to Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, in the
Celestial Realm. Mount Ling, in the eastern lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming’s
palace was a simple, plain, unadorned one. There were only two novice
monks here, guarding the entrance. He only became truly famous in the
Three Realms after returning from Undermoon Lake, then training to
become a True God and Daofather. Ever since then, he had never caused
much of a stir, as he had lived here in seclusion by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Buddha
Jueming was seated in the lotus position. Slowly, he opened his eyes.
“Undermoon Lake? Empyrean God Darknorth overcame Undermoon Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has Darknorth also
acquired [Forlorn World God] and [Nine Elements Annihilation]?”
Buddha Jueming mused to himself. The [Forlorn World God]…it was
indeed the best Fiendgod Body Refiner technique that World God
Northrest had access to which could be taught to others. Right now,
Ning was indeed training in the [Forlorn World God].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The key to this
technique lay in the word ‘Forlorn’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One would have to
search through endless solitude and dullness in order to find the
secrets regarding the divine body, then make the breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, in order to train
in this technique, what one truly needed was silence and calm.
Sometimes, a single ‘forlorn’ meditation session could span ten
thousand years or a million years. Buddha Jueming himself was
perpetually seated in the meditative posture, and thus he naturally
understood the profound secrets to this art. Long ago, it was this
art which he used to break through to become a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So, there is now yet
another cultivator of the [Nine Elements Annihilation] and the
[Forlorn World God],” Buddha Jueming mused to himself. “The power
of this divine ability is truly endless; the only thing one really
needs is a long period of time to meditate on it. Unfortunately,
Darknorth hasn’t spent enough time cultivating. Otherwise, he would
be of tremendous benefit in this war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longer one
cultivated, the more powerful he realized the [Forlorn World God] and
the [Nine Elements Annihilation] to be. These two techniques alone
were enough to allow one to become an unparalleled expert amongst
Elder Gods, and perhaps even break through to the World God stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News that Ji Ning was
about to enter the fray was kept completely secret. Even the other
major powers of the Nuwa Alliance such as Buddha Jueming were not
informed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones who knew
were the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism, the Three Emperors, and
around ten-plus other major powers. Although they were worried that
Ning would fail, they still felt a hint of hope. Naturally, they
would keep this a tight secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day at
a time. In the blink of an eye, a month had gone by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world of
towering mountain peaks. Ning’s seventeen true body clones and
seventeen Primaltwin clones had all gathered here, at the very top of
one of the mountain peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Jindan smelting
process is complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to train in the
[One True Body] technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventeen
white-robed youths all sat down in the lotus position together.
Slowly, the bodies of two of them began to emit a hazy white light.
Their bodies, their Jindans, and their souls were all emanating this
hazy white light which was filled with arcane, abstruse divine runes.
Ning was completely, slavishly imitating the technique and runes as
it had been written down. This technique had been created by a major
power of the primordial chaos, and its runes were incredibly profound
and mysterious. There was no way Ning could understand these runes at
all; all he had to do was memorize them and then replicate them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two white-robed
youths began to slowly draw closer to each other. One of them
actually ended up flying into the body of the other, causing the aura
of white light to dramatically expand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an extremely
slow and very relaxed, comfortable process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a baby bird
sleeping inside the egg shell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a baby
child sleeping within the mother’s womb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ball of white light
completely surrounded the blurry figure. In this moment, all thought
was impossible. Clearly, the Jindan, soul, and bodies had all begun
to merge together. Only things that had come from the same source
could merge together in such a manner. The divine bodies, Jindans,
and souls of these clones were all absolutely identical. There were
no differences whatsoever!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there was even the
slightest bit of difference, the merger would become impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning’s
Primaltwin had been formed through a Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater.
Thus, there were a major differences between it and Ning’s true
body. And so, there was no way whatsoever for the Primaltwin and the
true body to merge together! But of course, the eighteen Primaltwin
clones could all merge into each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blurry white light
completely faded away, withdrawing into the remaining clone’s body.
The white-robed figure emerged once more, and it once more became
capable of thought. As Ning regained his senses, he could immediately
sense how his body had changed. “My divine power has transformed in
some way. The Pure Yang energy in my Jindan has become more pure, and
the Jindan region has expanded in size by a bit. My soul has become
more powerful as well…even my heartforce has grown considerably
stronger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When two completely
identical souls fused together, the resultant soul would of course be
much stronger. This sort of fusion would result in an upgrade in
every single aspect and area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, when the King
of Pangaea had been an Elder God, he had relied on mastering the
complete [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] to join his clones together,
allowing him to surpass other Elder Gods in every single aspect. It
had given him overwhelmingly superior power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another white-robed
youth was drawn into the first one’s body. The first clone’s body
continued to rise in power, and the soul, divine power, heartforce,
and Pure Yang energy all continued to evolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One clone after another
was absorbed into the first one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [One True Body]
technique relied on the fact that all the clones originated from the
same source. This was the reason why the technique could work. The
more clones were absorbed, the more powerful one would become. If
Ning had been able to train in the even more ridiculous [Thousand
Bodies Sutra], he would’ve been able to fuse a thousand clones
together. The increase in power would be even more ridiculous, in
that case, allowing an Empyrean God to become the equivalent of a
True God, and a True God to become the equivalent of an Elder God. An
Elder God would become the equivalent of a World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what made the
[Thousand Bodies Sutra] to be such an unearthly, almighty technique!
But alas, the price of training in this technique was simply too
great. For even a weak Empyrean God to train in it would require a
Worldheart to be consumed. The price that would need to be paid for
someone more powerful would be truly incalculable. Which World God
would be willing to part with a Worldheart, giving it away to an
Empyrean God for cultivation? Even if the Empyrean God was to
succeed, that person would still be tremendously weak and unable to
help the World God at all. It would only make a difference if the
Empyrean God was able to train all the way to become an Elder God…but
in the path of Immortal cultivation, advancing through every single
major stage saw tremendous difficulties. Far, far too many
cultivators were washed out at each stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each merger, Ning
continued to transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, all seventeen
white-robed youths had merged into one. Into one true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
sensation.” Ning looked at his surroundings. His soul was now far
more powerful than it had been before, and even the rate at which he
gained insights into the Dao was now far faster. Even though he
previously was able to simultaneously train with thirty-six different
bodies, the speed at which he gained insights was less than his
current speed, after his one true body had been formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…is this the
level of Daofathers?” Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seventeen clones, each
of which had second-tier Jindans. Now that they had merged together
into one true body, the power of the Jindan inside his body was
comparable to first-tier Jindans! True Immortals of Pangaea with
first-tier Jindans were indeed on the same level of power as the
Daofathers of the Three Realms, and in fact they actually had deeper
reservoirs of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My energy is on the
level of a Daofather’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine body has
surpassed the limits of an Empyrean God; it can be considered a
half-step into the True God level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My soul…it should
have thirty to forty percent of the might of an ordinary Daofather’s
soul. In order for my soul to reach the level of a true Daofather,
I’ll need to spend another century nourishing it. Of my seventeen
clones, two had long ago gained second-tier Jindans, and so their
souls had been nourished significantly. The other fifteen had only
just recently upgraded to second-tier Jindans. Their souls didn’t
have enough time to evolve.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
principle. Still…it was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body’s soul
was already more than a hundred times stronger than that of an
ordinary True Immortal’s. Daofathers could easily cover the Three
Realms with the coresense, while Ning could perhaps just barely do
the same, if he went all out. As for Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals? They generally were only capable of covering a major world
with their coresense. From this, one could easily see the difference
in soul power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to
Daofather Holyflame…let’s see. We have equivalent levels of
energy. I have more technically profound sword-arts, but his have
been infused with the Heavenly Dao of Fire. However…I have a
Darknorth sword that is a Chaos weapon.” Ning nodded to himself.
“In terms of power…my true body should be comparable to Daofather
Holyflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were to use the
Rahu Formation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would be given a
divine body that was comparable to that of a elite Daofather. In that
case, my total power would surpass Daofather Holyflame’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defeating the Envoy
of All Things will be simplicity itself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed his aura to
be retracted into his body. Instantly, the incredible aura of power
surrounding him, an aura comparable to a Daofather’s, was
completely retracted inside of him. This wasn’t the aura-hiding
technique which Subhuti had taught him; it was one of the many
techniques which World God Northrest had left behind for him. While
wandering the primordial chaos, one would easily perish if one’s
power was revealed for all others to know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate-world
treasure which Ning was within was something which he had acquired
from a True God of the prisonworld. Not even Elder Gods or Ancestral
Immortals would be able to spy on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look
towards the side. Next to him were the black-robed Ning’s, and they
were in the process of fusing together as well. Soon, they
transformed into a single black-robed Ning. This Ning also had the
power of a elite Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s not much
of a difference between fusing eighteen clones and fusing seventeen
clones. It’s best to leave one behind as a ‘seed’. If I’m
going to war against the Seamless Gate…best to remain cautious.”
Ning willed it, and with a swoosh he disappeared from the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starseizer major
world. A large shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We pay our respects
to you, Manorlord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Ninefangs
and Empyrean God Snow Scorpion, upon seeing Ning suddenly appear,
hastily bowed towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefangs, summon
the army immediately,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninefangs
immediately went to make the arrangements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has Redsnow left
seclusion?” Ning looked towards Snow Scorpion, who shook her head
and laughed. “Redsnow is still in seclusion. I really have no idea
when he will emerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush.” Ning
nodded, then immediately walked outside. Ninefangs remained the
weakest of the seven, and was also the last to become an Empyrean
God. Thus, he was also the most industrious of the seven, and many of
the miscellaneous tasks were left for him to handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the plaza before
the shrine became filled with a teeming horde of Celestial Immortals
and Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
emerged from the divine hall. Instantly, the throng of Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals turned their gazes towards him, Ji
Ning. They all called out respectfully, “Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation,” Ning commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
countless Immortals all flew into the air together. Ning flew to the
very center of the host of Immortals, and the energy of Heaven and
Earth began to flow into him in such a flow that it was affecting the
entire Starseizer world. An utterly ferocious, titanic Fiendgod began
to emerge. His body was pitch-black, but his lower back was covered
with extremely fine strands of silver fur. Six burly, thick arms grew
out from the body. Then, a head that was rather similar to Ning’s
own head grew out and emerged as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu God had
manifested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This body is far
more powerful than a True God’s body.” Ning’s six hands
clenched tightly into fists. Boom! Space itself was trembling.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 15 - To Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent. Using
Daofather-level energy to command the Rahu Formation is indeed much
easier. I’m able to control all of the natural energy which has
been summoned by these 90,000 Celestial Immortals and 8 million Loose
Immortals.” Ji Ning could sense the full power of the Rahu God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference between
his current Daofather-level energy and his former True Immortal-level
energy was simply enormous. For a True Immortal to command this
mighty formation was like forcing a child to lift up a large boulder.
A Daofather doing the same was like letting a strongman do the same.
With Ning’s fundamentals changed, the difficulty he faced in
controlling formation naturally changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that his soul was
now much more powerful as well…he was able to effortlessly command
the full force of the Rahu Formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate.” A
hint of a murderous look flashed through the Rahu-Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the levitating
castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ning had
appeared out of nowhere within Ning’s residence. The black-robed
Ning raised his head, staring into the skies. Large plumes of snow
had begun to drift downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s snowing,”
Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had met with
the Godking in the Grand Xia, it was in the heart of winter as well,
but back then Ning’s heart had been blazing with eagerness. But
now…it had become nothing short of an iceberg.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to meet
with senior Xuan Yuan.” The black-robed Ning walked out of his own
residence and towards Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s palace. While
walking over, he noted that the mood was quite gloomy. The Seamless
Gate had called for battle on numerous occasions, but the Nuwa
Alliance had yet to respond at all. This caused all of the Immortals
and Fiendgods on their side to worry…did they really have no
response at all for the Envoy of All Things? Although Ning chatted a
bit with the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals he met on the way, he
could sense the tremendous pressure his friends were under.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This war was one in
which the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would risk their lives,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the black-robed Ning reached Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth.” The golden-armored guard in front of the palace called
out to him, stopping him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please send the word
to his Imperial Majesty, the Yellow Emperor. Simply say that Ji Ning
is now prepared,” the black-robed Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
golden-armored guard nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three mighty
Sovereigns of Mankind were seated, as were the incarnations of the
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism and the true bodies of Xuan Yuan and
Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is now
prepared.” Xuan Yuan smiled as he looked towards Subhuti. “And…what
a powerful desire to kill he is radiating!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. It is quite
intense.” Subhuti murmured softly, “Although he is keeping it
suppressed deep in his heart…that’s what makes the intensity of
it so shocking. That’s why I told you to make preparations for
being defeated, just in case. Although I’ve always been very
confident in this disciple of mine, and although he’s never allowed
his personal emotions to get in the way of the big picture…we
really cannot afford to lose this fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. We cannot
afford to lose.” Shennong let out a sigh. “We have no other
options for dealing with the Envoy of All Things. We just don’t
have enough power. We have to rely on raw numbers to overwhelm it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our best
chance.” Suiren, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Ji Ning is
unsuccessful, we’ll carry out the plan we originally settled upon,”
Xuan Yuan said softly. That plan was a calamitous one. Xuan Yuan
stilled his emotions, then said, “I’ll assemble the army now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Everyone
present nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan immediately
instructed two of his disciples, “Give the order to assemble.
Prepare to enter combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The order was given.
The entire castle instantly exploded into motion as a veritable ocean
of Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, Celestial Immortals, and Loose
Immortals quickly began to gather together, assembling into great
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
isn’t even calling out for battle right now. For us to take the
initiative to attack…can it be that the major powers have already
come up with a way to deal with that ape-shaped monstrosity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re taking
the initiative to attack…the major powers might really have a
solution.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we don’t deal
with that ape-shaped aberration, it will be very hard to win. It’s
utterly impenetrable to weapons. Not even fellow Daoist Jimin’s
Pangu Genesis Formation was able to harm it in the slightest. If that
ape-shaped monstrosity is allowed to go wild…we are going to suffer
greatly for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They surely have a
solution.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals who were the commanders of the formation were
all chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Sovereigns,
the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism, Subhuti, and Xuan Yuan all
appeared. They flew through the air as Xuan Yuan called out in a
commanding voice, “Exit the citadel!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, awe-inspiring
army flew into the air as well, flying out of the floating citadel
and towards the distant wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuan Yuan and the rest
of the seven major powers stood atop the city walls, watching from
afar. Their disciples, Ning included, quickly assembled behind them
atop the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciples under
my command do not know that you are going to join the battle. Just
now, when I ordered the army to assemble, you weren’t notified.”
Xuan Yuan turned to look at the black-robed Ning. “You can go now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous, thirty
thousand meter tall Rahu God suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Its
face was Ji Ning’s face, and it held a pair of Darknorth swords in
its hands, one of which was the one which had become a Chaos
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning instantly
soared into the skies, heading towards the main army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu Formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is Ji Ning simply
going to use the Rahu Formation?” The faces of Xuan Yuan, Subhuti,
the Three Sovereigns, and the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism all
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew exactly what
the strengths and weaknesses of the Rahu Formation were, which made
them all the more nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…has he
really lost sight of the big picture?” The reason why Subhuti had
previously advised the other major powers to prepare for defeat was
simply because this battle was too important; they truly couldn’t
afford to lose this war. But upon seeing that Ning’s ‘special
ability’ seemingly just consisted of using the Rahu Formation,
Subhuti’s heart truly turned cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Rahu Formation…”
Fuxi spoke out. “I created this formation. It is an extremely
difficult one, and there aren’t even many Daofathers who are
capable of unleashing the full power of this formation. Only a
Daofather who has extremely strong heartforce and a soul heartforce
technique can truly unleash its power. Ji Ning has not become a
Daofather yet. If his meditations into the Dao began to resonate with
the Heavenly Daos, we would’ve sensed it long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Everyone
present nodded. Mastering a Heavenly Dao would cause a resonance with
the Heavenly Daos. It was something that was extremely difficult to
hide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is not a
Daofather, and he’s only capable of unleashing a small part of the
full power of the Rahu Formation. Even if his sword-arts are
extraordinary, he would at most be capable of matching an ordinary
Daofather.” Fuxi shook his head. “Even one of the Seamless
Infinity Formations would be able to completely suppress him. As for
the Envoy of All Things…that has the power of a elite Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it possible that
Ji Ning has something else planned?” Xuan Yuan couldn’t help but
ask this question. He still held hope in the words which Ning had
said a month ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s watch for
now.” Suiren was frowning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have the other Pangu
Genesis Formation be prepared,” Daoist Three Purities advised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Xuan Yuan
nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti didn’t say
anything else. He just watched from far away as the Rahu-Ning flew
towards the great army of the Nuwa Alliance, his eyes filled with
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the
Seamless Citadel. Daomother Devilhand and the black-robed Godking had
both appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance
actually dares to call us out for battle?” The Godking laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve called them
out so many times, but they refused to join battle. For them to
actively seek battle this time…they are simply trying to boost
their own morale,” Daomother Devilhand said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
nodded. “Master and I are fully aware of all their capabilities.
They’ve sent yet another five hundred Empyrean Gods and are most
likely prepared to form yet another Pangu Genesis Formation. Since
they can’t defeat the Envoy one-on-one, they’ve decided to try a
two-on-one. They should be planning to have the two Pangu Gods fight
against our Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guessed they would
do this.” Daomother Devilhand nodded. “It is much like how we
previously were using two Infinity Fiendgods to deal with the
Jimin-Pangu. However, there’s a fatal flaw to this plan; simply
put, they can’t fight for too long. No matter how well the two work
together, as the battle progresses, they will eventually make a
mistake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
black-robed Godking nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the two Pangu Gods
worked well together when fighting against the Envoy of All Things,
they’d be able to withstand it. But if their teamwork was poor…they
would be in a dangerous situation! The Envoy was utterly unbreakable;
not even the leaders of Buddhism or Daoism were capable of actually
destroying those terrifying golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look…” Daomother
Devilhand suddenly pointed towards a distant corner. Amongst a group
of many Seven Planets Gods, a six-armed Fiendgod had just appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?” The
black-robed Godking was stunned for a moment…and then he began to
laugh. “Ji Ning in a Fiendgod formation? Haha, that’s Ji Ning
using his Rahu Formation. Haha! Years ago, he relied on the Rahu
Formation to force me to bow my head and accede to his requests. He
hasn’t taken part in any of the fights of the past six centuries,
because he has been hoping that he would be able to rescue his senior
apprentice-sister from my clutches. Now that he’s given up, he’s
joining the fray. Right…the Grandmaster has instructed that if we
have the chance, we are to get rid of Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daomother
Devilhand nodded. “The big picture is what truly matters, but if we
have the chance, I’ll have the army pay Ji Ning some special
attention.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The army of the
Seamless Gate soared outwards, flying towards the distant wilderness
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One formation after
another began to assemble, and one golem after another began to land,
causing the earth to shake. The army of the Seamless Gate was filled
with extremely high morale, and in front of them led the ape-shaped
Envoy of All Things, its body wreathed with dark-red flames. Behind
him were two of the white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand armies of the
Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance faced each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers on
both sides watched nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
the Nuwa Alliance had come out to fight after retreating into their
citadel all those days ago! To both sides, this was a battle that
they could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you have
to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, don’t
fight against those formations head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, those two
white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgods have close to a elite
Daofather’s power. The Envoy of All Things is even more terrifying.
No matter what, don’t go close to it.” The Seven Planets Gods
near Ning all sent mental messages to him. Due to him rescuing the
two hundred-plus Empyrean Gods, there were many who were now much
more friendly towards him than before. Many Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals felt gratitude towards Ning for him saving their fellow
disciples and lifelong friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just nodded. “I
won’t be rash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to tell them
that he was going to deal with the Envoy of All Things, it would
probably cause a major disturbance. This was a critical battle; it
was best for these Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to be able to
remain calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the entire
Nuwa Alliance army began to charge forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the guidance of
Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan, all of them headed towards their respective
targets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you are
free to act as you see fit.” Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s orders
came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning suddenly
moved. He moved with extraordinary speed as he blazed through the
vast wilderness, going far past all the surrounding Seven Planets
Gods. The body of his Rahu God had the power of a elite Daofather,
giving him terrifying speed and strength. As he bound forward, he
actually became the vanguard of the entire army, charging in front of
everyone else and moving far beyond his allies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that fast?!”
The seven major powers on the city walls were all surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” The
black-robed Godking stared in shock as the Rahu-Ning charged straight
to the forefront.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 16 - The Number One Sword-Art of the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the black-robed
Godking was standing on the city walls, staring as the Rahu-Ning
charged forward at the very front of the army of the Nuwa Alliance,
Ji Ning also raised his head to stare towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes
collided…and the black-robed Godking’s heart clenched
momentarily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. He
seems to have improved a bit in power.” The black-robed Godking
laughed coldly. “Unfortunately, hatred seems to have fogged up his
mind. Doesn’t he know that in a war, you need to rely on the power
of your allies? To charge all by yourself towards the enemy is the
same as throwing yourself into a deadly trap. Who do you think you
are? An Envoy of All Things? Do you really think you can dominate all
comers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, everyone on
both armies had noticed that the Rahu-Ning had charged to the very
forefront of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has he gone mad?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That must be Ji
Ning, right? In years past, he roamed the Three Realms and
slaughtered quite a few Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of our
Seamless Gate. How dare he act so brashly on the field of battle as
well? Let’s surround him and kill him. Dealing with him will be
effortless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is seeking
out death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the great army of
the Seamless Gate saw the Rahu-Ning charge towards them, they all
believed that this quite well-known Empyrean God Darknorth had gone
mad. Every so often, there were some people who would go absolutely
berserk on the battlefield; Empyrean God Silvermoon, for example, had
done just the same during the last fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, you must not advance so hastily!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slow it down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let yourself
be surrounded by the enemies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals of the Nuwa Alliance who were behind Ning all called
out to him in worry…but alas, Ning was far too fast, and there was
no way for them to catch up at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind howled past his
ear, and space itself was rippling before him. Twin swords in hands,
the Rahu-Ning bound forward through the desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you, go
slow him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Infinity Fiendgod,
go and kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
almost instantly gave her orders. Ning had charged to the very
forefront of the battle, and so Daomother Devilhand could easily
arrange for her forces to intercept and kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the two
closest violet-light golems charged towards Ning, their heavy
footsteps causing the ground to tremble. One of the golems bellowed
furiously, “Darknorth, you are courting death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imbeciles.” The
Rahu-Ning howled through the air, meeting them in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Darknorth swords
struck out simultaneously. Once they did…the faces of the major
powers on both sides of the battle completely changed. Daomother
Devilhand, the black-robed Godking, Subhuti, Xuan Yuan, Daoist Three
Purities, Shennong…the faces of each and every one of them changed.
They were all incredibly experienced figures, and they naturally were
able to tell at one glance how terrifying Ji Ning’s sword-arts
were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
sword-art.” The black-robed Godking was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-art…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two streaks of
sword-light were like two bolts of endless lightning as they tore
through spac, carrying an unstoppable amount of force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two controllers of
the violet-light golems had previously been quite confident, as these
golems were as tough as magic treasures and thus perfectly suited to
tying down foes. Even if a Daofather attacked, it would be difficult
for the Daofather to injure them. These golems had bodies that were
just as tough as a body of one who had reached the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But when those two
streaks of sword-light lit up…the two True Immortals commanding the
golems were completely stunned. Their hearts began to quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heav-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They sought to block,
but the two streaks of sword-light landed on their bodies. The two
violet-light golems were knocked flying backwards, almost instantly
being sent back into the ranks of the Seamless Gate’s armies. But
they didn’t stop there; they continued to flip backwards
uncontrollably at high speed. Soon, they were far behind the main
army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence! Deathly
stillness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
instantly ground to halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone else was
stunned and silenced…but Ning acted as though he had simply kicked
away two little pebbles. Showing no emotions at all, he continued to
charge towards the Seamless Gate’s army at a terrifying level of
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Atop
the city walls, Daomother Devilhand had an ugly look on her face. “He
is very powerful. Extremely powerful. He’s probably close to a
elite Daofather in strength! The ‘Life and Death Formations of the
Twin Realm Calamity Dragons’ are comparatively weak, defensively
speaking. If he’s allowed to charge into the army and into those
formations, he’ll probably be able to break through them. As for
the Infinity Fiendgod, it’s still some distance away from him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had instructed
those two golems to tie down Ning, so as to allow one of the
white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgods enough time to get there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Infinity Fiendgods
were located at the very center of the entire army, alongside the
Envoy of All Things. Thus, they were fairly far away from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Infinity
Formation! Hurry up and stop Ji Ning. Tie him down and work with the
Infinity Fiendgod to kill him!” Daomother Devilhand immediately
gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Seamless
Infinity Formation nearest Ning immediately flew towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, awe-inspiring
Seamless Infinity Formation was surrounded by a region of primordial
chaos, and a layer of endless black clouds radiated from them as
well. They all surged straight towards Ning. The Seamless Infinity
Formation would be able to fight against even actual True Gods and
Daofathers without fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each Seamless Infinity
Formation was formed from 289 Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. It
was the ‘king’ of the Seamless Chaosworld who had created this
technique, and he did so with the purpose of allowing Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals to be able to fight back against True Gods and
Daofathers. Its strength lay in trapping powerful foes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is crazy.
He’s actually charging straight for the formation.” Atop the city
walls, the black-robed Godking shook his head at what he was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, awe-inspiring
Seamless Infinity Formation came crashing towards Ning. Ning’s six
arms now each wielded a sword, and he ran forward like a streak of
light, charging straight towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main army of the
Nuwa Alliance was still far behind him, frantically trying to catch
up. The main army of the Seamless Gate was watching from afar as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both armies were
staring at this sight. They were staring as the Rahu-Ning was about
to collide with the Seamless Infinity Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to block
me?” The towering Rahu-Ning watched as the endless black clouds
moved closer and closer to him. The outlines of the Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals within the black cloud could be vaguely seen, and all
of them were staring icily towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more struck
out with a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just one strike from a
single sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword was the
Chaos-level Darknorth sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a bolt of
lightning had suddenly filled Heaven and Earth! No…it was even
faster than a lightning bolt! The ‘indestructible’ Seamless
Infinity Formation that was ‘perfect for trapping foes’…in the
face of this strike, it was like a black air bubble that was
instantly pierced straight through and popped! One of the Empyrean
Gods struck by the sword-light was instantly disintegrated, and the
entire Seamless Infinity Formation completely broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The black air
bubble completely shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-art was the
fastest, most penetrating sword technique Ning had…the Blood Drop
stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
Empyrean God Tongxun, the leader of the formation, was suffering a
complete mental breakdown. “The Seamless Infinity Formation was
broken apart with a single sword-strike? T-this is impossible..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Save us! Save us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 288 Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals were all mentally shattered by this attack. If
even the Seamless Infinity Formation couldn’t withstand that
sword…now that the formation was gone, they would be like easily
slaughtered ants. Right now, their greatest regret was the fact that
the Rahu-Ning actually had six arms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those six arms swept
out with a sword in each hand. Sword-light flashed everywhere,
massacring them at an incredible speed. The Rahu-Ning slaughtered his
way from one end of the formation to the other, and more than 180
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals perished on the spot! The only
reason there were any survivors at all was because Ning wasn’t
trying to wipe them all out…because his attention was fully focused
on the white-haired, red-eyed Infinity Fiendgod that was charging
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the city walls,
Daofather Subhuti let out an exclamation as he saw that distant,
utterly dazzling sword-strike that was far more terrifying than a
mere thunderbolt. He was so excited that he actually pounded the
stone railings in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
sword-art. What a fast and terrifying sword-art!” Yellow Emperor
Xuan Yuan’s face had completely changed. “A sword that surpasses
the limits of the Heavenly Daos. No; that’s not all. His sword-art
carried a strange vortex with it, making it move even faster and have
even more penetrative power. Such a terrifying sword-art actually
exists in the three Realms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A fine sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did he master the
[Five Treasures]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sword-strike
alone is proof that Ning has power comparable to that of a elite
Daofather. He’s absolutely capable of being a match for the Envoy
of All Things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the battle
had begun, the major powers of the Nuwa Alliance had been feeling
quite nervous. Now, all of them began to let out surprised
exclamations. Perhaps ordinary Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
couldn’t tell, but they could; Ji Ning’s sword-arts hadn’t
‘simply’ surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos, they also
innately contained profound mysteries that were incomparably exalted.
A sword-art like this could absolutely be described as the number one
sword-art of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number one
sword-art of the Three Realms.” Suiren’s voice was deep and
gravelly, but his eyes contained a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-art is
indeed the best in the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Sovereigns
all concurred on this. Even Lord Buddha and Daoist Three Purities
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nearby
Daofather Subhuti, when he heard his old friends praise his disciple
in such a way, he couldn’t help but reveal a grin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, atop
the walls of the Seamless Citadel, the black-robed Godking and
Daomother Devilhand were just as astonished. When the black-robed
Godking saw that dazzling, absolutely terrifying sword-stroke, his
heart had instantly sunk. This was going to be trouble!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re in trouble.”
The black-robed Godking began to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand’s
face was utterly ashen, but she quickly sent a mental message to the
Infinity Fiendgod. “Fight him with care and focus on defense. Tie
him down. The Envoy will reinforce you right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired,
red-eyed Infinity Fiendgod had close to the power of a elite
Daofather as well. In the previous battles, two of them combined were
able to resist the power of True Immortal Jimin’s Pangu God, which
was a testament to their great power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daomother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six-armed Rahu-Ning
and the white-haired, re-eyed Infinity Fiendgod were both in front of
their respective armies. They charged towards each other, and as they
closed in, the Darknorth sword in Ning’s hand moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange, unfathomable
streak of sword-light suddenly flickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-haired head
went flying into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
unpredictable, the most unfathomable sword-stance Ning had…the
Shadowless stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired
Infinity Fiendgod’s head went flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The headless body
instantly began to break repart, revealing the many Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals that had been inside of it in the Infinity Fiendgod
Formation. These Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were completely
terrified. They didn’t even think of fighting back. All of them
fled every which way, seeking to move as far as they could from the
terrifying Rahu-Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooooosh. Streaks
of sword-light flashed out with the power of a vortex, transforming
into six gigantic black holes that devoured all of the Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Soleheart stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a stance meant
for defense, but Ji Ning was far, far more powerful than his
opponents right now. The difference in power was so great the
vortexes created by the Soleheart stance had the power to break apart
his foes, and so this technique that was meant for continuous defense
was actually converted into a tool of slaughter. It was a terrifying
killer move, as these ordinary Empyrean Gods and True Immortals,
compared to Ning, were simply far too weak. They were all swept into
the black holes, and the ablative, swirling power that was meant to
weaken enemy attacks were instead used to effortlessly grind them to
dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be
happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be so
strong?!” The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were gripped by
despair. They did their utmost, but remained unable to break free and
escape from the terrifying black holes. They were all drawn inside,
and all were ground apart and slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In but an instant, more
than five hundred Empyrean Gods and True Immortals perished! Not one
was spared!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene caused the
face of Daomother Devilhand, who was watching on the walls of the
Seamless Citadel, to turn absolutely bone-white. The black-robed
Godking’s entire body was trembling slightly as well. It must be
understood that the sudden appearance of the Envoy of All Things on
the field of battle had only caused roughly five hundred casualties
amongst the ranks of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, Ji
Ning’s sudden explosion of power had resulted in the destruction of
a Seamless Infinity Formation and an Infinity Fiendgod formation. The
number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals he had slain already
exceeded seven hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is his sword
that bizarre and that powerful?” The black-robed Godking shook his
head, unable to accept what he was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance
had always been the most unpredictable sword-stance Ning had. After
spending centuries learning the many terrifying sword-arts left
behind by World God Northrest, Ning had distilled their essence and
infused it into his own [Brightmoon] sword-art, causing the
Shadowless stance to become even more bizarre. If a sword-attack was
both unpredictable and ridiculously fast, it would become terrifying
to fight against. In fact, if it was sufficiently fast, it could be
completely unblockable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what had
happened to the Infinity Fiendgod. It had been completely unable to
block against this sword-stance! A single blow had severed its head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I wouldn’t be
able to block that sword at all.” The black-robed Godking’s heart
was quaking. Previously, Ning had displayed the terrifyingly fast and
penetrating Blood Drop stance, but at least it wasn’t
unpredictable; it was a sword that was straight and aboveboard. The
Godking felt that he should at least be able to block it. But the
Shadowless stance…even he didn’t feel any confidence in being
able to block it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had actually
caused him, the exalted, nominal leader of the Seamless Gate…to
feel a faint sense of fear?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly didn’t want
to believe this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he be this
powerful? It makes no sense. This simply isn’t possible at all.”
The black-robed Godking shook his head. Prior to this, he had held Ji
Ning in no regard at all. How could a single weak Empyrean God have
an impact on the overall situation? But now, this Empyrean God had
unleashed the power of a elite Daofather. “Although Ji Ning’s
sword-art is formidable, judging from the light surrounding his
sword, he should have only reached the fourth stage of swordforce.
The reason why Houyi was so formidable was because he, as an Empyrean
God, broke through to reach the fifth stage of heartforce. That was
why he had such terrifying power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s
swordforce is only at the fourth stage. It makes no sense for him to
be so powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes no sense…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
felt a mixture of urgency and anger. No matter what the result of
this battle was…the painful losses they had just suffered was
enough to cause his heart to feel as though it was being roasted by
flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
simply couldn’t accept this…but the countless Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Nuwa Alliance who saw this all felt their blood boil
with excitement. Some of the Seven Planets Gods actually let out
excited, heroic roars! The last fight had been a miserable one, but
this time Ji Ning showed far, far too much power! In the past, Ji
Ning had been able to use the Rahu God to force the Seamless Gate to
bow its head, but back then he had barely been at the Daofather level
of power. He was probably a bit weaker than even a Seamless Infinity
Formation! But now, he was able to slay with a single-sword strike an
Infinity Fiendgod that was close to a elite Daofather in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.” Xuan
Yuan exclaimed with surprise, “Compared to the incredibly fast
sword-strike he used at first, the strike he used to slay the
Infinity Fiendgod was even more dazzling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange and
unfathomable. The profound mysteries within his sword-art have
already reached the apex. Without question, this is the number-one
sword-art of the Three Realms.” Fuxi smiled as he spoke out in
praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly is
formidable.” Lord Tathagata the Buddha revealed a smile as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can win this
war.” Daoist Three Purities was laughing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the seven
major powers all begin to laugh and smile in a joyful way. From Ning
using a single sword-strike to slay an Infinity Fiendgod that was
close to a elite Daofather in power, they were able to tell that he
definitely had the power to stalemate the Envoy of All Things. Given
how many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals he had slain, their side
definitely held the upper hand once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti, it seems
you underestimated your disciple.” Suiren glanced at the nearby
Subhuti, who was smiling as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.
Wonderful. You didn’t let your hatred blind you. Although you were
filled with rage and the desire to kill, you were able to remain
calm.” Subhuti casually said a few words of praise for his
disciple. In truth, he was the happiest of the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop putting on a
show of being calm. All I have to do is look at your twitching beard
and I can tell how happy you are right now,” Shennong teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, can’t I be
happy?” Subhuti stroked his beard and smiled. “If you have a
problem with it, go and produce a similarly talented disciple of your
own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough with the
chit-chat. Look, the Envoy has charged out, and Ning’s charging
towards it as well,” Suiren said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven major powers
began to watch closely once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning had dealt
with the Infinity Fiendgod, he had charged straight towards the army
of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The Rahu-Ning’s
footsteps were simply too fast, causing Daomother Devilhand, atop the
distant city walls of the Seamless Citadel, to begin to worry.
Although she was extremely skilled in commanding armies, there was no
solution she could use in the face of such an absolutely superiority
in speed and power. Even if she had her army immediately flee, there
was no way that it would be able to escape from Ji Ning, given how
quickly he ran.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for blocking him?
Even the Infinity Fiendgod, which had close to the power of a elite
Daofather, had been slain in one blow, while the incredibly tough and
resilient Seamless Infinity Formation had also been pierced through
with one strike. No matter how many reinforcements she sent, they
would simply be going to their deaths. Ji Ning was about to reach
their army. Once he made it in, it would be an utter slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Envoy, stop Ji
Ning.” Daomother Devilhand immediately gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of the
army, begin to withdraw.” Daomother Devilhand gave yet another
order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their side had
yet to be completely defeated, the situation on the battlefield was
quite apparent. Ji Ning was probably strong enough to withstand the
Envoy. No matter what, retreating for now was the best option. If
they let their army fight without being confident that they would
win, it would be akin to sending them into a massacre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a long period of
time had passed between Ning’s two clashes, resulting in both
armies now being quite close to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!” The
Envoy bellowed as it charged straight towards Ning, who moved to
intercept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was an
ape-shaped Envoy of All Things, wreathed in dark-red flames. It had
been invented by an alien Outsider, the Lord of All Things, and
Grandmaster Blackheaven had been responsible for forging it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was a
Fiendgod that had been created based on the alien Outsider, Rahu, who
had been used as the template.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
filled with unearthly amounts of power. They were evenly matched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed in
an unpredictable, unfathomable manner, causing the heart of Empyrean
God Bloodwave, the controller of the Envoy, to quiver. It was too
bizarre and too fast! He hurriedly moved to block. The Envoy of All
Things possessed absolutely astonishing power, and if a Daofather was
in command of it, it would be able to unleash even greater levels of
power. Three to five of them joining together would be a match for an
overlord-level Daofather, like the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism.
However, the current controller was ‘merely’ Empyrean God
Bloodwave, and there was a limit to how strong an Empyrean God could
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous explosion
rang out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy stumbled two
steps back before steadying itself…and then a hint of a smile
appeared on its face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really am a fool.
I was scared silly by that terrifying sword-blow of his.” Empyrean
God Bloodwave regained his composure. “His sword-arts are the most
terrifying sword-arts I have ever seen…but so what? Not even the
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism would be able to damage the Envoy in
the slightest. Ji Ning can’t hurt me at all. There’s no need for
me to even defend against his sword-arts; all I need to do is
continuously attach. If I can manage to grab him, I’ll be able to
tear that Rahu God body of his apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy pounced
forward in a savage manner, striking out with twin claws at lightning
speed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flew
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
were completely superior to his foe’s techniques. Sword-arts that
surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos…there was no way his foe
could block his attacks. In an instant, Ning unleashed more than a
hundred ‘Shadowless’ strikes, hacking down repeatedly upon his
foe, but he wasn’t even able to leave a tiny mark on the golem.
Ning actually had to be more careful than before, as his own body was
simply formed from the energy of Heaven and Earth. Once it was
damaged, it would completely break apart. Fortunately, Ning’s
sword-arts were at such a high level that he was able to completely
block every single strike of the Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder the Envoy
of All Things had such a fearsome reputation during the war that
ended the Primordial Era. If a Daofather was in command, even I
probably wouldn’t be able to withstand it. Fortunately, the one
before me is merely commanded by an Empyrean God,” Ning mused to
himself.

Chapter 18 - Stay Your Hand Immediately!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning exchanged
blows with the Envoy, the situation for the Seamless Gate’s forces
on the battlefield had turned very grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that
Ning had slain the Infinity Fiendgod, the military genius Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan had immediately given an order: “Jimin, Wood
Child, launch an all-out attack.” At the same time, Daomother
Devilhand had commanded her troops, “All forces, withdraw!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, both of the
commanders were able to see how the situation on the battlefield had
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu-Jimin
instantly exploded with speed, throwing the rest of the army far, far
behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, next
to the Pangu-Jimin yet another Pangu God emerged. This one had a face
that was quite young and fresh; it was Wood Child, the commander of
the second Pangu Genesis Formation! Clearly, the Seamless Gate’s
suspicions had been correct; Xuan Yuan and the others had been able
to come up with no other ideas at all, and so were planning on
compensating by increasing their total forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been preparing
to use two Pangu Gods, having them join forces to fight against the
Envoy of All Things. Wood Child was one of the five mighty Children
that had once accompanied Mother Nuwa herself. The Pangu God he
commanded was currently wielding the ‘Godsteel Staff of Aeons’,
and it ran alongside the Jimin-Pangu at the same level of speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Pangu Gods
quickly charged into the Seamless Gate’s army. They were like
tigers let loose amongst a flock of sheep. Most likely, the only
thing within the Seamless Gate’s army that could match them for
speed was the Envoy, with all the other formations and golems,
including even the Infinity Fiendgods, being no match for them at
all. What’s more, the Seamless Gate’s army had been greatly
weakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their most powerful
asset, the Envoy of All Things, had been tied down by Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was only one
Infinity Fiendgod left! It must be understood that it had previously
taken two of them to just barely be a match for a single Pangu God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even one of the
Seamless Infinity Formations had been destroyed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two Pangu Gods
could just barely be considered elite Daofathers. Naturally, they
absolutely dominated and devastated their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Daomother
Devilhand ground her teeth upon seeing this. She hurriedly deployed
golems and formations to try and tie down those two Pangu Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Pangu Gods were
simply far too powerful. If the many formations and golems on their
side joined forces, they’d be able to tie down the Pangu Gods for a
time…but as more time passed, the rest of the Nuwa Alliance’s
army would arrive as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all because
of that Darknorth.” Daomother Devilhand looked at the distant,
battling forms of the Envoy and the Rahu-Ning. “He’s completely
tied down the Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are we to do?!”
The black-robed Godking was even more frantic than her. For even
Daomother Devilhand, who loved a good fight, to become panicked…the
Godking felt as though this entire battlefield was crumbling before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
black-robed Godking stared at the distant Rahu-Ning. “Ji Ning is
the cause of all of this. He’s wrecked our battle lines and has
even tied down the Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning fought against
the Envoy, there was no one at all from either army who dared to
approach the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their arena was the
most terrifying region in this entire battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. The Envoy does
have some weaknesses.” As Ning fought, he also kept a careful eye
on his opponent, searching for an opening that would allow him to
seize victory. “Although the Envoy’s body is quite tough, as it
is a golem, the person who commands it…well, that person is merely
an Empyrean God and True Immortal. Thus, the attack speed and
techniques used are comparatively low-level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a peerless
Sword Immortal, after all. He was a master of technique, and his
sword-art had been proclaimed by Fuxi, Suiren, and the others as the
number one sword-art of the entire Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his eyes, the
close-combat techniques being used by the Envoy golem were indeed
quite ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The weakness of the
Envoy lies with the Empyrean God controlling it. If I want to deal
with it…I’ll need to put my techniques on full display.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As their battle
continued, multiple battle strategies quickly flashed through Ning’s
mind. Any battle would entail using your strengths to attack the
enemy’s weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! Stay your
hand immediately!” The black-robed Godking sent mentally to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking?” Ning’s
gaze turned towards the black-robed Godking standing atop the distant
walls of the Seamless Citadel. Their gazes met…and Ning just smiled
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you continue like
this, I’ll immediately kill your senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei
and shatter her soul. In fact, I’ll even destroy her truesoul.”
The black-robed Godking’s mental voice was furious. Destroying a
truesoul was extremely difficult, but a Daofather was indeed capable
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Envoy
battling against Ji Ning could sense that Ji Ning’s killing intent
had suddenly skyrocketed for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that this is
a battlefield, and that you are a member of the Nuwa Alliance.
There’s no way you can just give up the fight, as those major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance would definitely blame you. All I want
you to do is to keep fighting for a while, then reveal an opening and
allow the Envoy to injure you, forcing you to ‘unwillingly’ quit
the battlefield,” the black-robed Godking sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Have Ning reveal an
opening?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Intentionally allow the
Envoy to wound him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was no easy task.
If he wasn’t careful, the Rahu Formation might completely crumble..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-art
vastly surpasses his in technique. You’ll definitely be able to
control the degree to which he injures you.” The black-robed
Godking sent mentally, “Hurry up. I want you to it right now. I
don’t care what method you use, I want you to immediately leave
this field of battle. Otherwise, Yu Wei will die immediately! Her
soul will be shattered and her truesoul extinguished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…really are
quite shameless.” For the first time, Ning replied to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shameless? For the
sake of achieving victory, I don’t care if I’m forced to act in
such a way. I walk the path of the demonheart to begin with. I’m a
demon, Ji Ning. Your side already has a huge advantage in this battle
because of you, and you’ve already slaughtered enough of our
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. You should be satisfied. So long as
you retreat, I’ll immediately return your senior apprentice-sister
to you. I absolutely guarantee that I’ll give her to you. But you
need to leave this battlefield. Right now!” The black-robed Godking
frantically urged him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every moment that was
being wasted, the two Pangu Gods were massacring more and more
members of the Seamless Gate. Although many formations and golems
were being used to tie them down, the great army of the Nuwa Alliance
was drawing closer and closer. Without the assistance of the Envoy of
All Things, their losses would be utterly devastating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick. Quick!
Quick!!” The Godking was frantic. He watched with nervousness and
eagerness from atop the walls of the Seamless Citadel. He was like a
terminally ill man who, in his desperation, would consult with any
doctor who claimed to have a cure. He knew that after he had toyed
with Ji Ning last time, the chances of Ji Ning trusting him a second
time were virtually nil. However…the Godking truly had no other
options left to him. In addition, he could sense that Ji Ning truly
did have extremely deep feelings for Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one’s truesoul
was extinguished, there would no longer even be a way for one to
recover it from the River of Destiny. He believed that Ji Ning
absolutely would not be willing to allow Yu Wei’s truesoul to be
extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s moving.”
The black-robed Godking’s eyes lit up. The distant Ji Ning had
suddenly exploded with power, his six arms wielding six divine swords
in a wild, frenetic assault upon the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy had just a
set of two claws, while Ning had six arms. Ning’s sword-arts were
far too terrifying, and so for a time the Envoy was covered,
surrounded, and completely suppressed by countless sword-shadows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have his attacks
only grown more berserk?” At first, the Godking was angered, but he
then turned calm, as though he had thought of something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning really
is clever.” The Godking’s eyes lit up again. “He’s using his
six arms to furiously attack, which means his defense is naturally
weaker now. No matter how powerful his attacks are, there is no way
he can wound the Envoy…but his lowered defense means that there is
a chance that the Envoy might wound him. So long as he is wounded, Ji
Ning would naturally have an excuse to quit the field of battle. He
would be able to excuse his failure to the rest of the Nuwa Alliance
as caused by his desire to gain a quick victory, which was why the
Envoy had a chance to wound him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is
clever.” The black-robed Godking waited eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…his attacks
are a bit too berserk. He’s completely suppressed the Envoy. Even
the Envoy’s attacks are being shut down.” The Godking frowned,
then immediately sent another mental message. “Ji Ning, you have to
give the Envoy a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sudden boom could be
heard from the Envoy of All Things, which had been completely
surrounded and bombarded by those countless sword-shadows. Ning was
wielding six Darknorth swords, and the one that had reached the Chaos
treasure level had just unleashed a sword-stance that was filled with
seemingly infinite power. This could be described as the most fierce
and most dominating attack he possessed, and it was the stance that
he had origally used to send those two violet-light golems flying far
backwards, past the entire army of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An incomparably savage
stroke. The sword smashed down upon the back of the right knee of the
Envoy. Its power was like that of the divine axe which Pangu had used
to cleave apart Heaven from Earth. A thunderous boom could be heard
as the Envoy was knocked off balance and fell to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To knock down the Envoy
was actually extremely difficult, because its two legs were extremely
powerful and stable. Even if it was knocked flying, it would be very
hard to make it actually fall down onto the ground. Experts at this
level of skill all were extremely good at keeping their balance and
remaining stable. To cause someone to lose his balance was far, far
too hard. The many sword-strikes which Ning had blanketed the Envoy
in seemed useless, but in truth they were meant to keep the Envoy off
its balance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on his
absolute advantage in technique, he had managed to destabilize the
Envoy…and then he had sent the Heavenbreaker stance to smash at the
back of the knee. And with a boom! The Envoy had fallen to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” The Envoy’s
controller began to panic…but what greeted his protestation was a
fierce, sharp streak of sword-light that smashed away at the Envoy’s
twin claws, giving them no chance to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh! Four of the
six arms of the Rahu-Ning were currently wielding swords. The other
two arms were holding onto a rope that glowed with black light. The
rope quickly wrapped itself around the Envoy’s body. The Envoy had
been knocked to the ground and its arms had been completely
suppressed by Ning’s nonstop attacks. The rope instantly and
completely wrapped itself in circles around the Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any golem, no matter
powerful, would be able to do nothing once it had been completely
bound. Although the Envoy roared furiously and tried to struggle, it
still wasn’t able to break free from the Protocosmic spirit-rope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone across the
entire battlefield turned silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the two battling
Pangu Gods. Even the seven smiling major powers of the Nuwa Alliance.
Even the panicking black-robed Godking. Even the ashen-faced
Daomother Devilhand. All of them fell silent. All of them were
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They just stared
blankly at what had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy of All
Things…had been tightly bound by a Protocosmic spirit-rope. It was
like a zongzi 1 that had fallen to the ground. It was completely
unable to break free whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning raised
his head, staring towards the Seamless Citadel. Staring towards the
black-robed Godking standing atop the citadel walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” The
black-robed Godking was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand was
rather dazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Immortals and
Fiendgods on the entire battlefield were dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the seven major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance were dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Captured?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy of All
Things…had been captured?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an incredibly
valuable and precious military asset. If a Daofather was in command
of it, it would instantly possess utterly earth-shaking levels of
power. The Seamless Gate had paid an incalculably vast price to
create each of the Envoys. The only reason they had even sent one of
them to take part in this Realmwar was because this one was an
incredibly important one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An azure-skinned gourd
suddenly appeared in the Rahu-Ning’s hands. The stopper was pulled
open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently murmured
these words…and with a whoosh, the tightly bound Envoy that lay on
the ground was transformed to a tiny size, then sucked straight into
the mouth of the gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently plugged the
gourd with the stopper once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. This is a type of
Chinese sticky rice cake that is usually wrapped up in banana leaves,
then tied with string.  ↩

Chapter 19 - Defeated in Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the peak of a
solitary mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed,
azure-haired Lord of All Fiends was seated in the lotus position. He
stared through the infinite Void, his gaze focused on the battle that
was occurring within the Deerchaser major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The Lord
of All Fiends murmured softly to himself. For the first time, he paid
close attention to this minor figure who he had never cared about
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This critical
battle…has been lost. We even lost an Envoy of All Things.” The
Lord of All Fiends shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a figure
appeared next to his side. It was Grandmaster Blackheaven, and he had
an absolutely frantic look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,”
Blackheaven said frantically, “We have to take the Envoy back! We
spend enormous amounts of effort to create them, and now one of them
has been stolen! We now have one less, while the Nuwa Alliance has
one more. This is going to have a huge impact on the war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it back…how?”
The Lord of All Fiends stared at Blackheaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
take it back. We lost it in battle during a Realmwar…and everyone
in the Three Realms is watching this battle. All of the major powers,
on our side or in the Nuwa Alliance, are watching this battle. If I
make a move, most likely all of the other major powers will make a
move as well. There’s no way the Nuwa Alliance will give us any
chance whatsoever.” The Lord of All Fiends was quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but…”
Blackheaven was absolutely besides himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we lost, we
lost…and we should admit that they won cleanly.” The Lord of All
Fiends shook his head. “During the Primordial Era, the Nuwa
Alliance was able to produce Houyi. Now, it has given birth to
Darknorth. This is destiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t the
Godking have the soul of Ji Ning’s Dao-companion, Yu Wei? Can’t
we use it to trade with Ji Ning for the Envoy?” Blackheaven
immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” The
Lord of All Fiends shook his head. “The ownership of the Envoy is
something that has a significant impact on the war as a whole. It
isn’t something which Ji Ning can decide on his own. Even if Ji
Ning was willing to give it to us, his master Subhuti, Suiren,
Shennong, Daoist Three Purities, and the rest absolutely would not
permit it. The loss and gain of an Envoy of All Things is something
of enormous impact.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
Blackheaven nodded helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to admit it. All
personal feelings and emotions would have to be discarded when the
stakes impacted one side’s chances of winning the war. There really
was no way the Nuwa Alliance would permit Ji Ning to give it up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend…”
Suddenly, a dreamy, ghostly voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mist around him
began to coalesce, slowly forming into a human-shaped figure that was
dressed in a simple gray robe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You remain as
distant and detached as always.” The gray-robed figure’s voice
was insubstantial and ephemeral. “Fighting a war…the key lies in
the word ‘fight’. Fight for every scrap of opportunity. Only then
will you have a chance to be the final victor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
stared at the figure before him…at the king who had once unified
the entire Seamless Chaosworld. The one who had been a match for
Mother Nuwa in power, and who had only been just one step away from
becoming a World God himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long time no
see…Demonheart,” the Lord of All Fiends said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning took out the
gourd and sucked away the Envoy of All Things, the entire battlefield
became deathly still. The Seamless Gate’s forces no longer had any
desire to fight whatsoever!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost.”
Daomother Devilhand had a look of regret in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened? How could…this Ji Ning…” The black-robed Godking
ground his teeth. “This was the critical battle…and we actually
lost it because of Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
truly couldn’t accept this outcome. He was the one to plan out all
the wars, and he was also the titular head of the entire Seamless
Gate! Ji Ning was nothing more than a pawn that he had never truly
cared about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw
immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t try to keep
fighting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
immediately sent mental orders to all of her forces, ordering the
remnants of her army to immediately retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outcome of this
battle had clearly been determined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy of All Things
had been captured by Ji Ning. Even if Ji Ning no longer participated
in this battle, those two Pangu Gods alone, when reinforced by the
great army of the Nuwa Alliance, would be powerful enough to utterly
decimate the surviving soldiers of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost.” The
black-robed Godking closed his eyes, murmuring to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, he opened his
eyes. His eyes were as cold as ice as he stared downwards at the
Rahu-Ning…and Ji Ning just so happened to be staring back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-robed Godking let out a cold laugh, then waved his hand,
causing a semi-translucent figure appeared within it. It was Yu Wei’s
soul. The black-robed maiden, Yu Wei, stared at her surroundings in
puzzlement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body trembled.
He stared blankly at the semi-translucent figure atop the walls of
the Seamless Citadel. This was the person he had been thinking about,
day and night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” The towering, valiant Fiendgod just stood
there, murmuring to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei saw Ning as
well. She opened her mouth to speak towards him, and although no
sounds came out, Ning was able to read her lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Junior
apprentice-brother. Yu Wei was looking at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you that if
you disobeyed me, I would kill her. I told you that I would shatter
her soul and extinguish her truesoul.” The black-robed Godking
clenched his enormous hand around the semi-translucent Yu Wei, and
his voice echoed within the heavens. “Didn’t you say…that she’s
already dead, and that you killed her? Haha…then, let me let her
truly die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched his hand
out, as though he was about to say something…but the black-robed
Godking tightly clenched his fist. As he did so, the semi-translucent
shadow of Yu Wei stared at Ning, her lips moving one final time. Take
care of…Brightmoon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her soul vanished…and
her truesoul flickered with one final gleam of light before it too
was disintegrated, melting away into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
blankly, his hand outstretched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heart-rending pain
instantly filled his entire body. It was as though an endless wave
had instantly swallowed him, drowning him within its tide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was dead. She was
truly dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve hidden your
daughter quite well. You keep her within the Crescent major world. If
she was in any other place, I would’ve killed your daughter as
well. Ahaha…it seems that I am destined to forever be the demon
that lurks in your heart, the demon that haunts your nightmares.
Ahahaha…our war has just begun! Are you truly prepared for it? Your
daughter will die in the future as well. She’ll also die…ahahaha…”
The black-robed Godking cackled with utter madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
not moving at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The army of the Nuwa
Alliance pursued their foes, but everyone was also paying attention
to Ning. He stood there, surrounded by an aura of power that seemed
to fill the entirety of the heavens…and yet, he also seemed to have
become a bit fragile and frail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Nuwa Alliance’s citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti, Shennong, Xuan
Yuan, and the rest of the seven major powers all had ugly looks on
their faces as they witnessed this. However…there was nothing they
could do. Even if they did try to intervene, there was no way for
them to rescue Yu Wei, because Yu Wei’s fragile, weak soul had been
effortlessly wiped out by the Godking in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Subhuti
turned his head, staring towards the other, black-robed Ning who
stood behind him. He said softly, “This is war. On the field of
battle, many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, many disciples of True
Gods and Daofathers, many family members and loved ones, will perish.
And this is just the start. In the future…if our side loses the
war, all of us ‘major powers’ will be wiped out, to say nothing
of the rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the nature
of war.” Xuan Yuan spoke in a consoling voice as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing else
they could say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This truly was the
nature of war. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Blood for
blood. Neither side would show any mercy or care about their former
friendships; they would use any tools they could to weaken their
foes. Ji Ning deeply cared about love, and so to shatter Yu Wei’s
soul and destroy her truesoul was an act that would forever plant a
thorn into his heart. It was entirely possible that in the future,
the thorn would result in a devastating, breathtaking outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
just stood there, his eyes bloodshot. Tears flowed down his face from
his bloodshot eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” The
black-robed Ning raised his head and laughed loudly, the tears in his
eyes instantly vanishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” The
distant, towering figure of the Rahu-Ning also raised his head to
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His laughter shook the
heavens. His laughter caused the earth to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His laughter caused
one’s heart to freeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone could hear the
agony and the frenzied hatred contained within his laughter…the
limitless, infinite amount of hate. But the black-robed Godking,
standing atop the distant walls of the Seamless Citadel, didn’t
care at all. He just smield coldly. “The more you hate, the better.
The more you hate, the more it will affect your Dao-heart…and if
the effect is strong enough, it’ll make it hard for you to make any
more breakthroughs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The laughter continued
to ring out…and then it suddenly stopped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning lowered
his head. He clenched the swords in his hands, then murmured to
himself in a low voice. “Senior apprentice-sister…I’m sorry.
Brightmoon…I’ll take care of her…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning raised
his head to stare at the walls of the Seamless Citadel and the
Godking. He murmured to himself, “And that Godking…I’ll kill
him personally and sacrifice his soul to you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every member of the
Nuwa Alliance on the battlefield, especially the Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals who were close to Ning and viewed him as a brother,
was staring at him with worry. Subhuti was staring at him with worry
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning’s
laughter had come to a halt…and then, he moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!!!” A black
serpent of lightning suddenly flashed, streaking towards the fleeing
army of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
forces had been engaged in a tactical retreat, staving off the two
Pangu Gods while continuing to flee. And now…a black lightning
serpent had suddenly entered their midst.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood sprayed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortals and Fiendgods
died in countless numbers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! His Rahu God
can also use the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique?”
The black-robed Godking’s face completely changed. To be able to
use the Rahu God in performing the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
technique meant that Ji Ning was in complete control of the Rahu
God’s power, not allowing any of it at all to leak out. This meant
that Ji Ning was able to control all of the Rahu God’s potential
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand’s
face changed as well, and she immediately issued a frantic mental
order. “Retreat at will!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Retreat at will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What this meant was…no
need to worry about anything else or about others. Everyone was to
flee for their own lives, using any methods and means available to
them. There was no need to cooperate, no need to work with others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way at all
that they would be able to sustain an organized retreat in the face
of Rahu-Ning, who was massacring them at light-speed with his
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique.

Chapter 20 - The Curtain Falls
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Flee,
quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Separate and flee in
different directions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daomother Devilhand
gave the order, the entire army of the Seamless Gate completely broke
apart into countless individual figures. Even the Infinity God, the
Seamless Infinity Formations, and the ‘Life and Death Formations of
the Twin Realm Calamity Dragons’ all voluntarily dispersed into
their component individuals. The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
drew the other Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals into their
personal estate-treasures, then frantically began to flee in every
possible direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
was filled with countless dense clusters of Immortals and Fiendgods.
There were far, far too many fleeing Immortals and Fiendgods, and so
the Nuwa Alliance didn’t dare to voluntarily disperse their own
formations as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…the damnable
Seamless Gate has been utterly terrified. Feiyou, let’s have a
little competition and see which of us can kill more Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, let’s!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Seven Planets
Gods charged in every direction, and they slaughtered all who stood
before them. As for the distant Myriad Immortals Armageddon
Formations, they began to launch a constant stream of long-distance
attacks. They originally had been meant to play a supporting role on
the battlefield, but when used against Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals, they were veritable engines of slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single blow from
them had the power of a Daofather, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Bang! The entire
battlefield was filled with the sound of explosions. The army of the
Nuwa Alliance began a frenzied massacre, going all out to kill as
many as they could. The more they killed today, the fewer they would
face in the future, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And without question,
the most terrifying figure on this field of question was the
Rahu-Ning, who moved about in the form of a black serpent of
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning’s sword
had expanded to become more than three million meters long. His six
massive swords swept outwards in every direction, and every single
region he passed through resulted in an utter wipeout of the enemy
forces there, causing utter terror to race through the hearts of the
Seamless Gate’s soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Darknorth,
your Dao-companion is sharing the same death-site as us. Worth it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, we’ll
embark on the next step of our journey…and you won’t live for
much longer either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slaughtered
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals all cursed furiously as they were
slaughtered. The Rahu-Ning, however, just killed them in icy cold
silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t feel much
hatred towards these ordinary Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the
Seamless Gate. However…this was war, and they were on the wrong
side. If he didn’t wipe them out, they would wipe out the Nuwa
Alliance. There were no other choices for him to choose! If he wanted
more people on his side to live, his only option was to kill as many
as he could, to massacre as many as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the army of the
Seamless Gate had completely split apart into its component soldiers,
there were so many of them on the battlefield that invariably some of
them were able to escape and reach the Seamless Citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Seamless Citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
and Daomother Devilhand both had ugly looks on their faces as they
watched a few Empyrean Gods and True Immortals flee into the citadel,
the vast majority of the others being slaughtered in the desolate
wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Disastrous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This defeat was utterly
disastrous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an utter
massacre!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Envoy had
appeared for the first time, its attacks had caused Xuan Yuan to
order his army to retreat as well, but it was still an orderly,
organized retreat. But this time, the Seamless Gate’s entire army
had completely collapsed, forcing Daomother Devilhand to issue an
order for them to retreat at will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all because
of Ji Ning,” Daomother Devilhand said hoarsely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Ji Ning who had
instantly shattered the Seamless Infinity Formation, slain an
Infinity God, and then captured the Seamless Gate’s ‘killer
weapon’, the Envoy of All Things. And then, the Rahu-Ning had
actually been able to use the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique
while in Rahu form. Given the power of this technique, the speed at
which he pursued and killed his foes was simply too terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
black-robed Godking’s eyes flashed with cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time seemed to flow as
slowly as sand in an hourglass, one grain falling down at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Large numbers of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were massacred on the battlefield,
with only the occasional fleeing straggler making it back into the
Seamless Citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, finally…the
battlefield turned quiet once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were no longer
any surviving Empyrean Gods or True Immortals of the Seamless Gate on
the battlefield at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below the walls of the
Seamless Citadel, the towering, bloodlusted Rahu-Ning stared upwards
towards the black-robed Godking. His eyes were filled with a
bone-chilling murderous intent. Ji Ning truly wanted to attack the
Seamless Citadel and battle the Godking…but he saw that Daomother
Devilhand was next to the Godking’s side. Daomother Devilhand was a
terrifying figure who had actually been able to battle Mother Nuwa
herself for a period of time during the war that ended the Primordial
Era. If he truly was to attack, Daomother Devilhand would probably
have enough of an excuse to attack and most likely kill him with a
single palm blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still didn’t have
enough power to fight against the most truly supreme figures of the
Three Realms yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Citadel were filled with agony and rage…but the Nuwa
Alliance’s castle was filled with the sound of rejoicing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven major powers
atop the walls were all laughing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won.” For once,
Daoist Three Purities had a broad smile on his face as he stroked his
beard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Darknorth said
to give him a month, he really did have the power to back up what he
said. He wasn’t just spouting rubbish.” Lord Tathagata the Buddha
chortled, “He was actually able to unleash such astounding power
through the Rahu Formation. I saw that he was able to command his
Rahu God while using the [Ninehorn Lightning Formation]. It seems
that he must have mastered all of its power, preventing any of it
from leaking outwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Fuxi nodded,
then chuckled curiously. “I really wonder how Ji Ning accomplished
it. Perhaps it really does have something to do with Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake?”
Lord Tathagata nodded as well. “After Jueming returned from
Undermoon Lake, he’s been almost perpetually in secluded, solitary
meditation. He rarely comes out, but is so powerful that even I am
uncertain of his true strength. Like him, Ji Ning left from Undermoon
Lake under his own power. He must have gained some special rewards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Must be it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers
chatted amongst themselves for a time. Undermoon Lake was quite a
mysterious place in their heart, and they had once tried everything
they could to enter, only to fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the black-robed
Ning was next to them, not too far away, he was able to clearly hear
the conversation going on amongst the major powers. In fact, some of
the major powers actually sneaked peeks at Ning’s face. Clearly,
however, Ji Ning was not in the mood to discuss anything. He was
finding it extremely difficult to recover from the state of frenzied
agony and rage that he had fallen into upon Yu Wei’s death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw our
troops.” Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.”
Daomother Devilhand’s face was rather pallid and wan. This was the
first time in her life that she had suffered such a disastrous
defeat. “More than two thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals…in
the end, less than two hundred survived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
was silent for a long moment. He then couldn’t help but ask,
“Aunt-master, how could Ji Ning be this powerful? I simply don’t
understand. Is it possible that he’s actually already a Daofather,
but has been keeping his aura hidden and thus has been pretending to
be an Empyrean God? If he is a Daofather, he shouldn’t even be
allowed to take part in the war for karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he’s a
Daofather, he would have to have already mastered a Heavenly Dao.”
Daomother Devilhand said softly, “But I saw quite clearly that
although Darknorth’s sword-arts were incomparably transcendent,
perhaps the best in all the Three Realms, that was simply because he
has trained in and mastered the [Five Treasures]. His sword can
surpass the limits of the Heavenly Daos, and he’s reached a
wondrous level of technique, which is why he is so powerful. However,
I can’t find any traces of the Heavenly Daos in his sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His movement
techniques, his combat methods…I can find no trace of the mysteries
of the Heavenly Daos in them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he truly had
gained insight into a Heavenly Dao, then Demonheart definitely
would’ve found out. He is part of the Heavenly Daos, after all.”
Daomother Devilhand looked towards the Godking. “Demonheart is your
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
was stunned. Slowly, reluctantly, he nodded his head. It was true. If
Ji Ning had mastered a Heavenly Dao and caused a resonance with the
Heavenly Daos, how could it have escaped the notice of the Lord of
the Demonheart?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then is it possible
that he became a True God?” The black-robed Godking couldn’t help
but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
frowned as she glanced at the black-robed Godking. “The Rahu
Formation uses Immortal energy to control countless Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals, using their power to summon and
control the vast nature energy of Heaven and Earth. Even if he was a
True God, if all he had was his powerful divine power, it would be
useless in the formation. Not even a True God would be capable of
unleashing such power from the Rahu Formation. Don’t you even
understand something as basic as this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rebuked, the
black-robed Godking lowered his head. He just couldn’t accept this.
He really couldn’t.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pawn that he had held
in no regard had ended up ruining their entire plan for the war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” The black-robed Godking said, “The Envoy has been seized. Ji
Ning has a true body and a Primaltwin; he can have his true body
command the Rahu Formation while having his Primaltwin command the
Envoy. If his terrifying sword-arts are paired up with the power of
an Envoy, the power of his Primaltwin in the Envoy would probably be
comparable to yet another Rahu God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s guess
was wrong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t know that
in truth. Ji Ning had the Immortal energy of a Daofather. If he was
to use his Daofather-level energy to command an Envoy of All Things
and use it to unleash his terrifying sword-arts…he would be able to
unleash the full power of the Envoy, a level of power comparable to
that of the Envoys under the control of the Lord of All Things all
those years ago. Those Envoys were close to the overlord-level, and
if three to five of them joined forces, they were absolutely a match
for the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning’s
energy and sword-arts were all at a high enough level for him to
command the Envoy effectively, allowing it to unleash a level of
power close to that of the overlord-level Daofathers! His power would
vastly outstrip the power of a Rahu God; he would essentially be
equal in power to figures like Subhuti and Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A true body and a
Primaltwin…” Daomother Devilhand frowned as well. “Troublesome.
Very troublesome. Very well…we need to go back and think on how we
are going to deal with this new issue. Ask your master and the others
to ponder on this as well. What should we do with this Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, the Nuwa
Alliance had a headache over the question of how to deal with the
Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, it was the
Seamless Gate’s turn to have a headache, this one over Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is now time for
us to leave the Deerchaser world,” Daomother Devilhand said in a
low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This war had been lost.
It was time to leave.

Chapter 21 - Secret Discussions
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Critical wars like this
would generally continue for many years before ending, but an
unexpected variable had appeared in the form of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, both sides
essentially knew what the other had up their sleeves. The Nuwa
Alliance knew that their foes had an Envoy of All Things, and so they
were still prepared to continue battling against it. At most, they
would be at a disadvantage and the war would become difficult to win.
However, Ning’s sudden appearance out of nowhere had caught the
Seamless Gate completely offguard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sudden appearance
and his explosion of terrifying power had instantly smacked the army
of the Seamless Gate senseless. They had completely and irrevocably
collapsed, and so the result was that this battle, the most critical
battle in the Three Realms in the war for karmic luck, had ended
after just a few short months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser major
world. Within the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan had hosted a huge celebratory feast, and had invited many major
powers and the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who had fought in the
battle to take part. Although Ning took part in the banquet as well,
he left very early on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was seated within a
gazebo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flakes of snow drifted
about around him. Ning sat there by himself, a flagon of wine and a
wineglass in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He quietly sipped his
wine. As it flowed into his throat, it brought a stream of warmth
with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…according to what World God Northrest told me,
all things are possible within the endless primordial chaos.” A
distant gaze was in Ning’s eyes. “Even Vastheaven Palace itself
has figures that were far more powerful than World God Northrest. In
the primordial chaos, there are figures that vastly, vastly outstrip
World Gods like him in might…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The World God stage
isn’t the end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once one reaches the
World God stage, one can find a truesoul within the River of
Destiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your truesoul has
been destroyed. Not even World Gods can save you. But if in the
future, I can surpass the World God stage and reach an even higher
level, perhaps I will be able to save you.” This was what Ning was
quietly saying to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
accepted Ning as his successor. He had thus left behind many
techniques, as well as many records on some of the nearby powers and
much knowledge regarding the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Ning knew
very well that the most precious item which World God Northrest had,
the divine sword ‘Violetjewel’, was something that was far beyond
the capabilities of World Gods and Chaos Immortals to create. Ning
knew for a fact that in the primordial chaos, there existed figures
more powerful than even World Gods and Chaos Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ning
didn’t have much ambition; he had felt that being able to survive
this tribulation and live a peaceful life afterwards in the Three
Realms would be enough. Even though in the future, his lifeblood oath
would force him to go search for Vastheaven Palace, that would be
something that would only happen in the distant future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
ambition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to walk
further down the path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the war ends,
I’ll leave behind my Primaltwin to take care of my daughter, then
go do what my lifeblood oath requires me to do. I’ll enter the
primordial chaos and search for Vastheaven Palace. I’ll climb up
ever-higher mountains and move higher and higher…because so long as
the path of Immortal cultivation is truly endless, there will come
the day that I will rescue you,” Ning silently promised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” A voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head.
Someone had just entered the courtyard. It was senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon looked at
Ning. He could sense Ning’s hidden loneliness, and he couldn’t
help but sigh to himself. When Silvermoon’s Dao-companion had just
perished, he had been just as Ning was now. Much time had to pass
before he was able to control his emotions and laugh gaily once
more….but in truth, he was doing nothing more than suppressing
those feelings in his heart. He had never forgotten them, and when
the chance to give vent to them had come, he had let them explode
forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he looked at Ning,
he felt as though he was looking at his past self.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon walked over,
then seated himself in front of Ning. He stared at the winecup on the
table. “Just one cup?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve come,
there will naturally be one more.” Ning waved his hand, and yet
another winecup appeared on the table. Ning picked up the flagon of
wine and poured a cup for his senior apprentice-brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gurgle gurgle.
Silvermoon tasted the wine, then raised his head and downed it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wine’s pretty
strong.” Silvermoon chuckled. “I came to see you because I was
worried that you’d let yourself grow depressed and dispirited, or
that you’d be completely consumed by your hatred. But now, it
seems, you are quite calm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I’m
calm. I still have my daughter, Brightmoon. I also have Uncle White,
Little Qing, and the others, along with my mother and father,” Ning
said calmly. Although his parents had perished, if he was able to
become a World God he would be able to locate their souls in the
River of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. There are many
things left in the world for us to cherish.” Silvermoon nodded, but
his eyes were filled with a murderous look. “But the Seamless Gate
really will stoop to anything. They actually launched assassinations
on a massive scale against the family members and loved ones of many
Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and Daofathers. So many have
perished!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
couldn’t hide the murderous look in his own eyes either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he thought of how
the Godking had stood there atop the walls of the Seamless Citadel,
crushing the soul of his wife in his fingers and disintegrating her
truesoul…Ning’s hatred began to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to kill this
‘Godking’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the top of that
solitary mountain peak, the Lord of All Fiends was meeting with the
Lord of the Demonheart. Blackheaven stood respectfully to one side,
not saying a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was quite a
miserable loss,” the gray-robed figure said softly, a hint of
amusement in his words. “A pity. A pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you the one
who forced this great tribulation upon us?” The Lord of All Fiends
said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, your
words are in error. It wasn’t that I forced this tribulation to
occur; rather, if I didn’t take action, we would be completely
wiped out.” The gray-robed figure chuckled, “Thus, our only
choice is to fight. Only if the Nuwa Alliance is completely
annihilated shall we be able to survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what is the
true source of this calamitous war?” The Lord of All Fiends
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I do not know.
I am part of the Heavenly Daos, but they are not all mine.” The
gray-robed figure shook his head. “No matter what…I still hope
that the Seamless Gate will be the one to win. Although I have become
part of the Heavenly Daos…in the past, I was the king of the
Seamless Chaosworld, after all. I truly don’t wish to see the
Seamless Gate be completely wiped out, or perhaps see you lead a tiny
band of survivors in fleeing from the Three Realms. In the end, my
hope is simply that the living beings who shall prosper and thrive
within the Three Realms shall be the living beings of the Seamless
Chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figure
continued, “As for the war for karmic luck…the battle for the
Deerchaser major world was the critical battle. Unfortunately, we
lost. We lost due to a completely unexpected variable. He is neither
a Daofather nor a True God, and he hasn’t even reached the fifth
stage of heartforce or swordforce. However…he was still able to
unleash the full, complete power of the Rahu Formation. Now that he
has acquired the Envoy, he has become the greatest impediment to our
side winning the war for karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has indeed.”
The Lord of All Fiends nodded. “Do you have any ideas for dealing
with him? Given his power, he can have his true body control the Rahu
Formation while his Primaltwin controls the Envoy. Even if I sent
four or five Envoys against him, they wouldn’t really be able to do
anything to him. Don’t forget that the army of the Nuwa Alliance is
incredibly powerful as well. Without the Envoys, there’s no way
that we can possibly overcome them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has become
the sharpest fang of all in the maws of the Nuwa Alliance.” The
gray-robed figure chuckled calmly. “The best way to deal with such
a fang…is to pull it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pull it out?” The
Lord of All Fiends was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
gray-robed figure nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How?” The Lord of
All Fiends’ face changed. He could vaguely sense at what Lord
Demonheart was proposing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have True Gods and
Daofathers act. Attack and kill Ji Ning.” This was the gray-robed
figure’s response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
instantly frowned. It was exactly as he has suspected. He immediately
said unhappily, “There is reason why neither we nor the Nuwa
Alliance have been willing to allow True Gods or Daofathers to get
involved and launch the Endwar, and are instead competing to win the
war for karmic luck first. That reason is because both of our sides
are very close to each other in power. If we really were to launch
the Endwar, our casualties would be catastrophic. If we were to have
a True God or Daofather strike, the Nuwa Alliance would be enraged
and probably send their major powers to intervene. If this happens,
it’s very possible that the Endwar will immediately begin as a
result.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps it will. But
perhaps it won’t.” The gray-robed figure said calmly, “With
this new variable, Ji Ning, entering into the mix, our chances for
winning the war for karmic luck have become very low. If that’s the
case…we might as well start the Endwar right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s more…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These so-called
‘unspoken rules’ were meant to be broken. True Gods and
Daofathers are forbidden from intervening? When things really come to
a head, why care about such foolish rules? The only thing that
matters is killing Ji Ning! If the Nuwa Alliance goes crazy, then
let’s fight! They’ll be caught completely unprepared…and given
that they are currently winning the war for karmic luck, they
probably wouldn’t be willing to launch the Endwar just yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, even if we
actually kill Ji Ning and cause the Endwar, we would be the side with
the upper hand as we would already be prepared for it. If the Endwar
doesn’t begin? That’s even better. In short…no matter what the
result is, it won’t be that bad for us,” the gray-robed figure
said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
seemed to be intrigued by his words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if we just let
things develop…we are on track to lose the war for karmic luck for
certain,” the gray-robed figure said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was silent for a long moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figure
just watched him. He had become part of the Heavenly Daos, after all;
the one who truly was in control of the Seamless Gate and made the
decisions for it was now the Lord of All Fiends! To violate the
unspoken accords of the major powers and to have True Gods and
Daofathers act to assassinate Ji Ning…this was a decision which
only the Lord of All Fiends could make.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. No matter what
the end result is, it won’t be that bad for us. I’ve never wanted
to actually see the Endwar descend upon us…but it is no longer
avoidable.” The Lord of All Fiends shook his head. “Since that’s
the case…then let us anoint our war-banner with Ji Ning’s blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figure
laughed.

Chapter 22 - A Deadly Crisis
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remnants of the
Seamless Gate’s army departed from the Deerchaser world, the scene
of the Seamless Gate’s most catastrophic defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they were leading
their shattered forces away, their hearts filled with misery, the
black-robed Godking and Daomother Devilhand were both stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendlord is
summoning us?” The Godking was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is Windfiend
summoning us? He never gets involved in these things.” Daomother
Devilhand was puzzled as well. Neither of them, however, hesitated at
all. They immediately sent their coresense to the Allfiend world,
using it to manifest an incarnation that descended upon it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
Windfiend Palace. At the very tip of the palace, clouds and mist
could be seen swirling about four figures who had gathered here.
These four could be considered the true leaders of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the Lord of
All Fiends, the Keeper of the Everwood, Daomother Devilhand, and the
black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master, why
have you summoned all of us here?” The black-robed Godking had the
lowest status of the four, and so he spoke in an extremely respectful
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood and
Daomother Devilhand looked towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
said solemnly, “Just now, Demonheart showed himself. He had a chat
with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone’s
hearts clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Demonheart….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The undisputed king of
the Seamless Chaosworld. Everywhere he went, he brought warfare with
him. There were no enemies that could stand against him, and no one
could surpass him in his mastery of strategy and in his mastery of
the heart. He had led the Seamless Chaosworld in its war against the
Pangu Chaosworld, and had inflicted repeated, disastrous defeats upon
the Pangu Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But at the critical
moment, the alien Outsider known as the Lord of All Things who had
been manipulating the conflict behind the scenes made his appearance.
Then, Mother Nuwa had suddenly made a breakthrough to become a
Pangu-level God as well, allowing her to absolutely dominate all her
enemies. Only then did Demonheart suffer such a humiliating defeat.
However, no one doubted Demonheart’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He appeared?”
Keeper Everwood frowned. “He’s already merged himself into the
Heavenly Daos. Even if he did appear, it would’ve been nothing more
than a clone that was manifested from the natural energy of Heaven
and Earth. He was the one who started the first war. What is he
scheming now?” Keeper Everwood was the most peace-loving member of
the Seamless Gate. He was extremely unhappy with how Demonheart had
caused this new war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the secret
whispers of fate had also indicated to him that if they didn’t
fight, the only result would be utter annihilation. Thus, there was
no way for him to oppose it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood.” The
Lord of All Fiends looked towards him. “I know what type of a
person you are…but you need to understand that at a time like this,
we simply cannot be merciful and soft-hearted. To be merciful to them
is the same as being merciless to our brothers, elders, and
younglings of the Seamless Chaosworld! Now that things have reached
the life-and-death stage, we need to be even more merciless than
before!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood nodded,
his aura becoming a bit more vicious. “Don’t worry. When the time
comes…I won’t show mercy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have already lost
the war for the Deerchaser world.” The Lord of All Fiends
continued, “This was because a major new variable appeared. Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is clearly
just an Empyrean God and True Immortal, but he was able to wield his
Rahu Formation to great effect, unleashing a level of power that was
comparable to that of a elite Daofather’s. In fact, he was able to
completely suppress the Envoy of All Things in might. Now that Ji
Ning also has the Envoy in his hands…he is like a tiger that has
gained wings. If Ji Ning is to appear on any battlefield during the
rest of the war for karmic luck, the advantage we have from our
Envoys would be completely nullified.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s too
formidable.” The black-robed Godking couldn’t help but agree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have always left
the decision of how to handle Ji Ning up to you.” Daomother
Devilhand said coldly, “And now, that young fellow has grown up to
become such a dangerous threat. Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Godking’s face changed slightly, but he forced down the rage he
felt in his heart. Daomother Devilhand was the easily agitated sort.
In the past, there were times when she wouldn’t even give
Demonheart any face, to say nothing of a junior like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was wrong.” The
black-robed Godking lowered his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” The Lord
of All Fiends continued, “In the war for karmic luck, the Nuwa
Alliance has its three major formations while we have our Envoys.
We’re able to give them a good run for their money. But now that Ji
Ning has appeared, and now that we’ve lost the most critical
battle…our chances of winning the war for karmic luck are quite
slim.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them felt
heaviness in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, Demonheart
suggested to me…that we should simply go kill Ji Ning,” the Lord
of All Fiends said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go kill him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This could very well
cause the Endwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of the others
were shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
said, “At first, I didn’t agree with him either. However, when I
thought it over carefully, I realized that Demonheart was right. If
we kill Ji Ning, we’ll be able to take back the Envoy. Even if the
Endwar begins, we’ll be prepared for it while they won’t be. And
of course, if the Nuwa Alliance isn’t willing to start the Endwar,
that’ll be even better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
swept the other three with his gaze. “To tell the truth, we can all
subconsciously sense the enormous danger that hangs over our heads.
This danger is the danger of annihilation, and it has made all of us
nervous. However, there’s no way to escape the Endwar. Sooner or
later, it will come. When it does come, I want the three of you to
stay close to me. If the situation turns grim, or if an unexpected
variable appears like another alien Outsider, I’ll immediately lead
you all in fleeing from the Three Realms. As long as we are able to
survive, hope remains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Everyone
present nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before planning for
victory, first plan for defeat. With the Lord of All Fiends on their
side, the Seamless Gate’s chances of escape would clearly be quite
good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations for the Endwar,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
“Although I predict that the chances of the Nuwa Alliance actually
launching it are quite low, we still need to prepare for it. Inform
that ally of ours as well. As soon as we make our move, his entire
army has to move as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. There’s
no way we can let him just sit there and mop up the survivors,”
Keeper Everwood said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” They all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our strike against
Ji Ning has to be successful,” the Lord of All Fiends said. “The
Nuwa Alliance has just won a great victory, and their army is
currently celebrating. Ji Ning is currently within Xuan Yuan’s
imperial palace. If we are going to attack, let’s attack Xuan
Yuan’s palace and slay Ji Ning on the spot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack him inside
the imperial palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t we going to
wait for Ji Ning to come out? If he comes out by himself, things will
be much easier for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend is
correct. Right now, the Nuwa Alliance is probably feeling fairly
confident and relaxed, as Ji Ning is inside the imperial palace. But
once he leaves, it’s possible that Daofather Subhuti will travel
alongside him. Even if we were to attack, Subhuti would be able to
instantly protect Ji Ning or collect him into a treasure, giving us
no chance to attack at all.” Keeper Everwood agreed with the Lord
of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
nodded. “Although the palace is a dangerous place, at least he is
by himself. When we make our move, there won’t be enough time for
Subhuti and Xuan Yuan to intervene. But of course, striking within
the palace will be quite difficult, as Xuan Yuan’s surrounded his
home with many formations.” As he spoke, he turned to look at
Keeper Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood, you have
many tricks up your sleeve. You should be able to temporarily tie
down the Three Sovereigns by yourself for a short period of time, so
you have to be involved in this. Help us tie down the major powers of
the Nuwa Alliance,” the Lord of All Fiends instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood nodded
and sighed. “Don’t worry. I’ve sparred against those old
friends of mine countless times. Even if all three of them come
against me at the same time, I’ll be able to hold them off for a
short period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll also have to
invite Darklight and Shadowless,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme figures of
the Seamless Gate began to make their plans against Ji Ning,
carefully plotting his death in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They even came up with
two contingency plans. If the first plan failed, they would use the
contingency plan. If the contingency plan failed, they’d use the
second contingency plan. In short, they were determined to make this
mission a success. They also had to take back the Envoy of All
Things! However, slaying Ji Ning was the most important part of this
mission, with taking back the Envoy being a secondary goal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance,
however, knew nothing of the Seamless Gate’s secret plotting. This
was because very few members of the Seamless Gate were involved in
it; less than fifteen in total! The vast majority of the major powers
of the Seamless Gate were kept in the dark, with only their most
supreme leaders and some of the most loyal, elite Daofathers knowing
that they were to make their preparations for the Endwar. Each of
these figures had multiple Daofathers under their command; once the
Endwar actually began, they would be able to give the order and
ensure that all of the major powers of the Seamless Gate would
respond in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as the major
powers weren’t caught off-guard, the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals under them wouldn’t be caught off-guard either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
was seated silently in the lotus position, training in the [Solitary
World God] technique. If he was able to break through and become a
True God prior to the Endwar erupting, he would become much more
powerful than he was now. The [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] technique
and the [One True Body] technique had given him the power of a
half-step True God already. If he was able to make a true
breakthrough, he would be equivalent to a half-step Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, he was very far
away from becoming a Daofather of the Great Firmament, because he had
to first master a Heavenly Dao. In contrast, it was possible for one
to become a True God after mastering one of the Grand Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was merely
‘possible’; more than eighty percent of Empyrean Gods had
mastered a Grand Dao, but how many of them were able to become True
Gods?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had already
mastered a Grand Dao as well! The Grand Dao of Lightning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had left
Undermoon Lake, Ning had quickly mastered the Dao of Rainwater and
the Dao of the Thunderclap. During the month that he had spent
training in the [Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique, he had silently
and soundlessly mastered the Grand Dao of Lightning! Surprisingly, it
was actually the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop, which he had once
mastered in the past, which remained incomplete. He would most likely
need another ten days or so to re-master it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His foundation was
simply far too profound. His sword-arts were at such a high level
that he was able to understand these Daos at an absolutely
astonishing level of speed.

Chapter 23 - Binding the Envoy of All Things
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he had mastered
the [Five Treasures] sword-art, comprehending other Daos became a
much faster process. However, if a major power was to train the [Five
Treasures] but be unable to master it and instead be trapped at a
bottleneck while being unable to master any other Daos…that would
be utterly disastrous. The only reason why Ji Ning was willing to
risk it was because he hadn’t possessed that high a level of
attainment in other Daos to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji Ning
waved his hand and a gourd appeared by his side. Staring at the
gourd, Ning said to himself in a soft voice, “It’s time to bind
the Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pop. He pulled the
stopper out of the gourd, then pulled out the flame-wreathed,
ape-shaped Envoy of All Things. It collapsed to the ground, still
bound up by that Protocosmic spirit-rope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy opened its
eyes, glaring angrily at Ning. “You captured me…but you can
forget about getting the Envoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?” The
black-robed Ning replied coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if you have
me all tied up? You have no way of coming in.” The Envoy growled,
“Nor can you deal any damage at all to this golem. Forget about
you; even the most powerful figures of the Three Realms wouldn’t be
able to damage it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
simply can forcibly bind the Envoy, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forcibly bind it? A
Daofather, maybe. You?” The Envoy’s controller snorted angrily.
“Come and try!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the Envoy was
essentially a magic treasure, and the owner of this magic treasure
was Empyrean God Bloodwave, located in the heart of it! Bloodwave
believed that since Ji Ning was also just an Empyrean God/True
Immortal, their divine power and Immortal energy should be on the
same level. There was no way Ji Ning would be able to bind the Envoy
by force, because he would be constantly using his own energy to
resist and counter Ji Ning’s binding efforts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s try and
see.” The black-robed Ning waved a finger. Instantly, a torrid
flood of energy flowed into the Envoy. As soon as this happened, Ning
could instantly sense the control which Bloodwave had over the Envoy.
Bloodwave was already the master of the Envoy, and so he had the
advantage of incumbency. There was no way that someone on a similar
level of power to Bloodwave could possibly seize the golem from under
his control. However…Daofather-level energy was clearly vastly
beyond the ability of Bloodwave to counteract, and it began to seep
into the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle, crackle,
crackle. The energy continued to flow into the golem, taking over
more and more parts of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
Bloodwave was stunned. “How could this Immortal energy be this
powerful? How could…” He could clearly sense how powerful and
pure the invading energy was. It was vastly beyond the Pure Yang True
Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-you’ve become
a Daofather?” Bloodwave didn’t dare believe it. “Impossible. If
you became a Daofather, you would’ve had to first master a Heavenly
Dao. If that had happened, there would’ve been no way to hide it at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just chuckled
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, there was no
way to hide gaining mastery over a Heavenly Dao. The resonance effect
this would create with the Heavenly Daos would instantly be
discovered by the Lord of the Demonheart, who was himself a part of
the Heavenly Daos. However, Ning was ‘only’ a True Immortal who
had a Jindan that was comparable to a first-tier Jindan. If his
Jindan had actually been a real first-tier Jindan, then when he used
the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] and [One True Body] techniques, he
would’ve become even more powerful than actual first-tier True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the only way to
gain such a Jindan was to manifest it during the Celestial
Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. You must
be a Daofather. How could you have become a Daofather?” Bloodwave
simply couldn’t understand it, no matter how hard he tried.
Suddenly, he thought of the fact that not even the major powers on
his side knew that Ji Ning had become a Daofather. This definitely
had to be an important secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a surge of
coresense burst forth from the Envoy’s body, charging outwards and
seeking to escape the estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to reveal
my secret?” Ning laughed calmly. “Don’t even try it. There’s
no way your coresense can make it out of this estate-treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the coresenses
of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would be able to penetrate and
scan this estate-treasure, to say nothing of Empyrean God Bloodwave’s
coresense. So long as Ning did not permit it, there was no way his
coresense would be able to escape to the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t worried
about Bloodwave revealing his secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God
Bloodwave…didn’t have a Primaltwin! And if did have incarnations
in the outside world, it wouldn’t matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What was an
‘incarnation’? Even Void-level Fiendgods were capable of
transforming a plucked bit of hair or a single drop of blood into an
incarnation. At the Daofather level, incarnations could be manifested
with but a thought. However, incarnations were only capable of
surviving so long as the true body was alive. In fact, for Void-level
Fiendgods, incarnations had to stay within a certain distance of the
true body, as they would otherwise automatically dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daofathers had to
maintain a continuous connection to their incarnations to maintain
them. This was because it was this hidden connection to and support
from the true body that gave the incarnation a mind, a will, and the
ability to speak and chat with others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that when one lost a large part of one’s soul, roughly seventy or
eighty percent, the surviving portion would eventually crumble apart
and die. If the loss was even more significant, one could die on the
spot. The incarnation of a Daofather didn’t have any part of the
Daofather’s soul within it at all. Why, then, was it able to
‘live’? Precisely because it relied on the true body for its
survival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, Bloodwave was
trapped within the estate-world. This estate-world treasure was one
which Ning had specially chosen out of the many estate-world
treasures he had acquired from the prisoners of Pangaea. It was the
most mysterious of all estate-worlds, capable of refusing even the
senses of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. It was capable of
severing all contact between its insides and the outside world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the connection was
severed, any incarnations that Bloodwave might’ve had in the
outside world would dissipated due to its inability to connect to the
true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how angry and
resentful Bloodwave was, all he could do was stare as Ning continued
the binding process. And after spending roughly an hour, Ning finally
succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” This
was the only thing Ning commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodwave was forcibly
teleported out. Eyes completely bloodshot, he charged towards Ji Ning
in a berserk manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-robed Ning’s gaze turned cold. The Thirty-Six Heavens
instantly appeared around him in the form of flags, and they linked
together to instantly and complete surround Bloodwave. Slash! Slash!
Slash! Bloodwave cried out miserably and furiously as he was ground
to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference between
a Daofather and an Empyrean God was simply far too great. Unless
there was some incredibly special circumstances involved, it would be
extremely hard to overcome such a vast gulf in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Envoy of All
Things.” The black-robed Ning first willed the Thirty-Six Heavens
to disappear, and then he blinked inside of the ‘body’ of the
Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a marvelous,
intricate golem.” As Ning entered, he continued to explore the
Envoy with his senses. Even he, the controller, was not capable of
discovering a way to damage the golem in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, this
golem is in perfect shape.” Ning secretly rejoiced to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the war that
ended the Primordial Era, the Lord of All Things had commanded an
entire host of Envoys. When he had died, the critical mechanisms
inside the Envoys had actually initiated self-destruct sequences.
Although Mother Nuwa had defeated him and won his Envoys, they were
in reality nothing more than completely useless, shattered bits of
metal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
understand was that the Envoys which the Lord of All Things used were
completely different from the Envoys which Grandmaster Blackheaven
had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Things
had used cruel, brutal methods to capture souls of Daofathers, then
smelt them into the Envoys, ensuring that every single Envoy was
absolutely loyal to him. An unwaveringly loyal army was what the Lord
of All Things required, and as soon as he died his loyal Envoys
self-destructed, ensuring that their enemies would never have a
chance to acquire them. Grandmaster Blackheaven certainly didn’t
have the ability to capture a Daofather’s soul or smelt it into an
Envoy; all he was able to do was have a living Daofather command it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
golem…and is this part here the core? These five chaos jewels?”
Ning discovered the energy source of the Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods were able
to use the Envoy to unleash the power of a elite Daofather. The
energy source of an Envoy, however, was of course not the Empyrean
God himself. Its power came from these five chaos jewels, which each
contained unique attributes stemming from the elements of metal,
wood, water, fire, and earth. Joined together, they were able to
unleash absolutely shocking amounts of power. There was simply no way
for an Empyrean God to completely control such power. A Daofather,
however, would be able to do so, and a Daofather in control would
result in the Envoy having even more power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel powerful,
even more powerful than when I am in control of a Rahu God. No wonder
it is capable of unleashing a level of power close to that of the
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism.” Ning was truly stunned. Mostly
likely, ten of his Rahu Gods would be needed to match up with this
Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
between a Empyrean God controlling it and a Daofather controlling it
was simply enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous imperial
palace. Ji Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only now did I have
a chance to meet with you, Darknorth. I’m quite embarrassed.”
Empyrean God Owldragon and a host of other Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals had come to visit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
received them with a smile on his face. He could sense the gratitude,
respect, and excitement these visiting Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals felt. All of them understood that Ning had been the
greatest contributor to their victory in the battle for the
Deerchaser world! The greatest hero of them all! In addition, given
the power which Ning had put on display today, he would definitely be
able to unleash utterly astonishing levels of power during the
upcoming final battles in the war for karmic luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s
formidableness meant that their side would have a better chance of
winning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course these
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would feel excited and grateful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve entrusted
me with their hopes…but in truth, it doesn’t change anything.
Seamless Gate…no matter what, I will use all my strength to fight
against it.” After sending these Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
away, Ning walked by himself along the railing, staring at the
endless, starry skies. “And the Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m definitely
going to kill him.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Allfiend
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything needs to
be carried out according to the plan.” The Lord of All Fiends sat
by himself at the peak of the mountain, staring into the endless
Void. His voice passed through the Void, reaching the minds of the
major powers spread throughout the other worlds. “In this mission
to kill Ji Ning and take back the Envoy, as long as we move quickly
enough we should be able to succeed fairly easily. However, there is
a chance that the Endwar will begin as a result. Everyone, make your
preprations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Fiendlord.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve all made our

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten-plus most
powerful figures of the entire Seamless Gate all understood that this
night was likely to be the most important night they had experienced
in countless eons. This was a night where the major powers of both
alliances would battle, a night which could well cause the Endwar to
erupt. The last Endwar had caused the destruction of two chaosworlds;
from this, one could tell how devastating a battle between major
powers could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we are about to
fight soon…” A violet-robed woman was seated in the lotus
position atop a jade bed. Her arms were sparkling white and
crystalline, while a faint hint of eagerness could be seen within her
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the supreme powers
of the Seamless Gate, she was the one who loved battle the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We absolutely cannot
afford to lose this battle.” A man dressed in similar violet robes
who had a wooden ruler on his back was seated within an ordinary
wooden room. He waved his hand, and the wooden ruler on his back fell
into his grasp. The Keeper of the Everwood gently stroked the wooden
ruler with his hand as he stared at it. He said in a soft voice, “Old
friend, we are going to go into battle together once more. The last
time we fought together was during the war that ended the Primordial
Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thrum…the wooden
ruler vibrated slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood’s
face turned solemn and his eyes turned cold. Although he disliked
battle, when the time came for them to fight he absolutely would not
show mercy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendlord is a
bit too cautious. He prepared a total of three plans for us, and
we’re attacking from ambush. There’s no way Ji Ning will even be
able to assemble the Rahu Formation in time. Killing him will be as
easy as killing a chicken. The primary plan is more than enough. In
fact, there’s no need for us to even involve Shadowless in this. I
by myself am more than enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An icy look flashed
through the eyes of this skinny old man who had a hideous,
centipede-like scar across his face. This man was Swordfather
Darklight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had reached the
fifth stage of swordforce, and he could be considered the Seamless
Gate’s number one expert in the art of assassinations. His sword
was known as the Darklight Sword, and it was named that because
enemies were unable to see his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first plan the
Seamless Gate initiated only involved a tiny number of major powers.
It was kept extraordinarily secret, and so no one in the Nuwa
Alliance noticed anything at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Deerchaser world.
The imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
was seated facing Silvermoon. Both were staring at the countless
stars in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Peaceful days are
the best.” Silvermoon stared at the starry skies, then said softly,
“But I wonder how long this peace will last.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the war is
over, everything will be right again.” Ning stared at the stars as
well. “The tree wishes to be still, but the wind continues to blow.
Although we wish to live peaceful lives, there’s a reason for this
war. Only when we sever the hand that is manipulating things behind
the scenes and slay the major powers who are focused on causing
trouble and chaos throughout the Three Realms will peace return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Silvermoon
chuckled. “Fortunately, we have you on our side. I really wonder
what you experienced in Undermoon Lake, junior apprentice-brother.
You are merely an Empyrean God, but you are able to unleash such
incredible levels of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled but didn’t
reply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone who had
emerged from Undermoon Lake, including all of the two hundred-plus
Empyrean Gods, had been completely silent about their experiences
there. Everyone including Silvermoon knew that it wasn’t that they
were unwilling to speak, it had to be that they were unable to speak,
and so no one tried to force the story out of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? We’ve finished
the wine.” Silvermoon lifted up the canteen, giving it a few shakes
before laughing and rising to his feet. “Alright. Now that the
wine’s all gone, it’s time for me to leave. No need to send me
off.” As he spoke, he took a step forward and flew downwards, then
lazily sauntered off into the distance. As he left, he called out in
a loud voice, “Just make sure you help me kill a few more of those
Seamless Gate bastards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No problem,” Ning
called back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous battle,
Silvermoon’s capabilities had been tremendously degraded. He had
lost more than half of his soul, resulting in him now being extremely
weak. There was no way he could take part in battle at all. In truth,
Ning could’ve let him quickly recover his soul by giving him just a
tiny bit of chaos nectar, but Ning knew that given Silvermoon’s
temperament, he would immediately choose to rejoin the war once more
upon being healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was best to let him
stay in the back safely for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And these Nine Chaos
Seals are truly unspeakably marvelous.” Ning waved his hand,
producing one of the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens. The more insight
he gained into the Nine Chaos Seals which each goldstar bead
contained, the more marvelous he felt them to be. Meditating on them
allowed Ning to more easily understand and master the sword-arts left
behind by World God Northrest, and it even made it a bit easier for
him to comprehend the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had originally
thought them to be fairly ordinary chaos seals that had been found in
the primordial chaos, but after learning the many techniques
transmitted to him by World God Northrest, Ning felt all the more
convinced of how extraordinary these Nine Chaos Seals were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps in the
future, when I find Vastheaven Palace in the primordial chaos, I’ll
be able to learn the history behind the creation of the Nine Chaos
Seals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to hold
the goldstar beads in his hands, meditating on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending two
hours in meditation, it was now very late at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning
suddenly, inexplicably felt his heartrate quicken, and a shiver
flashed through his soul. In fact, his subconscious was now screaming
that an utterly terrifying danger was descending upon him, so
unfathomably vast and deadly that Ning’s heart was naturally filled
with an aura of despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
was shocked. Ever since he had mastered the second of the Nine Chaos
Seals and became capable of transforming the goldstar beads in the
Mirrors of the Heavens, Ning’s subconscious connection to the
whispers of fate had become much stronger than before. But this time,
things had happened without any warning whatsoever. Only when the
danger had already descended upon him did the warning come, filling
him with utter terror. Clearly, his foe’s mastery over fate and
destiny was far superior to Ning’s, allowing him to even muffle the
whispers of fate, which was why Ning didn’t sense anything until
the very end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And by now…it was too
late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” Faced with
such danger, Ning’s only thought was of flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like a peacock
spreading his tail feathers, streaks of black light instantly swished
towards Ning in a fan-like manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were completely
silent but incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Ning
noticed the fan-shaped streaks of black light, they had already
reached him. The only thing that Ning could do was use the
[Starseizing Hand] to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. The
fan-shaped streaks of black light instantly and completely penetrated
through Ning’s body. Although Ning’s body was protected by the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], it was still unable to defend against the
black streaks of light. The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was completely
shattered, and even his divine body was unable to withstand this
attack. The golden pellet Jindan in his body, along with his soul,
wasn’t able to withstand it either…and both were instantly
annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
that had been sitting there was instantly reduced to nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. So what if he
is powerful? So what if he has the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]? So
what if he has the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]?” A skinny old man
appeared in the air above the palace. It was Swordfather Darklight of
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mission was
extremely critical, and Ning possessed the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] evasion technique. If he was given any time to escape, he
would definitely be able to do so. Thus, the Seamless Gate had
invited their most skilled assassin, Swordfather Darklight, to
engage. His sword was both secretive enough and powerful enough to
instantly wipe out Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Swordfather
Darklight had failed, allowing Ji Ning to flee with his [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent], then the next to strike would be the Lord of All
Fiends, who had the most terrifyingly fast movement technique in all
of the Three Realms. The Lord of All Fiends would personally strike!
His evasion technique was far superior to Ji Ning’s; not even the
Golden Crow ‘King of Monsters’ of the ancient days could match up
to the Lord of All Fiends in speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been too
relaxed and unguarded here in the imperial palace of Yellow Emperor
Xuan Yuan. He had placed too much faith in Subhuti and Xuan Yuan, and
had too much confidence in himself. And so…he had instantly been
killed. He didn’t even have the chance to use the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] to escape, and so there was no need for the Lord
of All Fiends to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two powerful aura
instantly burst forth from within the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DARKLIGHT!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enraged roar
instantly shook the entire world. This white-bearded, robed old man
normally always had a calm, merry smile on his face…but now, he was
filled with a towering desire to kill. His senses were quite acute
and quite quick, but by the time he sensed what was happening, Ji
Ning’s true body had already been slain, completely unable to fight
back whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti, don’t be
hasty.” A second, calm voice rang out within the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A violet-robed man
appeared in the air above the imperial palace. He held a wooden ruler
in his hands, and he pointed it at the distant Patriarch Subhuti.
Instantly, a blurry violet light instantly sprang up to surround
Patriarch Subhuti. Even the stunned and enraged Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan was completely surrounded by the blurry violet light. Upon being
trapped by it, Patriarch Subhuti and Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan
actually found that they were temporarily unable to break free from
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shatter!”
Patriarch Subhuti waved his finger. Whoosh…the spacetime around him
began to splinter apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless.”
The violet-robed figure stood there calmly in the air. Although
spacetime around him was shattering apart in layers, the boundless
violet light was able to once more forcibly recompress and seal those
layers together. In terms of pure defensive capabilities, Keeper
Everwood was the most formidable individual in the Seamless Gate.
Even if all three of the Three Sovereigns came, he would still be
able to hold them off by himself, much less a mere Subhuti and Xuan
Yuan.
</P>

Chapter 25 - The Summoning Call
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan was utterly besides himself with rage. This was his imperial
palace. The Seamless Gate dared to launch a frontal attack against
it? As soon as he found out that he was unable to immediately break
through the barrier of violet light, he manifested a divine sword
that glowed with dazzling golden light. This was the legendary
Xuanyuan sword! As the sword struck out, the entire imperial palace
began to glow with countless formations. The natural energy of Heaven
and Earth began to furiously gather here, causing the skies to turn
dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood…f*ck
off!” Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan exploded forth with an utterly
astonishing aura. Seemingly limitless amounts of power were being
concentrated within the Xuanyuan sword in his hands, and he delivered
a downwards chop!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet light parted
before the blow like the waves of the sea…but then it came together
to trap and crush the sword-light, repeatedly grinding away at it. If
you strike at water with a blade, the water will continue to flow.
Although the sword-light was able to temporarily split the violet
light apart, more of the violet light would come forth and merge
together anew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xuan Yuan, although
you are formidable in commanding armies, in a true one-on-one fight,
you are still far from being a match for me,” Keeper Everwood said
calmly. His gaze was actually focused on the distant form of
Subhuti…because he would sense that Daofather Subhuti was
transforming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve hidden
yourself away for countless years. Subhuti…I’m quite curious to
see how strong you are.” Keeper Everwood’s voice rang out next by
Subhuti’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was incredibly
mysterious. Even during the war that ended the Primordial Era, he had
only intervened a few times to save people. He hadn’t truly taken
part in the war. He possessed the most formidable fleeing abilities
within the Nuwa Alliance, and he was absolutely, unswervingly loyal
to them. Why was it that such a steadfast major power had refused to
take part in the war? The Seamless Gate’s guess…was that Subhuti
was most likely meant to be the escape path for the Nuwa Alliance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Pangu Chaosworld
had lost the war and was in true danger of annihilation, Subhuti
probably would’ve intervened to lead them all away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was the escape path for the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was quite
likely to be the escape path for the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the major powers
of the Seamless Gate had never dared to underestimate Subhuti. No one
knew exactly how strong he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…is my
disciple.” Subhuti’s beard fluttered in the wind, his entire body
emanating a heart-stopping aura of might. His ancient hands suddenly
increased explosively in size, becoming like two massive stormclouds
as he clawed forward with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even before his
heaven-covering palms actually struck the dense violet light, the
violet light began to split apart. The palms wildly smashed downwards
towards Keeper Everwood, and the closer they moved towards him, the
more powerfully the violet light resisted. However, Subhuti’s hands
were completely covered with dark black light, and they were
incomparably sharp. They tore through all obstacles as they grabbed
towards the midair Keeper Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew that you’d
be able to break through this protective light of mine.” Keeper
Everwood’s unearthly aura of violet light was nothing more than a
divine protective light that surrounded him. Xuan Yuan had used his
full power, but had still been unable to break through the barrier of
light. In terms of defense, Keeper Everwood was the undisputed number
one expert of the Seamless Gate, after all. Most likely, on the side
of the Nuwa Alliance, only Lord Tathagata the Buddha could compare
with him in terms of defensive strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha focused on
a few exquisite skills. Keeper Everwood, by contrast, dabbled a bit
in everything. He was skilled in almost everything! In formations, he
was probably close to being a match for even Fuxi. In close combat,
he was top-notch. In golem-making and pill-forging, he was quite the
expert as well. Although he wasn’t the best in the Three Realms, he
was definitely in the top three! This made Keeper Everwood extremely
difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Subhuti.”
Keeper Everwood stretched out the wooden ruler in his hand and
pointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The wooden
ruler instantly expanded to become thirty thousand meters long, and
it smashed downwards towards the pair of massive, heaven-covering
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….Heaven and
Earth both began to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You live up to the
stories. Show me all of your power, Subhuti.” Keeper Everwood
looked towards Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has truly used its full power to try and kill my disciple.” Subhuti
was frantic. He had immediately used one of his killer attacks, but
was still unable to do anything to his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suiren!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Purities!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and come
here!” Subhuti’s will covered the entire Three Realms as he urged
them to make haste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the distant
Mount Innerheart of the Crescent major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snooooore. Snooooore.
Snoooore. A skinny old man was snoring contentedly as he slept, a fan
placed against his chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crazy Ji, hurry up
and come to the Deerchaser world to save your junior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A voice suddenly echoed
within the old man’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny elder was
stunned. “The Deerchaser world is the base of Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan. Master is there as well…but he’s actually been forced to
call for reinforcements?” Crazy Ji no longer looked as relaxed as
he normally did. His face was now solemn, and a spatial whirlpool
appeared in front of him. Crazy Ji took a single step forward,
entering the spatial whirlpool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On other side of Mount
Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew! Down you go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A woodcutter, dressed
in cloth robes and straw shoes, was striking with his hatchet against
a large tree, slowly hacking away at it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodcutter, your
junior apprentice-brother is in danger at the Deerchaser major world.
The Seamless Gate has attacked, and even I cannot stop them. You can
decide for yourself whether or not you wish to come.” Subhuti’s
voice rang out in the woodcutter’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. A large
spatial whirlpool appeared before the woodcutter as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woodcutter no
longer seemed as laid back as he normally was. Instead, he hefted his
hatchet over his shoulders, staring calmly at the spatial whirlpool
tunnel before him. He was the most low-key figure of all of Mount
Innerheart. In fact, he remained at the base of the mountain, never
going to meet with Subhuti. However, he was indisputably the most
powerful disciple of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew what his
story was. In fact, no one even knew his real name. The only thing
Ning and the others knew…was that their senior brother was known as
the ‘woodcutter’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I go or not?
Ji Ning, that little kid who learned archery from me all those years
ago?” The woodcutter hefted his hatchet, a hint of amusement
playing at the corners of his lips. “They want to kill my junior
apprentice-brother…but they haven’t asked me if that’s
acceptable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Hatchet over
his shoulders, the woodcutter stepped into the spatial whirlpool
tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major world of
Flower-Fruit Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flower-Fruit Mountain
was an awe-inspiringly famous place back during the Primordial Era.
Surprisingly, in the Three Realms era it had become quite a low-key
locale. However, the leader of the monsters of Flower-Fruit Mountain
was a legendary figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was born from a
divine stone which Mother Nuwa had used to repair the heavens, and he
emerged from it filled with endless battle-lust!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He battled against
Heaven and battled against Earth. He was born to do battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had taught him,
while the Buddhists had tempered him. This truly changed him. Once, a
single displeasing word could cause this absolutely savage king to
lift up his staff and deliver a ferocious beatdown, but now he had
become very low-key. Every day, he spent his time on Flower-Fruit
Mountain with his minions, happily eating Immortal peaches and
drinking fine wine. When he wanted to sleep, he would use the natural
world as his bed and fall asleep on the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was like a piece of
jade that had originally been filled with imperfections but had now
been perfectly carved and polished, revealing all of its glorious
luster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wukong, your junior
apprentice-brother has encountered grave danger in the Deerchaser
world. The Seamless Gate seeks to kill him, and I, your master, am
unable to withstand them,” Subhuti sent to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hairy monkey had
previously been slouched casually upon a rock, watching as a pair of
ants battled. When Subhuti’s voice rang out in his mind, he was
momentarily startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They want to kill my
junior apprentice-brother?” The hairy monkey rose to his feet, his
entire body instantly becoming covered with a dazzling, sparkling
golden armor. A long staff appeared in his hands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kiddos, your king is
going to make a short trip.” His voice echoed in the air above
Flower-Fruit Mountain. As for the monkey king himself, he had already
pierced through the Void to move towards the Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had instantly
summoned the various major powers of the Nuwa Alliance. The
Daofathers of Mount Innerheart rarely joined forces, but this time
Subhuti summoned all of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Subhuti and Xuan
Yuan battled against Keeper Everwood, Ji Ning’s Primaltwin suddenly
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Swordfather
Darklight landed on the ground. As he did, he suddenly saw that a
black lightning serpent suddenly flew from the slain true body of Ji
Ning into a large seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An estate-world
treasure?” Swordfather Darklight instantly recognized what that
large seal was. Right at this moment, a figure suddenly emerged from
the large seal. It was the ape-shaped Envoy of All Things, its entire
body blazing with dark red flames. The Envoy’s face, however, had
changed. It now had Ji Ning’s face, and Ji Ning’s eyes were
filled with murder as he stared at the skinny old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was
overconfident.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was overconfident,
and I trusted too much in Master and the others. I forgot that my
situation is no longer the same as it was before. In the past, when I
was by Master’s side, he could completely shield me from all
dangers, blocking out the wind and the rain. There was no need for me
to worry about anything. However, I now have the power of a elite
Daofather, and when I control the Envoy I’m actually even more
powerful. I’m probably very close to even Master I power. At a time
like this, anyone capable of posing a threat to me is someone that
not even Master would necessarily be able to save me from.” Ning
had become completely clear-minded now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve actually
managed to bind the Envoy already? Quite fast. Hmph.” Swordfather
Darklight laughed coldly, “A pity that it’s useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfather Darkklight
stood there in the distance, staring towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, that
mysterious, unfathomable streak of black light once more appeared. If
last time, the black light was in the shape of a fan and possessed
incomparably dominating power that completely tore Ning’s divine
body apart, this time the black light was like an unending flow of
water. It was extremely gentle as it swept towards Ning, seeking to
swirl around him and bind him. So long as it could bind him, then it
would be able to capture him, much like how Ning himself had bound
and captured the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Presumptuous.”
Ning’s Envoy wielded a pair of divine swords in its hands, and its
right hand suddenly moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using his
Daofather-level energy to control the strength of the Envoy of All
Things. He used its terrifying, tremendous power to unleash his
fastest sword-strike. Sword-light lit up, and it was as though a bolt
of lightning had appeared in the black skies! His sword struck even
faster than thunder, and the powerful, penetrative force of this blow
pierced straight into the flowing, watery-like stream of black
sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clangclangclangclangclang…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An extremely fast
series of consecutive clanging sounds could be heard with over a
thousand sounds ringing out in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless thin
sword-shaped streams of light had appeared in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfather Darklight’s
sword-light was formed from countless finger-sized swords, each of
which was covered with a flowing layer of black light. The countless
slender swords, in the face of Ning’s single dazzling sword-strike,
were actually blasted apart by the force of the collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-stance was
the Blood Drop stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
Swordfather Darklight was shocked. Even amongst elite Daofathers, he
was ranked quite highly. He probably wasn’t much weaker than
Patriarch Subhuti. As he saw it, an Empyrean God in command of the
Envoy could perhaps just barely be a match for an ordinary elite
Daofather. Ji Ning should be no match for him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in reality…he was
actually at a disadvantage in this fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
suppressed me.” Swordfather Darklight was shocked. However, he knew
how important this mission was and so he didn’t waste any time
marveling at what had just happened. He immediately sent a mental
shout, “Shadowless, hurry up and attack! Are you just going to
watch as Ji Ning escapes?”

Chapter 26 - No Harming My Junior Apprentice-Brother!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
black-robed Ji Ning had attacked through his Envoy, he had
immediately suppressed Darklight. The power he had just displayed
stunned everyone. This definitely wasn’t the power of an ordinary
elite Daofather; it was a level of power that was extremely close to
that of the Three Sovereigns or the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism.
As for Daofather Shadowless? He was hidden in the shadows, but had no
time to think about this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to get rid
of him.” Daofather Shadowless launched his attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As the
Envoy-Ning struck out with his sword, suppressing Swordfather
Darklight, he immediately saw a pitch-black figure appear in front of
him. This pitch-black figure instantly split apart into six figures,
each of who wielded a bladed whip that could be used like a flexible
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six black figures
lashed out with their whips, filling the skies with them and
completely sealing off the area around Ning. They were like vipers,
coiling around Ning and prepared to strike at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather
Shadowless.” Ning could immediately guess at who this was. “The
Seamless Gate really thinks quite highly of me. They actually sent
their two best assassins to deal with me. The first was Swordfather
Darklight, who is skilled in long-distance attacks; the second is
Daofather Shadowless, who is skilled in close-range attacks. When the
two of them join forces, there aren’t many in the Three Realms who
can escape them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Shadowless
was a dual refiner, both a Daofather and a True God. He was far more
powerful than Daoist Threelives had been, and was a terrifying figure
who was every bit a match for the likes of Subhuti and Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
differences between Swordfather Darklight and Daofather Shadowless.
Swordfather Darklight used long-range treasures to attack, allowing
him to deliver an instant, death-dealing sword-stroke that was able
to unleash explosive power. However, in sustained battle, he was a
bit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Shadowless,
however, was a master of close combat! He trained in an extremely
bizarre divine ability that was known as the [Shadowless Fiend
Sutra]. Only a few of the absolute most elite major powers of the
Seamless Gate knew this technique, but the only one who had been able
to truly master it was Daofather Shadowless! This divine ability was
similar to the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], but of course there were
differences between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one used this
divine ability, one would be able to instantly manifest six mighty
clones! Each of the six clones would have the same level of power as
the original body, and they were like shadows. There was no way to
kill a shadow! When Daofather Shadowless activated this technique,
the six clones created would all look like mere shadows, with just
one of them containing his true body within it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, distinguishing
the true body from the five false ones was incredibly difficult, and
Daofather Shadowless was also able to easily alternate amongst his
six mighty clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability
allowed his power to increase dramatically, and also made him
virtually unkillable! Given that Daofather Shadowless had the power
of a elite Daofather to begin with, after he had mastered this
technique he had naturally become comparable to Subhuti and Old Man
Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break, break,
break!” Ji Ning was a peerless Sword Immortal, and his Envoy lashed
out with a pair of divine swords with frenzied abandon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Daofather
Shadowless was occasionally struck, each time it turned out that it
was only one of his ‘shadows’ that was hit. Daofather Shadowless
continued to strike with his frenzied whip-blocks, forcing Ning to
keep an extremely tight defense. If Ning made the slightest of
mistakes, the whips would most likely be able to wrap themselves
around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy-Ning battled
against Daofather Shadowless in close combat, the two furious
exchanging blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was completely
invulnerable to weapons and reputed to be the number one sword-user
of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other had six
indestructible bodies that could attack simultaneously, and also had
the long-distance support of Swordfather Darklight. The two could be
said to make a perfect pairing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been
completely shut down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do? My
attacks are useless against Daofather Shadowless, but his whip
strikes have completely tied me down here, restricting my movements.
And that damnable Swordfather Darklight…he keeps on interfering
with me as well. There’s nothing I can do; my only choice is to try
to buy time. The more time passes, the more major powers of the Nuwa
Alliance will get here,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all this took
time to describe, these major powers actually exchanged blows
lightning-fast against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments after Ning’s
true body had been ambushed and assassinated, his Primaltwin had
emerged with the Envoy of All Things and launched an attack,
resulting in Swordfather Darklight and Daofather Shadowless joining
forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right at this
moment…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EVERWOOD!!” An
enraged roar rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering figure clad
in just a fur loincloth had appeared in the skies, and the space
around him had been completely torn apart. Utterly terrifying waves
of flames were swirling around him, emanating an utterly horrifying
aura of power. But if one was able to stare deep into the flames…one
would unconsciously feel warmth in the heart, as though hope could be
seen living within the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Suiren’s
‘Eternal Kindlefire’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Suiren.” Ji
Ning, battered by Swordfather Darklight and Daofather Shadowless,
instantly felt hope in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suiren’s come.”
Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan was overjoyed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren was secretly
acknowledged by many as the number one expert of the Nuwa Alliance.
But of course, it was also possible that Lord Tathagata the Buddha
and Daoist Three Purities had made breakthroughs in recent years
which allowed them to surpass him! Still, for now at least, the level
of power that Suiren had made public was enough to let him stand at
the very peak of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mid-air Suiren was
wielding a long black staff in his hands. He brandished the stave,
unleashing an aura of endless power that struek out like a falling
star, smashing through all impediments. The violet light was
instantly shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just in time.”
Keeper Everwood struck out with his wooden ruler as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both weapons had
transformed to become three million meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wooden staff against
wooden ruler. The two collided, and the heavens themselves trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood was
knocked two steps backwards. He had to twirl the wooden ruler in an
arc before him in order to deflect the remainder of the shockwave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still a bit
weaker than you in close combat.” Keeper Everwood laughed softly,
but his eyes were as cold as ice. “Alas for you, there’s no need
for me to actually fight you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood’s
body blurred as he used [Three Heads, Six Arms]. Each of his six arms
now wielded a wooden ruler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood. I really
don’t want to kill you.” A sigh suddenly rang out in the heavens
as a enormous, dazzling, shining golden palm suddenly ripped through
the skies, smashing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata.” Two of
Keeper Everwood’s hands increased in size as well, and he sent his
massive palms and wooden rulers to block against this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost as soon as
Subhuti had called out to them, Suiren, Tathagata, and Daoist Three
Purities had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren’s wooden staff
was as heavy as the Solar Star or the Lunar Star, and each blow from
it knocked Keeper Everwood stumbling backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata’s palm
contained an entire vast major world inside of it, and those two
hands had long ago reached the level of Chaos treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities’
‘Immrotal Slaying Sword Formation’ was the most offensively
terrifying attack of them all, and Keeper Everwood spent nearly half
of his efforts on defending against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that Shennong
and Fuxi are both within the primordial chaos. It will take them time
to get here.” Suhbuti was frantic. “If it was the Lord of All
Fiends or Daomother Devilhand attacking, there’s no way they could
possibly tie down Three Purities, Tathagata, and Suiren at the same
time. Only Everwood is capable of such a deed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti’s heart was
burning with anxiety. His power primarily lay in his escaping
techniques. Although he was close to the overlord-level in close
combat, he was still considerably weaker than the likes of Three
Purities, Tathagata, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Keeper Everwood,
he was an utter freak. He knew far too many techniques, and when he
put them all on display he was able to simultaneously tie down Three
Purities, Tathagata, and Suiren for a brief period of time. The very
sight of such a feat was terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devilhand, go ahead
and strike. Remember, keep the strike surgical. If we can avoid
starting the Endwar, we need to try and do so,” the Lord of All
Fiends instructed mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should’ve let
me attack long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A violet-robed woman
appeared in the air above the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was adorably short
and slender, with beautiful features, but the strength of her killing
intent was enough to cause the entire Deerchaser world itself to
shudder. Dark stormclouds began to gather, and when Subhuti, Daoist
Three Purities, and Tathagata saw the violet-robed woman, their faces
all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A true fiend amongst
fiends! A true mass-murdering maniac! A devil that had caused even
the Seamless Chaosworld to tremble in terror!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that even when Shadowless and Darklight joined forces together, they
still wouldn’t be able to do anything to Ji Ning. I have no choice
but to let Devilhand to engage as well. I hope that she won’t
expand the scope of things too much.” The Lord of All Fiends felt
some worry in his heart. Ji Ning, when in command of the Envoy of All
Things, truly was much more powerful than they had expected. They had
to send out their overlord-level experts, as otherwise it would be
extremely difficult to capture him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
had no choice. He had to send out Daomother Devilhand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
violet-robed woman had appeared, she stretched out her slender,
ivory-white arms. Her palms sliced through the air, clawing towards
the Envoy-Ning, who was still engaged in a furious battle against
Swordfather Darklight and Daofather Shadowless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Subhuti, Xuan
Yuan, Three Purities, Suiren, and Tathagata? For now, they had all
been completely tied down by Keeper Everwood alone! Although this was
incredibly difficult and taxing for Keeper Everwood, he was able to
endure them for now. Lord Tathagata the Buddha was able to rely on
the formidable power of his golden body to endure a hit while
striking solemnly towards Daomother Devilhand, but she just used one
of her own palms to defend while sending the second clawing towards
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO HARMIN’ MY
JUNIOR APPRENTICE-BROTHER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heaven and Earth
suddenly echoed with this furious bellow, and a murderous aura that
was just as savage as Devilhand’s soared towards the skies. A
monkey-shaped figure had appeared on the distant horizons, and he
delivered a furious, double-handed blow with the staff in his hands.
The enormous staff, glowing with dazzling golden light, smashed
downwards like a thunderbolt from the heavens towards Daomother
Devilhand.

Chapter 27 - Eldest Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unruly monkey!”
Daomother Devilhand glanced sideways at him. She didn’t hold the
King of Flower-Fruit Mountain in any regard, but she still halted her
assault on Ji Ning and instead waved her hand towards the Monkey
King, intending to deal with him first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
stood there in midair, one palm clashing with the oncoming blow from
Lord Tathagata the Buddha, the other smashing towards the Monkey
King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">THUD!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep, dull sound rang
out. It was the sound of the gleaming golden staff colliding with
Daomother Devilhand’s ivory-white hand. Daomother Devilhand’s
hand actually came to a halt. It was actually forced to a halt by
that staff!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daomother
Devilhand’s face changed as she stared at the distant Monkey King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My junior
apprentice-brother has only trained for a few short centuries, but
he’s reached an incredible level of power. It’s been countless
years since the war that ended the Primordial Era. Did you think that
I, ol’ Sun, wouldn’t have made some improvements of my own?”
The Monkey King sped through the air, closing in on her with his
staff in his hands, filled with an unearthly aura of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The monkey has
reached such a level of power as well…our Seamless Gate has been
hiding some of our forces, and now it seems the Nuwa Alliance has
hidden quite a few of theirs as well.” The Lord of All Fiends
secretly sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war that ended the
Primordial Era had occurred far, far too many years ago, after all.
It had been more than half a chaos cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After so many years, it
was entirely possible that a formerly ordinary True God or Daofather
could suddenly reveal the power of a elite Daofather, or perhaps even
an overlord-class Daofather. Both sides would only reveal their final
trump cards in the final instant, at the critical moment which would
determine victory or defeat, life or death. Trump cards that were
left hidden were the most dangerous cards of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Endwar, a
single slip-up or a single unexpected power-up by a major power could
have a huge impact on the outcome of the war. Thus, both sides were
hiding their true power. Even when they were forced to fight, they
would only reveal the powers that the other side already knew about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, although
the monkey was favored by Nuwa, he was still merely a elite
Daofather. But now, he’s close to being an overlord-class
Daofather,” the Lord of All Fiends mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sun Wukong, the King of
Flower-Fruit Mountain. The shadow of Mother Nuwa could be seen behind
him on his path to power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been born from
the only piece of stone that Mother Nuwa had used to repair the
heavens. How could she possibly not pay attention to him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He won his treasures
from the Dragon Palace, apprenticed himself to Subhuti, was tempered
by the Buddhist Sangha, and in the end was provided with the personal
tutelage of Mother Nuwa herself. It could be said that Mother Nuwa
focused more on training this monkey than she had on anyone else.
During the war that ended the Primordial Era, the Seamless Gate had
been quite wary of this monkey, as they were afraid that he might
possess a terrifying amount of power. However, the reality was that
although the monkey was extremely skilled in battle and had many
magical treasures on him, he was fairly weak with regards to his
insights into the Dao, and so was just barely at the level of elite
Daofathers in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, half a chaos cycle
had gone past. The Monkey King had truly transformed, and this was
one of the reasons why Subhuti had summoned him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had summoned
three of his main disciples. The eldest disciple, the woodcutter; the
second disciple, Crazy Ji; the sixth disciple, Sun Wukong. In truth,
Subhuti actually had another Daofather under his command; his twelth
disciple. However, his twelfth disciple was merely an ordinary
Daofather who wasn’t strong enough to get involved in battles at
this level, and so Subhuti did not summon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This monkey is quite
hard to deal with.” Daomother Devilhand immediately gnashed her
teeth after their initial clash. “Before Nuwa left the Three
Realms, she definitely provided this monkey with some assistance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Devilhand was
skilled in battle, she was different from Everwood; Keeper Everwood
was able to simultaneously tie down multiple overlord-class experts
thanks to his defensive prowess, while her skills revolved around
attacks! If she spent enough time and effort, she’d be able to wipe
out the monkey, but time was a rare and limited commodity right now.
The more time passed, the more major powers would make it to this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their target for this
mission was Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the monkey was
formidable, he had long ago become a True God and Daofather; there
was no way he could get involved in the war for karmic luck. Ji Ning
was clearly just an Empyrean God and True Immortal, but he was able
to unleash an utterly unearthly level of power. Now that he had an
Envoy of All Things, he was actually able to unleash a level of power
that was close to that of an overlord-class Daofather. A monster like
this…no matter what, they could not permit him to live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darklight,
Shadowless, stop this monkey for me. Leave Ji Ning to me.”
Daomother Devilhand instantly sent mental instructions to the other
two. She didn’t want to allow the monkey to be able to distract
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Swordfather Darklight had been airborne this entire time. With but a
thought, he caused the black, sword-shaped stream of light under his
control to switch directions, striking towards the Monkey King that
was charging towards them from afar. The Monkey King had no choice
but to use his power to defend against the sword-light. No one would
dare to be overconfident when faced with Swordfather Darklight’s
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Daofather
Shadowless quickly withdrew as well, turning to charge towards the
distant Monkey King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Die.”
Daomother Devilhand was still using one hand to clash against Lord
Tathagata. With her other, she struck out from hundreds of thousands
of kilometers away towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daomother
Devilhand.” Ning felt breathless upon seeing this palm crash down
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was in the Rahu
Formation, he would probably be instantly annihilated. However, using
the Envoy made him much more powerful; more than ten Rahu Formations
would be needed to match its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soleheart stance.”
Ning’s twin swords simultaneously unleashed his most powerful
supreme defensive technique. A pair of sword-light black holes
appeared before Ning. When the terrifying, ivory-white palm lashed
out towards him, it was blocked by the black holes. Daomother
Devilhand could clearly sense that her hand was being repelled by
multiple layers of strange energy that were furiously ablating the
power of her strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daomother
Devilhand frowned. “Leafseizer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her ivory-white hand
suddenly changed, unleashing an even more intricate and terrifying
palm-art. Her forefinger, middle finger, and thumb drew close to each
other, as though she was holding a leaf between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five fingers of her
palm danced their way into Ning’s sword-light black holes. And
then, following a series of exploding sounds, the black hole
vanished, with the fingers latching onto Ning’s Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” Ning
stared in disbelief, his heart filled with shock and dread. Daomother
Devilhand’s seizing technique had been simply too dazzling and
beautiful. It was a technique that was so complicated as to cause one
to feel almost uncontrollably intoxicated upon seeing it. In fact,
the technique was even more complicated than Ning’s sword-arts,
which was why it had been able to break through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps Ji Ning was the
number one expert of the sword in the Three Realms…but in
palm-arts, Daomother Devilhand was number one. Even Lord Tathagata,
who also specialized in palm arts, was slightly weaker than her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand’s
dainty white hands went through multiple different variations; the
‘Leafseizer’ stance, the ‘Flowerpicker’ stance, the ‘Wilted’
stance, and more. These stances all had graceful, refined names, and
Daomother Devilhand’s movements were quite beautiful as well.
However, the power of these techniques caused Ning to feel despair.
He was wielding a pair of swords, but one of them had already been
seized. Twelve stances later, the Envoy-Ning was struck on the waist
by the palm, causing him to uncontrollably fall down to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.”
Daomother Devilhand suddenly produced a Protocosmic spirit-rope in
her hands, and she quickly tossed it around the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trapped inside the
Envoy, Ning just felt a sense of powerlessness and reluctance.
Although he had already fought as hard as he could, he was still a
bit weaker than Daomother Devilhand, a fiend amongst fiends who had
once battled Mother Nuwa to a standstill for a short time during the
war that ended the Primordial Era. She had only been using one hand,
but had been able to capture him after just ten or so stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was able to
reach the fifth stage of swordforce, my sword-arts would become even
more intricate. Combined with my weapon speed surpassing the limits
of the Heavenly Daos…perhaps in that situation, Daomother Devilhand
wouldn’t be able to capture me,” Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of seizing
Ning as quickly as possible, Daomother Devilhand had showed no mercy
whatsoever. She had unleashed more than ten absolutely dazzling
palm-arts with her hand, causing all of the major powers present to
feel shocked. “Daomother Devilhand’s techniques truly have become
even more exquisite since the Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had been
captured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
unwilling to accept this, there was nothing he could say. He had been
simply too careless, and he was simply not strong enough.
Fortunately, he had kept clones outside; even if he died here today,
he would have the chance to return to his full level of power in the
future. Alas, his Ninehorn Lightning Serpent, Darknorth swords, and
other treasures would be lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daomother Devilhand,
please release my junior apprentice-brother.” A chuckling voice
rang out as a skinny old man dressed in tattered clothes emerged from
a spatial whirlpool. He stretched out his hand, and it glittered with
golden light. This was the [Golden Body] technique of the Buddhists,
and his shining golden hand struck out towards Daomother Devilhand,
seeking to stop her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think to stop
me, you crazy monk?” Daomother Devilhand stretched out her own
massive hand, many hundreds of thousands of meters in length, and
seized the Envoy of All Things, completely ignoring Crazy Ji’s
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her ivory-white hand
and Crazy Ji’s golden hand, which looked as skinny as a chicken
claw, collided against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji’s face
changed while Daomother Devilhand revealed a disparaging smile.
However, right at this moment, Daomother Devilhand’s face changed
as well, becoming ugly to behold. She stared in disbelief at the
figure that had just appeared in midair. From that very same spatial
vortex, a woodcutter who wore straw shoes and carried a hatchet over
his shoulders had appeared. He had come here at the same time as
Crazy Ji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji had been the
first to strike, but he had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did the
woodcutter brandish his hatchet, and as soon as he did so, Daomother
Devilhand’s face turned terrible to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Daomother
Devilhand actually voluntarily released Ji Ning, sending her
ivory-white hand upwards to block the hatchet with full force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it be severed.”
The woodcutter spoke in a calm, soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His hatchet seemed
extremely ordinary, but Daomother Devilhand’s incomparably
marvelous palm-arts were actually unable to block it. The hatchet
swished past her defenses, landing on her arm. Slash! Daomother
Devilhand’s arm was immediately severed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After chopping
through Devilhand’s ivory-white arm, it suddenly accelerated past
the speed of light and chopped towards Swordfather Darklight, who had
been controlling his magic treasures to attack from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” Swordfather
Darklight had no idea that this disaster would suddenly descend upon
him from out of nowhere. Although he had noticed the woodcutter
appear, he had been quite confident in Daomother Devilhand’s power.
He hadn’t expected that a single blow from the hatchet would sever
her arm while still carrying enough power to continue to chop towards
him. As for the speed of the hatchet…it was even more terrifying
than Ning’s sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to flee.
But…how could he possibly escape that terrifying hatchet?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash. Swordfather
Darklight’s body was immediately bisected by the hatchet. His soul
and his Jindan were both annihilated, and the two halves of his
corpse fell down from the skies, landing on the ground and
splattering blood everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daofather who had
reached the fifth stage of swordforce and who was skilled in
assassinations..had died, just like that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
had turned silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
Lord Tathagata, and Suiren had come to a halt as well. Keeper
Everwood had also come to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s gaze was
turned towards the hatchet-wielding woodcutter. The woodcutter looked
very ordinary, and he was dressed very plainly and simply…but just
now, that ‘ordinary’ hatchet had delivered a blow that had
stunned all of the overlord-class major powers present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, there
had been another figure who had similarly stunned them with his
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Houyi with his
arrows!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And today, this
woodcutter had stunned them with his hatchet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Crazy Ji was rescuing the Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
retracted her treasures, her arm once more growing out and healing.
She stared intently at the woodcutter, completely ignoring Ji Ning.
She did not even think about trying to capture him again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi. Is that you?”
Daomother Devilhand’s voice was crisp and pleasing to the ear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s me.” The
woodcutter’s reply was very calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire imperial
palace had turned deathly silent. After a long period of silence…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies above the
imperial palace repeatedly exploded as more and more major powers
descended. It was the other major powers of the Nuwa Alliance, who
had all hastened here to help out. They included Exalted Celestial
Thundergod, Exalted Celestial Carefree, Buddha Amitabha, Buddha
Maitreya, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this fight
took time to describe, it had actually occurred at high speed. Only
brief moments had passed between Ji Ning’s true body being killed,
his Primaltwin appearing within the Envoy, the Envoy being captured,
and Crazy Ji and the woodcutter intervening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A very short period of
time had passed…but now, all the major powers were completely
focused on the woodcutter rather than Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been so many
years. Sorry for the trouble, Master.” The woodcutter looked
towards Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…I imagine
Three Purities, Tathagata, and the others would’ve fought over the
chance to accept Houyi as a disciple.” Subhuti laughed merrily.
“Wonderful. You’ve finally decided to come out. I had thought
that you wouldn’t come out this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My junior
apprentice-brother was very nearly killed. How much longer could I
possibly wait?” The woodcutter looked at the distant, unnerved
figures of Daomother Devilhand and Keeper Everwood. “As I see
it…right now, our priority should be having a nice discussion with
you of the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed time
for a chat.” A red-robed, azure-haired figure appeared in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend.” The
woodcutter looked towards the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large number of major
powers had appeared in the air above the imperial palace, but none of
them dared to make a sound; all of them were strictly conversing
through quiet mental messages to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, still
within the Envoy of All Things, he raised his head to stare at the
midair woodcutter, astonishment in his heart. “Eldest disciple?
Woodcutter? Houyi?”
</P>

Chapter 28 - Negotiations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eldest disciple of
their league, the low-key woodcutter who always spent his time
chopping down trees at Mount Innerheart…was actually Houyi?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning had first
started to train in [Houyi’s Archery], the woodcutter had walked
past him a few times, hatchet over his shoulders. He had even given
Ning a few critical words of enlightenment when Ning was at a
bottleneck. Ning hadn’t thought much of it back then, as he thought
it was normal for someone as powerful as the eldest
apprentice-brother to be able to provide him with some guidance. Who
would’ve thought that the man was actually the creator of [Houyi’s
Archery], Houyi himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Crazy Ji fanned himself, smiling as he called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” A streak of light flew towards him from far
away, landing on the ground next to him. It was the Monkey King,
dressed in dazzling golden armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second
apprentice-brother. Sixth apprentice-brother.” Ning hurriedly
called out to the two of them. As he did so, he couldn’t help but
take a close look at his sixth apprentice-brother. There were many
legends of the Primordial Era that circulated amongst the nations of
Earth. Although some of them weren’t quite accurate, his sixth
apprentice-brother Sun Wukong was a tremendously famous figure on
Earth. But of course, by now Ning had met with many major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, Daoist
Three Purities, Patriarch Subhuti, Lord Tathagata the Buddha…he had
met them all. Thus, Ning was quite calm when meeting with his sixth
apprentice-brother for the first time. He was just a bit curious
about the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh…I didn’t
expect my eldest apprentice-brother to actually be Houyi.” Sun
Wukong chortled merrily. “When I first went to apprentice myself to
Master, he actually gave me directions. I had thought him to be an
ordinary woodcutter. Only later did I realize that he was actually
our eldest apprentice-brother! Even back then, I mumbled to ourself
that he was really good at hiding his abilities…but only today do I
know he is actually the great divinity Houyi of the Primordial Era.
His level of subterfuge is quite extraordinary!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi had become famous
very, very early on. When he had slain the Golden Crows, Sun Wukong
hadn’t even been born into the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I became apprenticed
to Master very early on, but even I didn’t know of his true
history.” Crazy Ji chortled merrily, “When I became apprenticed
to Master, our eldest apprentice-brother was already there by his
side. However, even back then he spent his days as a woodcutter
chopping trees. Honestly, I was quite puzzled back then; he was
clearly Master’s disciple, but why was it that I never saw him
asking Master for guidance? But Master told me that our eldest
apprentice-brother already had the power of a True God and Daofather,
and that there was no way to ‘teach’ him; he needed to gain his
own insights. Thus, I didn’t think too much on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that long
ago, because of Chang’e, our eldest apprentice-brother actually
slaughtered a path to the Lunar Star, planning to chop down the
osmanthus tree on the Lunar Star. However, whenever he struck at the
tree, it would immediately reheal. No matter what he did, he couldn’t
chop the tree down. At Mount Innerheart, our eldest
apprentice-brother spends all his days chopping down trees…is it
because he plans to once more pay a visit to the Moon Palace of the
Lunar Star?” The Monkey King lowered his voice and even went so far
as to block out sound from the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damned monkey, do
you think that our eldest apprentice-brother’s affairs are
something for you to pry into?” Crazy Ji hurriedly reprimanded him.
“You can’t talk about this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother can’t hear me. I’d only ever discuss it behind
his back.” Sun Wukong blinked a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ji Ning knew that
the affair between Houyi and Chang’e had been a scarring one for
Houyi! Picking at another’s scars and scabs was not a good idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Buddha,
Three Purities, and the others are negotiating with those of the
Seamless Chaosworld. Let’s take a break for now.” Crazy Ji gave
Sun Wukong a hard stare. “Don’t cause trouble, you monkey. If you
piss off our eldest apprentice-brother, none of us would be able to
save you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The Monkey
King shivered slightly, nodding repeatedly. “During the Primordial
Era, he roamed the world with his archery skills. Now, even his
hatchet skills have become so incredibly powerful. Daomother
Devilhand is an awe-inspiringly famous figure on the level of the
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism, but our eldest apprentice-brother was
actually able to sever her arm with a single blow of his hatchet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was because
Daomother Devilhand was too proud and overconfident,” Crazy Ji
said. “Our eldest apprentice-brother was incredibly powerful even
during the Primordial Era; even the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism
were forced to use all their might when facing him. For Daomother
Devilhand to actually try to face him with a single arm…hmph, it
would’ve been shocking if she didn’t suffer for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. He was
about to put away the Envoy of All Things, but he suddenly then
thought of how Daomother Devilhand had struck him with a blow,
causing him to uncontrollably fall to the ground. Ning took a careful
look at the Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed. “What’s this?” Ning immediately noticed that the
energy core of the Envoy, located at its waist, had actually cracked
open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly tried to
use the Envoy’s power, only to discover that it was now completely
inoperable. It was as though the cracks here had severed the Envoy’s
ability to send energy around its body. The Envoy had suddenly become
useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been made
useless? How?!” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy of All
Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">B-but…this was the
most powerful tool he had at his disposal! When using it, he would be
able to unleash a level of power close to that of the overlord
Daofathers, on the same level as Subhuti and Daofather Shadowless.
Just like that, the Envoy had suddenly been rendered useless?! It
must be understood that even full-force blows from the leaders of
Buddhism and Daoism would barely be able to damage the thing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand had
landed a gentle blow on the Envoy’s waist…and just like that, the
Envoy had been ruined? Still, it had been quite strange; a single
blow had been all it took to cause the Envoy-Ning to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second
apprentice-brother, sixth apprentice-brother.” Ning said in a low
voice, “The Envoy of All Things has been ruined.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Crazy Ji
and the Monkey King were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded solemnly.
“It should’ve been ruined by Daomother Devilhand. I don’t know
how she accomplished it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Monkey King gnashed
his teeth. As for Crazy Ji, he frowned and said in a soft voice,
“Mm…this Envoy golem was created by the Seamless Gate. They
probably put in certain mechanisms to prevent us from being able to
take them over, such as a self-destruct mechanism that would cripple
it. However, activating such mechanisms probably isn’t easy. During
the war for karmic luck, your opponents have all been Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals; they wouldn’t have the ability to ruin your
Envoy. Daomother Devilhand, however, is an overlord-class major
power. Given that she knows exactly how the Envoy is structurally
composed and where its weaknesses are, it makes sense that she would
be able to easily destroy it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I heard that
when the Lord of All Things died, all of his Envoys were rendered
completely inoperable as well.” The Monkey King nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In contrast, the
Envoys of the Seamless Gate can only be destroyed by the personal
touch of someone like Daomother Devilhand. Comparatively speaking,
they still aren’t a match for the Envoys of the Lord of All
Things,” Crazy Ji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji suddenly
added, “Report this to Master right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, tell Master
right away,” the Monkey King agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the most supreme
figures took part in the negotiations between the Nuwa Alliance and
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly trickled
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other major powers
continued to wait quietly at the Deerchaser world for the results of
their negotiations. Ji Ning, Crazy Ji, the Monkey King, and the other
members of the Mount Innerheart League all waited patiently as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long amount of time
passed. The skies were slowly beginning to turn bright. Only now did
the major powers of the Seamless Gate leave the Deerchaser world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master. Eldest
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Crazy Ji, and
the Monkey King had been seated, but now all three of them hurriedly
rose to their feet. Patriarch Subhuti and Houyi were walking
shoulder-to-shoulder towards their residence from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go,
Master?” The Monkey King asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning suffered a heavy loss. Our Nuwa Alliance
as a whole didn’t do that badly,” Patriarch Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For me to suffer a
loss is nothing. Our side gaining an advantage in this war is what
really matters,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at Ning.
“Myself, Houyi, and the other major powers discussed this in
secret. Our main concern is that for the Seamless Gate to suddenly
act against you in such a manner, they must have made many careful
preparations for the possible consequences. They are prepared, but we
are not…and we currently hold the upper hand in the war for karmic
luck. Thus, although we were infuriated, we still would not choose to
rashly launch the Endwar right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi nodded as well.
“But of course, if the Seamless Gate insists on starting the
Endwar, then so be it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearly, your eldest
apprentice-brother’s sudden appearance and power has caught them
rather off-guard,” Subhuti said. “The negotiations ended up being
fairly beneficial for our Nuwa Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What were the
results?” The Monkey King asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
had only one request. Ji Ning is not permitted to take part in the
war for karmic luck,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WHAT?! But that’s…!”
The Monkey King was instantly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti continued to
talk. “We accepted. Our request…was that not a single one of the
Seamless Gate’s Envoys are to be permitted to take part in the war
for karmic luck either. Although the Seamless Gate has lost one of
them, they still have nine more! If all of them were activated, even
my disciple Ji Ning would have to clone himself several times over to
deal with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. It was true. He needed time to deal with even a single Envoy,
to first destabilize it and then knock it to the ground. If there
were two Envoys working together, there would be nothing Ning could
do against him. The other seven Envoys would be free to fight and
kill as they pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning suffered a
heavy loss, after all; they had to pay a price for what they did. As
for Swordfather Darklight, he died for nothing; his death wasn’t
taken into account.” Subhuti looked towards Ning. “Disciple,
there’s no way you can take part in the rest of the war for karmic
luck, but none of their Envoys will be allowed to take part as well.
You really have accomplished something tremendous for our side. If
there’s anything you need, just tell me.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ji Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whatever you need,
whatever you are lacking for…just speak.” Subhuti continued,
“Three Purities, Tathagata, and the others all feel that we owe
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had gained many
legacies from World God Northrest, and he had also acquired the
treasures of the many prisoners of Prisonworld 17. He really didn’t
need to ask these major powers for anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Houyi looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
this plainly dressed man, the legendary Houyi. The great divinity
still looked as though he was nothing but an ordinary mortal, but
Ning felt true admiration towards him. Long ago, Houyi had dominated
the Three Realms through archery! But today, he had actually been
able to injure Daomother Devilhand when using his hatchet. How
powerful would he be when using his arrows? How truly unfathomable!
Houyi’s sudden appearance and intervention had stunned everyone.
They weren’t just stunned at the fact that he was Houyi; they were
mainly stunned that the number one divine archer of the Three Realms,
Houyi, was actually so terrifying when wielding a hatchet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, the war
for karmic luck will only have a certain degree of effect on the
final Endwar,” Houyi said. “In the end, winning the Endwar will
primarily be dependent on the respective major powers on each side!
The more powerful one is, the more of an impact one will make on the
battlefield. The gain or loss of an overlord-class Daofather will
have an enormous impact on the battlefield…and of course, if a
Pangu-level expert appears, that person will be able to completely
dominate all comers. In that scenario, a war for karmic luck would be
completely useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…focus calmly
on your training.” Houyi looked at Ning. “Train hard. If there’s
no need for you to take part in the war for karmic luck, then you
might as well focus on your training. In the end, the most important
affair of all is the Endwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
agreed with this analysis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t opposed
to not being able to take part in the Endwar. What he truly wished
for was the destruction of the Seamless Gate, and his deepest desire
was to personally kill the Godking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, I really
am not happy that the Envoys are not going to be able to take part in
the world for karmic luck.” Daomother Devilhand’s slender face
was as cold as ice, and her eyes were filled with murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It might be a good
thing that the Envoys will not take part.” The nearby Keeper
Everwood explained, “Although Ji Ning’s true body has been
destroyed, he still has his Primaltwin. If he uses his Primaltwin to
control the Rahu Formation, he has the power to kidnap yet another
Envoy. He’ll be strong enough to be close to matching
overlord-class major powers. That’ll make him equivalent to a host
of Envoys.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Letting him capture
an Envoy is one thing. Would we really let him capture a second?”
Daomother Devilhand laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning isn’t
alone; he has the entire army of the Nuwa Alliance supporting him.
There are no absolute certainties in war.” Keeper Everwood shook
his head. “And this time, our side was in the wrong to begin with.
The furious Nuwa Alliance might very well have actually launched the
Endwar. You saw Houyi’s power for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was overconfident.
I had no idea he was Houyi. If I knew he was Houyi, do you think I
would’ve fought against him with just one hand?” Daomother
Devilhand shook her head. “If we both fought at full strength, it’s
not certain who would win and who would lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus far, the Lord of
All Fiends had remained silent. Now, however, he made a calm comment:
“But Houyi was using a hatchet. What if he was using his Houyi
Godbow?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi is clearly far
more powerful than he was during the Primordial Era; even I can
vaguely sense danger emanating from him.” The Lord of All Fiends
shook his head. “The true purpose of building the Envoys is to have
Daofathers command them and use them against the enemy overlord-class
powers. If they can’t be used in the war for the karmic luck, then
that is that. It’s almost worth it just to ensure that Ji Ning
cannot participate either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right; did you ruin
that Envoy he had?” The Lord of All Fiends asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did.” Daomother
Devilhand nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been multiple
layers to their plans. Ruining the Envoy was one of them. If one of
them was to destroy a critical part of the golem, Grandmaster
Blackheaven would be able to easily fix the damage once they brought
it back. But since the Nuwa Alliance lacked the critical
formation-diagram, there was no way whatsoever for them to repair it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The Lord of
All Fiends nodded. “Ji Ning cannot participate in the war for
karmic luck; he’ll only be able to participate in the Endwar.
Without the Envoy, he’s now much less of a threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Endwar
comes, Ji Ning won’t amount to much,” Daomother Devilhand agreed
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His true body has
been destroyed, while his Primaltwin is only a Ki Refiner,” Keeper
Everwood said. “There is no way a pure Ki Refiner can reach the
overlord class of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. In all the
Three Realms, be it in the Nuwa Alliance or the Seamless Gate, the
most supreme figures were not merely Ki Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Purities,
Tathagata, Fuxi; they were born True Gods of Primordial Chaos, but
gave up their bodies when they sent themselves into the cycles of
reincarnation. However, even in their later lives they were dual
refiners, training as Fiendgods and as Ki Refiners! Shennong and
Suiren both had incredibly powerful divine bodies, while even Subhuti
and Old Man Yuan were born as True Gods of Primordial Chaos! As for
the Seamless Gate’s side, Daomother Devilhand, the Lord of All
Fiends, and Keeper Everwood all specialized in close combat; all
three of them trained as both Ki Refiners and as Fiendgod Body
Refiners!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Theoretically, a pure
Ki Refiner could also reach the overlord level if they reached a
sufficiently high level of insight into the Dao. However, to date the
Three Realms had never produced anyone who could reach such heights
as a pure Ki Refiner. Moreover, attempting to reach that level of
power purely through cultivating in the Dao would take time. Ji Ning
had yet to master even a single Heavenly Dao; he was far, far away
from becoming an overlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the Seamless Gate
believed Ning to be much less of a threat with his true body gone.
This made quite logical sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he only has a
Primaltwin, he’s much less dangerous now. He’s only been training
for so many years; his weakness is quite apparent.” Keeper Everwood
shook his head. “This Ji Ning truly is a monstrously talented
figure. If he was given another hundred thousand years, he probably
would become an extremely dangerous figure. Unfortunately for him, he
won’t have enough time to train…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still feel as
though giving up our plans to have Envoys take part in the war for
karmic luck will have an excessively large impact.” Daomother
Devilhand frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need to
discuss this matter any longer,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
“Right - Everwood, how are your negotiations with Old Man Yuan
coming along?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wants access to
our Seamless Gate’s three great secret manuals.” Keeper Everwood
let out a sigh. “He wants all three, not a single one less. Only if
we give him all three would he be willing to join us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three great
secret manuals? And all three of them?” Daomother Devilhand let out
a cold laugh. “Old Man Yuan really is quite ambitious. Even I have
merely studied two of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, when
the Seamless Chaosworld was still intact, when the Lord of the
Demonheart had been roving the primordial chaos he had accidentally
discovered three incomparably profound secret manuals. These manuals
were the [Seven Hearts], [Coiling River], and [Shadowless]. These
became the most important and most profound techniques techniques
which the Lord of the Demonheart used, and they were one of the most
important reasons why he was able to unify the entire Seamless
Chaosworld in such a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to draw more
allies to his side, Lord Demonheart would occasionally bestow the
techniques upon others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, [Seven
Hearts] was something which Lord Demonheart kept for himself; he was
only willing to teach the [Coiling River] and [Shadowless] to the
others. However, after the Lord of All Fiends rescued the entire
Seamless Gate after they lost the war, Lord Demonheart had decided to
bestow [Seven Hearts] upon the Lord of All Fiends, even though Lord
Demonheart himself had already become one with the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words, the
only people in the entire Seamless Gate who had studied all three of
those secret manuals were Lord Demonheart and the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Seven Hearts]
is a heartforce technique,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
“Truthfully speaking, most major powers can’t even make use of
it. One has to reach the fifth level of heartforce before one can
master this technique. In truth, it’s not impossible for us to
impart it to Old Man Yuan. His faction has quite a few major powers,
after all, and they are quite powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Keeper
Everwood and Daomother Devilhand both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
members of Old Man Yuan’s faction were known as the Four Ancestors
of the River Source! They also had other major powers within their
faction as well. Although Old Man Yuan himself had already revealed
himself to be close to the overlord level of power, who knew if he
was hiding his true strength?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, both sides wished
to draw this incredibly powerful faction into their ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My worry is that
once we give him the three secret manuals, he’ll then decide to
join the Nuwa Alliance and hand them over,” the Lord of All Fiends
said. “I heard that alien Outsiders have a way to set down
something known as a ‘lifeblood oath’, but none of us have any
idea as to how that is done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go speak with
him a bit further.” Keeper Everwood frowned. “We have to draw Old
Man Yuan into our orbit. If he joins us, the Nuwa Alliance will have
lost one of its original members. This will represent a significant
shift in the balance of power. We have to recruit him. Also -
Windfiend, I’ll leave the other matters in your hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, leave the
matters in the primordial chaos to me.” The Lord of All Fiends
nodded. “It has been more than half a chaos cycle since the war
that ended the Primordial Era. Although we’ve hidden much of our
power, the Nuwa Alliance is not to be underestimated. Don’t forget
that Nuwa had reached the World God level of power. It’s hard to
predict what she left behind her for her alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were
extremely cautious. The war for karmic luck was just one element out
of many that would impact the Endwar. However, both sides were doing
everything they could to increase their chances of winning…because
when the Endwar erupted, either your side would die or my side would
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the endless
primordial chaos. Inside a frozen star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This star was fairly
unremarkable, and it didn’t even have a name assigned to it. It
was, however, the place where Ning had placed Prisonworld 17.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had already
been forgotten by the Seamless Gate, having been deemed to no longer
be a threat. And yet, at this moment, he quietly emerged from the
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stood there within the deep crevice, staring at the endless glacial
ice before him. “In the coming days, unless something major
happens, I’ll just calmly spend my time in the prisonworld, working
on improving my power as best as I can.”
</P>

Chapter 30 - Recovering
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was all by
himself within the deep crevice, but his heartforce had been spread
out to cover the entire frozen star. It was like a star-sized lake,
and layers of ripples emanated out from it, sweeping through every
part of the star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a little trick
for using heartforce to scout, and it was one of the many techniques
World God Northrest had left behind. Although it was just a little
trick, this heartforce scouting technique ensured that none of the
major powers of the Three Realms would be able to follow him without
him sensing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When roaming the
primordial chaos, it was important to know many auxiliary techniques,
such as aura-suppressing techniques, heartforce scouting techniques,
disguising techniques, heartforce soul-locking techniques…these
minor auxiliary techniques wouldn’t allow him to grow more
powerful, but they greatly increased his survivability. Without them,
it would be easy to fall and perish when wandering the primordial
chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These auxiliary
techniques seemed unremarkable, but in truth they were amongst the
most important and most elite of techniques which World God Northrest
had left behind. Not even the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals of
the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea would have the chance to learn these
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
after I revealed such incredible power, the Seamless Gate would be
even more wary of me and perhaps even trail me. I actually took an
incredibly roundabout way to get her…but now, it seems, they no
longer view me as being a threat at all.” The black-robed Ning let
out a mental sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to visiting this
frozen star, he had paid a visit to the Crescent world, so as to
impede the Seamless Gate from following him. But alas, it was
pointless; the Seamless Gate hadn’t even been tracking him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense.
Since I can no longer take part in the war for karmic luck, I am now
much less of a threat to them than I was before. As far as the major
powers are concerned, without the Envoy I am far too weak for them to
be worried about!” The black-robed Ning shook his head, then
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
seated in the lotus position, and in front of him was a great
cauldron that glowed with faint light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the Five
Elements Cauldron. The Five Elements Cauldron no longer looked as
dirty and ragged as it had before; clearly, it was now revealing its
true luster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There he is.” The
white-robed youth raised his head to look over as the black-robed
Ning flew towards him from far away. When the black-robed Ning
landed, a black lightning serpent instantly appeared out of nowhere,
quickly scurrying into the white-robed youth’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true bodies
were all lightning-attribute bodies, which was why they were all
capable of controlling the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent with ease. The
Primaltwin was very powerful but had no way of controlling the
serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I used up a
veritable sea of treasures, melting down almost all the items I
acquired from this prisonworld for Five Elements essence. Who
would’ve thought that I would be unable to repair even the surface
appearance of Violetjewel?” The black-robed Ning looked at the
ancient stone platform. Atop the stone platform was the completely
blood-colored sword Violetjewel, the body of the sword still covered
with countless cracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Violetjewel
absorbed enough Five Elements essence for its surface layer to be
repaired, it would be possible for Ning to carry it into battle, and
it would be far more powerful than a Chaos weapon. If Ning was able
to acquire enough essence to completely and truly repair it, it would
possess enough power to intoxicate even Chaos Immortals and World
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel as though
only a fifth of the surface layer has been repaired.” Ning secretly
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been more
than a thousand Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals in the
prisonworld, and Ning had already extorted all of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had also acquired
quite a few treasures from True Gods and True Immortals as well.
Aside from a tiny number of treasures that he kept for himself, he
had melted down all the rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this isn’t to
forge or reforge Violetjewel, it’s just to repair the superficial,
surface damage. For even the surface layer to require so much Five
Elements essence…if I had instead used the essence to upgrade my
Goldstar Beads of the Heavens, some of them probably would’ve been
upgraded to Chaos treasures by now,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five Elements essence
was primarily used to repair treasures, but they would also be used
to enhance and upgrade certain special treasures. Some treasures had
excellent foundations and were thus able to absorb Five Elements
essence and be upgraded by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldstar Beads of
the Heavens were no ordinary treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t like the
Protocosmic spirit-treasures which were naturally born from Heaven
and Earth after Pangu established the world. Instead, they were
formed in the primordial chaos from the leftover essence of enormous
chaos stars that had reached the ends of their lives, with the
essence having condensed into gems. They had just so happened to be
floating the area when Pangu had established the world, and thus had
accidentally been drawn into the world and become transformed into
Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gems like them were
actually icredibly valuable! When smaller chaos stars died they
generally didn’t have enough leftover essence for gems to be
crystallized. Only larger chaos stars were able to give birth to
these gems. Every single gem could be used as a valuable ingredient
and would generally be used to forge a Chaos treasure. Because they
ended up floating into the newly-established Pangu Chaosworld, they
ended up being titled the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens and used to
smash people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this was truly a
waste!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those Protocosmic
spirit-treasures that were born from the Pangu Chaosworld itself
didn’t have much potential, but the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens
had tremendous potential. They were capable of withstanding
reinforcement from Five Treasures essence and being upgraded to
become Chaos treasures. Alas, the amount of essence needed to upgrade
all of those 3600 beads to become Chaos treasures…Ning knew it to
be nothing more than a pipe dream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A set of 3600 Chaos
treasures?” Ning secretly shook his head. Not all the treasures of
the entire prisonworld combined might be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Elements
Cauldron was placed right next to the white-robed Ning, who remained
seated in the lotus position, a bottle of chaos nectar before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One drop of precious
Chaos nectar after another was absorbed into the white-robed youth’s
body, and then a series of phantom, ghostly figures flew out of him.
When each phantom landed on the ground, it solidified into yet
another white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on,
and one white-robed youth after another was materialized. Ning’s
bodies were still at merely the second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods]; he had relied on the [One True Body] technique to merge
seventeen of those bodies together. Now, he once more replicated his
seventeen destroyed bodies by using the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] to
absorb chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, [Icefire Jindan
Smelting].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the seventeen
white-robed youths had a globe of Ninefire Lava and Iceheart Pith
floating before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stood off to one side, staring at the Ninefire Lava and the Iceheart
Pith. He secretly sighed to himself, “I still have quite a bit of
Ninefire Lava, but there’s not much Iceheart Pith left. After this,
I’ll only have around fifty thousand kilograms of Iceheart Pith
left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His main body had been
destroyed. Thanks to chaos nectar, Iceheart Pith, and Ninefire Lava,
he was able to completely heal himself in a single short month!
However, if the main body was destroyed yet again…he didn’t have
enough Iceheart Pith, nor did he have much chaos nectar left. If he
wanted to recover from it a second time, he would probably need an
extremely long period of time to do so. The same had been true of
Youngflame Freak in the past; if too many of his bodies died, he
would need an extremely long period of time to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A month later. The
seventeen white-robed youths had all seen their golden pellet Jindans
upgraded, and they now once more used the [One True Body] technique
to merge together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back to full
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of a murderous
look flashed through the white-robed Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would never forget
the sight of the Godking annihilating Yu Wei’s soul. That sight
would probably haunt him for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking. I’m not
strong enough yet, so just keep waiting for now. I’ll be back.”
Ning’s heart was filled with the utmost resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Swoosh. The white-robed youth collected the black-robed Ning, then
flew outwards, leaving behind just a single clone to continue using
the Five Elements Cauldron. Ning would use this clone to as he had in
the past, to serve as a base template for slowly rebuilding his other
bodies if his main body was destroyed. Thus, Ning absolutely would
not permit this body to be merged with the others through the [One
True Body] technique. If he did that and then died, his death would
be a true death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a
while, the white-robed Ning’s speed began to lessen. A series of
stone steles lay in the grasslands before him, like monoliths that
jutted out from the plains. These stone steles surrounded an
unspeakably beautiful jade palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was gravely
wounded, which was a disaster, but the chance to fight against
Swordfather Darklight, Daofather Shadowless, and Daomother Devilhand
was a blessing,” Ning mused to himself. Although he was able to
battle against True Gods and True Immortals in the prisonworld, the
ones that were imprisoned here generally had yet to master any of the
Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they did, they would
become Ancestral Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because they hadn’t been able to master a Heavenly Dao that these
True Gods and True Immortals, in terms of raw power, were generally
just comparable to ordinary Daofathers. Occcasionally, a few
possessed divine abilities that allowed them to release the power of
a elite Daofather, but the likes of Swordfather Darklight and
Daofather Shadowless were experts even amongst their elite Daofather
peers. As for Daomother Devilhand, she was an overlord-class figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Daofathers
of the Three Realms had relatively weaker foundations than the
denizens of Pangaea, in terms of insights into the Dao, they were far
superior. In terms of insights into the Dao, only a minority of the
Ancestral Immortals and Elder Gods who were imprisoned in Prisonworld
17 were a match for the likes of Daomother Devilhand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand’s
palm-arts were reputed to be number one in all the Three Realms,
superior to even that of Lord Tathagata the Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning fought
against her, he had naturally been considerably enlightened and
stimulated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to carefully
think over what I saw and quietly ponder it all. Perhaps I’ll be
able to make use of this setback to reach the fifth stage of
swordforce.” After Ning entered the jade shrine, he sat down on a
prayer mat woven from a type of Chaos treasure known as Winterheart
Grass. His heart and soul quickly grew calm, and he began to engage
in silent meditation and reflection. He thought back through all the
things he had seen when battling against Swordfather Darklight,
Daofather Shadowless, and Daomother Devilhand.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Shadowless,
in terms of power, was slightly superior to Swordfather Darklight,
but that was primarily because of his divine abilities. In terms of
raw technique and skill, Swordfather Darklight was actually superior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts were the
strongest sword-arts the Seamless Gate had, and his assassination
techniques were second to none. Alas…he had died under Houyi’s
hatchet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning pondered over
Swordfather Darklight’s sword-arts in close detail, replaying every
single sword-stroke in his mind and learning much from them.
Daomother Devilhand’s palm-arts…although there was no way for
Ning to understand them, he had been able to see some of the
underlying mysteries behind them. As quietly reflected on them now,
he was able to discover more and more of their secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Ning opened
his eyes, nine days had gone past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
left the jade shrine. With a wave of his finger, he materialized a
longsword before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Sword-light flickered in a light, graceful manner. It was
occasionally sharp and valiant, occasionally strange and mysterious,
and occasionally brutal and dominating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can clearly sense
that I’m just a tiny step away…but why is it that I’m just not
able to break through?” Ning shook his head, murmuring to himself.
He had thought that the insights he had gained from this fight would
allow him to reach the fifth stage of swordforce. Daomother Devilhand
was an overlord-class expert, after all, and she had mastered four of
the Heavenly Daos of the Seamless Chaosworld: Earth, Fire, Water,
Wind. A chance to face her in a life-and-death battle was a rare
opportunity indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had been
meditating, he could sense that his improvements had been quite
remarkable. And yet, he was still unable to reach the fifth stage of
swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To advance from the
fourth stage of swordforce to the fifth stage really is
extraordinarily difficult.” Ning had a sudden thought, and he
immediately waved his hand. Boom! Boom! Boom! One enormous goldstar
bead after another came crashing down upon the flat plains, falling
down around the scattered stone steles. After all 3600 goldstar beads
landed, the Nine Chaos Seals began to manifest atop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there,
carefully staring at the giant goldstar beads and the stone steles
covered in sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone steles had
been left behind by World God Northrest for his successors. As for
the Nine Chaos Seals of the goldstar beads, they were even more
arcane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent half a day
staring at them. Then, Ning shook his head. “Come back.” He waved
his hand, instantly causing the jade shrine, the ninety-eight stone
steles, and 3600 goldstar beads to all be collected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end,
life-and-death battles are what truly matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The white-robed
Ning instantly transformed into a lightning serpent, speeding off
into the distance at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” A skinny,
short man with horns on his forehead was seated in the lotus position
in the desert. He raised his golden eyes, staring intently at Ning.
He laughed coldly, “Overseer, why have you come again? Last time,
you used a pile of Protocosmic spirit-treasures to threaten me. What
are you planning to do this time? Try everything you have. You want
me to submit to you, a trifling True Immortal? You are absolutely
dreaming! You-…eh? This time, you’ve completely suppressed and
withdrawn your aura to the point where even I cannot sense it. Did
the other True Gods and True Immortals berate you so much that you
ended up deciding to hide that puny little aura of yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
stared at the skinny, short man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
conducting more soulscours and acquiring more Protocosmic
spirit-treasures, Ning had taken all of his spoils of war and used
them to threaten all of the True Gods and True Immortals of the
prisonworld, one at a time. All of those True Gods and True Immortals
understood that if they continued to fight against Ning, they would
eventually die. When they saw how many Protocosmic spirit-treasures
Ning had, they knew that it was true that some True Gods and True
Immortals had eventually lowered their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, only about
twenty True Gods and True Immortals in the entire prisonworld had
been willing to surrender without even fighting back. The others
would not lower their heads so easily! Only when they truly sensed
death impending would they be willing to bow their heads towards
Jindan, a puny True Immortal with a third-tier Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny?” Ning’s
aura suddenly soared to the heavens, so powerful as to cause the
smirking man’s face to instantly change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” The
skinny man stared at Ning in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s current aura
was no weaker than his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have a fight with
me.” Ning wielded a Darknorth sword in each hand, and with a swish
he transformed into a streak of light that flew towards the skinny
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually dares to
fight me in close combat?” The skinny man licked his lips.
“Although he’s grown much more powerful, that’s only in terms
of the Immortal energy in his body. His divine body shouldn’t be as
strong as mine yet. Since he dares to fight me in close combat…fine.
To be able to kill an Overseer before dying will be worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny man’s
heart was filled with a desire to do battle. A pair of enormous axes
appeared in his hands, and his body rapidly began to increase in size
as well. He had been incredibly skinny, all skin and bones, but now
his muscles rapidly began to grow out. His emaciated body instantly
became tall and strong, and his golden eyes became filled with a
dominating, savage aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twin axes in his hands,
he let out a wild laugh. “Since you seek death, let me send you on
your way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly
collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! The True God
actually stumbled two steps back. Clutching at his axes, he stared in
absolute shock at Ning, who had been knocked flying backwards as
well. He said disbelievingly, “You’ve surpassed the limits of the
Heavenly Daos? Y-your sword arts…where did you learn them from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single technique
that surpassed the Heavenly Daos in some way was incomparably
priceless. Even he hadn’t had the chance to learn one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had very
nearly been chopped in half by Ning’s sword-strike. Fortunately,
his reaction speed was fast and his axe was large, allowing him to
use it almost like a shield. This was the reason why he had been able
to block that strange, bizarre sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not
something for the likes of you to find out about.” Ning narrowed
his eyes, staring at his foe. How formidable! Although his foe’s
axe-arts were ordinary, he was still a True God. Ning was just a
half-step True God! In power, speed, and every other aspect, he was
on a slightly lower level. The only reason why he could even pose a
threat was because he had the number one sword-arts of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…that’s what
made it fun!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when he was under
enough pressure in a true life-and-death battle would he be able to
truly temper his sword-arts. Although battling against the prisoners
of the prisonworld did carry some degree of risk, the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique ensured that he’d have a very good
chance of successfully escaping any dangerous situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, in
similar a battle in the outside world, he would be in much more
danger than he was here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful. Don’t
end up letting yourself be killed by me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You? Even
though you have a sword-art that surpasses the Heavenly Daos, you
aren’t a match for me.” This True God prisoner was quite proud
and arrogant. His foe was clearly not a True God. How could he
possibly lose?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two clashed against
each other repeatedly in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of close
combat was far more dangerous than a fight in which both sides used
magic treasures to attack from afar. In addition, after having being
put at a disadvantage in their first clash, the True God prisoner had
become much more wary of Ning’s sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword showed
absolutely no mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God prisoner
wanted to seize this opportunity to annihilate Ji Ning, the current
Overseer. Perhaps in Ning’s relics, he would be able to find the
technique which had allowed Ning to surpass the limits of the
Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of battle…it
was exactly what Ning needed right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Swish! Slash!
Ning’s sword-light and the True God’s axe clashed again and again
against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their battle grew
longer and longer. One hour. Two hours. What truly astonished the
True God prisoners was…he could vaguely sense that this Overseer’s
sword-arts were actually slowly rising in power. What he didn’t
realize was that ever since Ning had left Undermoon Lake, he had had
very few chances to engage in true life-and-death battles; the only
real fight he had thus far was against Daomother Devilhand and the
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his capture of
the Envoy, that was an act of utter domination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fight against the
True God prisoner was the first time Ning had truly been able to go
all-out in a sustained battle. The insights he had gained over the
course of six hundred years in Undermoon Lake, combined with the new
ideas he had gained while battling Daomother Devilheart, were all
being brought to the surface. In fact, as they continued to fight, he
began to suddenly gain insight into some of the intricacies of the
sword-arts left behind by World God Northrest that he previously
didn’t understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Sword-light
flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God prisoner’s
body was split in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put away his
sword, standing quietly to one side and watching as the prisoner’s
divine body merged together and healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God stared at
Ning, a complicated look on his face. From the way in which Ning had
continuously increased the power of his sword-arts, he could sense
that Ning was far more talented and gifted than he was. In truth,
every single person who was successfully in mastering a technique
that surpassed the Heavenly Daos in some way was an absolutely
peerless genius.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God prisoner
said in a low voice, “I lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a surge of
joy in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the mysteries
of the sword couldn’t be understood simply through meditation. Only
true life-and-death battles would allow one to truly understand how
those mysteries were to be used and applied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that this
True God’s axe-arts aren’t strong enough. It would’ve been
better if he was stronger,” Ning mused to himself. “A single
life-and-death battle like this is worth more than a year’s worth
of meditation. Mm. Time to go seek out the next True God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, prior to
finding the next True God, he would have to take away this prisoner’s
treasures. His Violetjewel sword was in desperate need of Five
Elements essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he had to
use some Protocosmic spirit-treasures to slowly grind away at the
energy reserves of a True God or True Immortal in order to beat them.
He would then tell them, ‘So-and-so has already submitted to me.
All those who resist me will die.’ He would use words to threaten
them and bully them. Although he was occasionally successful, those
successes made up just a tiny portion of the total number of True
Gods and True Immortals in the prisonworld. The more powerful one
was, the less likely they would be willing to lower their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To rely on slowly
exhausting his foes required him to spend decades for each True God
and True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, he could fight
them head-on! Things would be much faster than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you willing to
submit?” Ning looked at the True God prisoner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God prisoner
returned to his emaciated, skinny form. Lowering his head, he gritted
out the words, “I am willing.”

Chapter 32 - An Unexpected Surprise
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning first
soulscoured him, then took away his treasures. Of course…he gave
the True God some spirit-pills as well. Due to their length battle,
this True God had used up quite a bit of his divine power; if he
wasn’t given enough spirit-pills, his life probably wouldn’t last
for much longer. Although there was no way to replenish his divine
power, replenishing his Immortal energy would also suffice for him to
sustain his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were relatively
few Ki Refiners who also trained as Fiendgod Refiners, but almost
every single Fiendgod Body Refiner was also a Ki Refiner; the only
question was how talented they were in that respect. Subhuti, Daoist
Three Purities, Tathagata, and many others were all born as True
Gods, and they eventually trained to become Daofathers of the Great
Firmament as Ki Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through the use of
spirit-pills, these prisoners would be able to live a very, very long
time. Right now, they only used up energy to keep themselves alive,
after all; their energy expenditures were quite low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that it is
unlikely that I’ll find what I need from the memories of these
prisoners,” Ning mused to himself. “Still, it makes sense. I’ve
already acquired many techniques from World God Northrest. Given what
I already have, it is quite unlikely that a prisoner of Pangaea will
be able to provide me with a nice surprise. Still, I won’t give up
hope, no matter how faint it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different chaosworlds
would give birth to different civilizations. Perhaps some of them
would produce unique techniques of their own. With the Endwar nigh,
Ning naturally wanted to seize every chance he could find to grow
more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One had to remember
that the prisonworld itself had been located in the hands of someone
as weak as Youngflame Freak. The prisoners of Pangaea were far more
powerful than Youngflame Freak; perhaps one of them might’ve had a
great stroke of fortune in the past and acquired certain special
treasures or unique abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning landed
atop an island within a placid lake. With a wave of his hand, he
caused the jade shrine to descend upon the island as well as many
stone steles. Finally, the enormous goldstar beads plummeted like
meteors to land on the island as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped into the
jade shrine, then sat down in the lotus position atop the prayer mat.
He stilled his mind, beginning to mentally go through his recent
battles and experiences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single battle had
to be analyzed with great care. He had to pull the experience he
needed out of them and use it to improve himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
True Gods and True Immortals in the prisonworld; after fighting all
of them, Ning would no longer be able to find any new opponents.
Thus, he had to value every battle and opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent more than
ten days meditating on his insights, supported by the goldstar beads
and the stone sword-steles. After ten days, he had gained all that he
could, and so Ning put away the treasures and once more transformed
ino a streak of black lightning, flying towards the next True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battle. Meditation.
Battle. Meditation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It became a regular
pattern!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gained experience
from every single battle, allowing him to further perfect his
sword-arts. However, upon encountering the fifth True God prisoner,
Ning suffered a sudden, unexpected loss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, ugly, skinny
old man’s six arms all rapidly expanded in length as he sent his
six claws tearing towards Ning from multiple directions. His
claw-arts were unfathomably strange, and Ning’s body was covered
with blood. Just now, he had been able to withstand the first wave of
attacks but his body had been ripped open. In the face of this
terrifying opponent, it seemed that the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
wasn’t going to be very useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mirrors of the
Heavens!” The battered Ning immediately willed it, and the skies
above him became filled with ancient copper mirrors. The 3600 mirrors
hung in the air, blocking the impending claw attacks and buying Ning
just a tiny bit of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly used the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique to dodge more than a thousand
kilometers away, leaving the jail ‘cell’ region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
True God Ultrafish. It seems that the information I gained from
soulscouring the other True Gods and True Immortals wasn’t
completely correct.” Ning stood outside the restrictive formation,
filled with terror at the close call. This foe’s claw-arts were
absolutely terrifying; Ning had been badly injured in their very
first clash, and the only reason he had been able to survive was
because his own sword-arts were formidable as well. Otherwise, he
would’ve instantly been ripped apart into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t just pick
foes randomly; there was a plan behind it. He had soulscoured many
prisoners and thus he knew a fair amount of information regarding the
many True Gods and True Immortals of Pangaea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had mentally
divided these True Gods and True Immortals into three different
types.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first type was
comparable to an ordinary Daofather of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second type was
comparable to a elite Daofather of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful type
was close to overlord-class Daofathers in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of these True God
and True Immortal prisoners were at a fairly low level of insight
into the Dao, with very few having gained insight into the Heavenly
Daos. This was why most of them were merely comparable to ordinary
Daofathers! Some, by relying on powerful divine abilities that were
as dominating as Ning’s own [Starseizing Hand], were able to
unleash the power of a elite Daofather. And some were like True God
Ultrafish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God
Ultrafish…in the memories of the other True Gods and True
Immortals, he was supposedly quite an ordinary True God with very
ordinary divine abilities.” Ning mused to himself, “I didn’t
expect that he would’ve reached the fifth stage in abyssforce; in
terms of power, he should be comparable to a elite Daofather now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Abyssforce wasn’t
that powerful in attacking, relatively speaking. If Ultrafish had
reached the fifth stage in an offensively oriented type of power like
swordforce, Ning probably would’ve been completely destroyed in
their first exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really was true that
True God Ultrafish’s life experiences and luck had been average,
resulting in him not being able to acquire any particularly powerful
divine abilities. Otherwise, if he was able to use them in concert
with his fifth-stage abyssforce, he would absolutely be close to an
overlord-class Daofather in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to be more
careful,” Ning mused to himself. “Although I do have the
intelligence I gained from soulscouring those prisoners, they’ve
all been trapped here for a very long period of time; it isn’t
strange that some of them may have made breakthroughs. Mm…in the
future, each time I fight someone, I need to first use [Three Heads,
Six Arms]; just now, if I had used that technique, I wouldn’t have
suffered so badly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been so caught
off-guard by the suddenly, unexpected danger that he didn’t even
have the time to activate the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique,
to say nothing of [Three Heads, Six Arms].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three Heads, Six Arms]
allowed him to manifest two more heads and four more arms with his
divine power. This meant it needed time to activate, albeit just a
tiny bit of time. By comparison, activating the [Starseizing Hand]
was so fast as to be nearly instantaneous, requiring just a thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…kid, is
that all you have? And you want to make me submit?” The tall,
skinny old man laughed in an ugly manner. “You ran pretty fast just
now, and your mirrors are quite bizarre as well. Otherwise, you
would’ve lost your little life. You should feel lucky that you
managed to witness my claw-arts and survive to tell the tale.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God Ultrafish.”
Ning actually chuckled. “Very good. Yet another powerful opponent
for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Opponent?” The
skinny old man laughed coldly, “You want to use me as a way to
train yourself? Hmph. Careful that you don’t die from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be back.”
Ning turned, transforming into a black lightning streak that quickly
flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The tall,
skinny old man watched coldly as Ning left. After Ning departed, he
finally frowned “This Overseer has a pretty Immortal energy aura,
but his divine power’s aura is clearly weaker than mine. Just now,
I actually wasn’t able to kill him in one blow, and his sword-arts
really were quite fast, even faster than my claw-arts. Was that a
sword-art that has surpassed the Heavenly Daos? Where did he learn
such a thing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt happy
whenever he encountered a powerful opponent. He could sense that he
was continuously improving, and that he was gaining more and more
insights into the sword-arts left behind by World God Northrest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
voyage through the prisonworld, battling True Gods all the way. Some
True Gods, Ning could defeat. Some, Ning could just barely fight to a
standstill. Whenever Ning encountered foes like these, he would
immediately leave after a short battle. He would come back for them
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also some
who could completely suppress Ning in strength. In fact, there were
some like True God Ultrafish who could very nearly kill Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the most
absolutely, monstrously talented True Gods who were comparable to
Elders Gods or overlord-class Daofathers in strength…Ning didn’t
even dare to touch them. He didn’t have an Envoy on him right now;
fighting such an opponent would be like courting death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, if he chose
to focus on long-range attacks using his Daofather-level energy with
his [Brightmoon] sword-art, he would definitely be able to match a
elite Daofather in power. But Ning’s goal here was to temper his
sword-arts, which was why he focused on close combat, which his
weakness right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True God’s body
was split in half and knocked flying away. Far off in the distance,
the two halves joined together into a new whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” Yet
another True God bent the knee to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out with
his hand, placing it atop the True God’s head. The True God did not
try to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly flipped
through this person’s memories, discarding all the useless ones in
search of something that would benefit him. Although none of the
previous soulscours had proved fruitful, Ning had never given up. So
long as there was even a hint of a chance, he would continue in his
current path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
saw a seemingly ordinary memory, but was instantly stunned by it.
Then…he revealed a look of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Heavengazer Tower
of Radiance?” Ning murmured to himself. “A treasure like this
actually exists? How marvelous. The chaos-kingdom of Pangaea truly
does have a much more powerful foundation than that of the Three
Realms.” Ning’s pulserate began to quicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heavengazer Towers were
a type of Chaos treasure…and the type which Ning desperately needed
right now. In truth, while soulscouring his defeated opponents, Ning
had discovered quite a few treasures which he desired, but none of
them existed within the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavengazer Tower’s
owner, however…was imprisoned right here inside the prisonworld!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did Ji Ning need
the most right now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in desperate
need of more time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His talent was beyond
dispute. Even as a youth, Patriarch Lu and Subhuti had favored him.
After experiencing so many things, he had only become an even more
outstanding figure. An Immortal cultivator’s talent wasn’t
something that was set in stone; it could change and transform as he
grew up and experienced all sorts of events. Some might regress,
while others might soar to the heavens and become increasingly
dazzling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning was the
type to become more and more dazzling…but even the most monstrous
of geniuses needed time to grow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Treasures that could
change the rate at which time flowed…yes, they existed in the Three
Realms. The Grand Xia Emperor, for example, had been able to use the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers to change the flow of
time within it! But this sort of temporal change used up an enormous
amount of energy, even though the magic treasure itself was helping
to facilitate it. Although the Xia Emperor was a Pure Yang True
Immortal, he was only able to allow some weak Wanxiang-level children
to experience a different rate of time. He wasn’t capable of doing
the same for Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was an Empyrean
God and True Immortal. To change the rate of time for him…even
Subhuti and Daoist Three Purities would feel a headache if they had
to come up with such an idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Mother Nuwa was
still around, she would be able to do it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had created
the Six Paths of Reincarnation. Time flowed at a much, much faster
rate than normal in the region around the Bridge of Despair and the
Six Paths of Reincarnation! Countless souls flowed into the place,
but time continued to flow through the area at a terrifying pace
without the need for any Immortals or Fiendgods to use up their
energy to maintain it. This was because the Six Paths of
Reincarnation were made perfectly; they used up very little energy,
and the amount of energy they absorbed from the outside world was
more than enough to sustain themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Six Paths of
Reincarnation were a formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavengazer Tower
of Radiance was a magic treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the Heavengazer
Tower, time was stably maintained at a rate that was ten times faster
than that of the outside world. Ten years would pass inside for every
year that passed outside. This was an extremely stable mechanism, and
there was no need for any outside sources of energy. The treasure
itself was a stable spacetime dimension of its own. Even True Gods,
Daofathers, and World Gods could go inside it, and time would still
flow at ten times the normal right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This magic treasure
could also be used to accelerate the speed of time even further!
However, if one wanted to go beyond the ‘base’ of ten times
normal speed, one would have to use up some Immortal energy. In
addition, the more powerful the user, the more energy would be used
up in speeding up time for cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A stable spacetime
treasure,” Ning marveled. “My master Subhuti was able to
establish the Crescent world in a different fold of spacetime, but
not even he would be able to forge such a stable spacetime treasure
such as this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stable spacetime
treasures were far too difficult to make. This was the only one Ning
had ever heard of, and it was a Chaos treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than anything
else, Ning needed time. The Heavengazer Tower was able to speed up
time by a factor of ten, and if Ning was willing to use up some of
his energy, it would be able to speed up time even faster. Most
importantly of all…this treasure existed within the prisonworld. A
True God was carrying it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God Shiyu?”
Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The possessor of the
Heavengazer Tower was True God Shiyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This True God, however,
could be said to be the most terrifyingly powerful True God in the
entire prisonworld. Almost all of the True Gods and True Immortals
imprisoned here knew of him, but very few knew that he was in
possession of the Heavengazer Tower. Ning had soulscoured many True
Gods and True Immortals, but he had only learned this bit of
information now because the True God which Ning had just soulscoured
had been one of True God Shiyu’s subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s very hard to
deal with. He’s clearly just a True God, but he once battled
against Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. If you factor in the
Heavengazer Tower, he has a total of three Chaos treasures,” Ning
mused to himself. “Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals…in the
Three Realms, they would be considered overlords. In other words,
he’s at a level of power which is close to that of an
overlord-class expert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exhausting his
energy reserves? That won’t work either. He’s at a very high
level of enlightenment; he’s one of the tiny handful of True Gods
and True Immortals in the prisonworld who is able to draw energy from
the primordial chaos,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One had to have a
certain degree of insights into the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos
in order to be able to extract energy from it, but once this became
possible, one would no longer have to worry about one’s energy
being used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were capable of this, but only a tiny number of
True Gods and True Immortals were. True God Shiyu, however, was
obviously one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
How should I deal with him?” Ning pondered to himself. “I put the
Starseizing Manor in the Crescent world…but even if I went back
there to gather the people I need for the Rahu Formation, I’ll
still be significantly weaker than someone of the overlord level of
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had fought against
an overlord-class expert before. Daomother Devilhand, using just one
hand, had been able to defeat Ning while he was in command of an
Envoy. But of course, her attacks were considered extremely
formidable even amongst other overlord-class Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for True God Shiyu,
he was only able to stay alive in the face of attacks from Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals; in terms of raw power, he probably wasn’t
much stronger than Ning had been when controlling the Envoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps, when my
swordforce reaches the fifth stage, I’ll have a chance of beating
him,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
battle his way through the prisonworld. He no longer solely fought
against True Gods; he even began to act against the True Immortals as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was constantly
gaining insights into the mysteries behind the sword-arts left behind
by World God Northrest in the hopes of reaching the fifth stage of
heartforce as soon as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was slowly
improving nonstop, he still felt as though he was just a hairsbreadth
away from reaching that stage. This sort of feeling was absolutely
maddening. However, Ning was able to remain quite calm. He knew that
so long as he continued to advance like this, sooner or later he
would make his breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on, day by day, month by month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another great
Realmwar was taking place now, this time on the Kingshill major world
of the Zhuanxu Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the second
Realmwar to occur after the one in the Yellow Emperor Realm. In terms
of size, it was considerably smaller than the Yellow Emperor
Realmwar, but it was still far larger than many of the Realmwars that
had come before it, such as the Crimsonbright Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Nuwa Alliance’s
side, there was a total of more than eight hundred Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Seamless Gate’s
side, there were six hundred Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, along
with a supporting army of golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s hard to say
who will win this Realmwar.” Daofather Netherjade was standing atop
a wall, staring off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
chuckled. “That’s normal. The war for karmic luck inherently
involves an element of luck as well. All we can ask for is for no
more monsters like Ji Ning to appear out of nowhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial Era
gave birth to Houyi, while the Three Realms gave birth to Ji Ning.
Enough already. If the Nuwa Alliance was to produce a third such
monster, we should just go ahead and give the damn war up.”
Daofather Netherjade shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Houyi truly
is terrifying.” The black-robed Godking sighed. “I never heard
anything about his axe-skills. Didn’t he always use arrows in the
past? Archery is a long-range form of combat, while axes are used in
close combat. The difference between the two is enormous. How could
he have become so powerful with a hatchet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that long
ago, Houyi tried to chop down the divine osmanthus tree of the Lunar
Star.” Daofather Netherjade chuckled. “That osmanthus tree isn’t
so easily chopped down. Anyone capable of chopping it down would
probably be capable of annihilating the entire Lunar Star. I’ve
always heard that Subhuti’s eldest disciple spent all of his days
chopping down trees as a woodcutter. Now, it seems, it was because
Houyi has never given up on chopping down that osmanthus tree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m worried…”
Daofather Netherjade frowned. “Houyi’s greatest talent always lay
in his arrows. If he’s that powerful with the hatchet…how
powerful have his arrows become?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly. He’s
going to be trouble. If his archery skills are too formidable, when
the Endwar erupts, most likely only uncle-master Everwood or the
Fiendlord would be able to withstand him,” the black-robed Godking
sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daofather
Netherjade nodded, then sighed again. “Even though it is true that
the Endwar is rapidly approaching…I have to admit, Ji Ning is every
bit the monster that Houyi was. In fact, he’s grown at an even more
astonishing level of speed. In just a few short centuries, he’s
mastered a sword-art that surpasses the Heavenly Daos. A peerless,
monstrous Sword Immortal like him…if he’s given a few thousand
years, it’s hard to imagine how powerful he will become. He would
probably become another Houyi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he had
never truly cared about Ji Ning, but the battle at the Deerchaser
world and the sight of Ji Ning clashing against Daomother Devilhand
had truly caused the Godking to feel nervous. He had to admit…Ji
Ning’s potential was downright horrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Prisonworld 17,
located inside the stone stele that had been placed inside the gorge
of that frozen star in the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five years had passed
in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been five years
since his ‘assassination’. Ning had come to this world,
determined to temper himself through battle, and he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a beautiful
grassland, there was an absolutely dazzling shrine that seemed to
have been carved out of pure jade. Inside the jade shrine, a
white-robed youth was seated in the lotus position, his eyes closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of power,
birthed from the essence of the sword and located in the deepest
recesses of the primordial chaos, began to flow to this location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An indescribably arcane
and profound aura began to swirl in the area around Ning, a
terrifying, heart-stopping aura that belonged to the essence of the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, Ning’s very
body began to emanate with dazzling, rainbow-colored sword-light. It
was as though Ning himself had become transformed into an utterlying
terrifying sword.
</P>

Chapter 34 - Swordforce, Stage Five
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s eyes were
closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many insights he
had gained into the sword were continuously merging together. It was
like mist being condensed. Finally, with a boom, the mist completely
condensed into a ‘seed’, a seed surrounded by a faint aura of
sword-ki. This sword-ki seed was the complete crystallization of all
of Ning’s insights into the essence of the sword. It was something
which he could sense in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t something
that could be seen with the naked it. It was something that could
only be seen and sensed by the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-seed had
been planted within Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a soft breath, then opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade shrine had
become quiet and peaceful once more. The rainbow-colored sword-light
surrounding Ning had vanished as well, and Ning now looked as
ordinary as ever. However, his eyes dimly shone with a sharpness that
struck fear in the hearts of others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When one’s
insights into the sword crystallize into a seed, it will naturally
gain a soul of its own,” Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the guidance
of World God Northrest, Ning knew exactly what a Sword Immortal’s
path would be like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stage of
swordforce, ‘Sword God’. When one’s insights into the essence
of the sword reached an extremely high level, after one broke the
final bottleneck a Dao-seed would naturally be formed. Plant seeds
would have to sprout before they could grow, and the same was true
for this Dao-seed, which naturally had the aura of the true essence
of the sword. In fact, Ning’s every punch and kick would now
contain the tremendous power of fifth-stage swordforce, which was the
dazzling, rainbow-colored light that had surrounded him earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
reached the Sword God stage.” Ning stretched out his middle finger,
thrusting it forward as he could a sword. Rumble…instantly,
rainbow-colored sword-light emerged from his finger and swirled
around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainbow sword-light
was incomparably agile, filled with a transcendent aura of sharpness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It felt as though it
could cut through all things ase easily as rotten wood!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was utterly
unshakable and unbreakable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This…this was the
sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder it is this
difficult to reach the fifth stage of swordforce. If it wasn’t for
the Nine Chaos Seals, the assistance of the stone steles, and all
those True God and True Immortal sparring partners, I can’t even
imagine how long it would’ve taken for me to break through.” Only
after making the breakthrough did he truly sense and understand how
different the Sword God stage was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning
understood that the path of the sword was a far longer one than he
had imagined. Even World God Northrest was merely a traveler on that
path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. The more
powerful the path is, the better. If there was a limit to it, it
would be boring.” Ning rose to his feet, walking out of the jade
shrine and staring at the stone sword-steles outside. “I’ve just
barely reached the Sword God stage; I need to carefully stabilize
myself at this new level of power. Next, I’ll once more ponder on
the sword-arts which World God Northrest left behind, so as to
incorporate them into my [Brightmoon].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had instantly become
much easier for Ning to meditate on the stone sword-steles. Many
things which had previously puzzled him had become clear, and his
understanding of the sword continued to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was fusing all of
these insights into his own [Brightmoon] sword-art! The [Brightmoon]
sword-art was the representation of all of Ning’s insights into the
sword, and he had infused it with everything he knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This meditation session
ended up lasting for three months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning was
wielding a Darknorth sword in his hands, gently twirling it around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rainbow sword-light
flowed over its surface, making it seem so dreamlike that it looked
as though it was a series of illusions, making it hard to discern
with clarity. This was the new ‘Shadowless’ stance of the
[Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be hard for
me to improve any further in a short amount of time,” Ning mused to
himself. “True God Shiyu possesses the Heavengazer Tower of
Radiance; no matter what, I have to acquire that treasure. Given
enough time, I’ll be able to grow even more powerful. However,
prior to battling against him…I should first use other experts to
further temper my sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-arts could only
be truly perfected through combat, through trial by battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one completely
focused on meditating, perhaps one might reach a high level of
insight, but one’s actual combat ability would be flawed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who should I choose
to test my sword out? Mm…” Ning suddenly smiled. “Him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wizened old man was
seated in the lotus position atop a desolate grassland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” He suddenly
raised his head, glancing at the white-robed youth that had just
appeared in the skies far above him. The white-robed youth was
charging down towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Overseer?” The
skinny old man revealed a hint of cold amusement. “He actually
dares to return to my place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
landed on the ground, just a few hundred meters away from the skinny
old man. He was now located deep within the restrictive formation,
and the skinny old man would be able to attack him at any time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long time no see.”
Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only been
five years. I’ve barely had enough time to shut my eyes, but you’ve
come back again.” The skinny old man shook his head. “Your
Immortal energy truly is astoundingly vast, and you would be able to
withstand my power if you controlled magic treasures to fight from
afar. You wouldn’t be able to actually do anything to me, but it
would be equally hard for me to kill you. I think you should leave. I
don’t want to waste more of my divine power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This old man was True
God Ultrafish, the one who had nearly killed Ning five years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. A pair
of swords appeared in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The skinny
old man’s face changed. He smirked. “You want to fight me in
close combat again? You?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Me.” As soon
as Ning’s words came out, he immediately charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny old man was
instantly enraged. He was a prisoner here, after all, and so he was
extremely sparing in his use of energy. Every time he used up a bit
of energy, his lifespan in the prisonworld was reduced
correspondingly. He could tell that this Overseer would be quite
powerful in controlling magic treasures, and so he really didn’t
even wish to fight. However, this Overseer was so wildly arrogant as
to actually engage him in close combat again?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he wishes to
die, I’ll send him on the path to oblivion.” Although the old man
could guess that the Overseer had probably made some sort of a
breakthrough, he felt that the breakthrough couldn’t amount to
much. It had only been five years. How big of a breakthrough could it
be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly began
to clash against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s all the
power you have? How dare you come back again!” The skinny old man
bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their two shadows
flickered as fast as lightning as sword-light clashed against
claw-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really have
improved a bit…but it is useless. Although your sword is fast, your
power is too weak. If you were to become a True God, you might have a
chance of beating me, but for now? You are far from that level.”
The skinny old man assaulted Ning with both his words and his
attacks, but he remained unable to defeat Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was extremely
calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had completely
suppressed and withdrawn his rainbow sword-light! Its power was
simply too great; he’d be able to easily defeat his foe, which
wasn’t the result he wished for. He had come here to further temper
his sword-arts, allowing them to grow and be improved. Naturally,
Ning had chosen to suppress his rainbow sword-light, completely
relying on the intricacies of the [Brightmoon] sword-art and his
divine power as a half-step True God to fight this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though he didn’t
use the rainbow sword-light, his [Brightmoon] sword-art was now far
more profound than before, and so he was able to stave off this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break, break,
break!” The skinny old man fought with utterly wild abandon, and
his fifth-stage abyssforce was extraordinarily powerful, but he
remained unable to break apart Ning’s sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword is too
fast, faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos. Now, it has become
even more mysterious and unpredictable than before, and his
techniques have become even more skillful. Although I have the upper
hand, I’m actually unable to defeat him.” The skinny old man grew
frantic. “If this continues, my divine power will be depleted soon.
Although I have Immortal energy as well, I merely have a second-tier
Jindan as a Ki Refiner; I’ll be much weaker than I am now in close
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
battle furiously. As more time passed, the old man grew increasingly
frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about time.”
Ning could no longer see anything new coming from the old man’s
claw-arts, making this fight no longer useful to him. The Darknorth
sword in his hands instantly flashed with the colors of the rainbow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sword God
stage?” The skinny old man called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword, covered
with a layer of rainbow swordforce, instantly increased in power by a
tremendous amount, becoming even more powerful than the old man’s
claw-arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light drifted
outwards, knocking aside the old man’s claws and slicing out in a
solitary, ghostly arc through the old man’s body. The old man’s
body fell apart into two pieces, then rapidly reformed once more. The
old man stared in blank shock at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God
Ultrafish…are you willing to submit?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Ultrafish
stared blankly at him for a long moment, then lowered his head. “I
submit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Ultrafish was
never the arrogant, prideful type as he had a very ordinary status in
the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea. It was only because he had been
imprisoned here for a very long period of time that he had managed to
break through to reach the fifth stage of abyssforce, resulting in
his power increasing dramatically. However, he had long ago grown
accustomed to bowing his head before greater powers. He was
accustomed to submitting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I defeated a True
God who reached the fifth stage of abyssforce, just like that.”
Ning’s face was calm, but he felt great excitement in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was absolutely the
power of a elite Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t used any
formations, nor had he used an Envoy. He had merely used his own
close combat skills to defeat his opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The term Sword God, in
and of itself, represented a group of utterly terrifying figures. The
former number one assassin of the Seamless Gate, the deceased
Swordfather Darklight, had also reached the fifth stage of
swordforce. The awe-inspiringly famous Daofather Fuju, who had been
possessed by World God Northrest, had also reached the fifth stage of
swordforce. And now, Ji Ning had reached the fifth stage of
swordforce as well, and he had also mastered the [Five Treasures]
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifth-stage swordforce,
paired with techniques that surpassed the limits of the Heavenly
Daos…this was undoubtedly the most terrifyingly powerful sword-art
that existed in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts were now
even more terrifying than Swordfather Darklight’s had been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the current Ji Ning
was once more ambushed as he had been a few years ago, Ning could’ve
blocked Swordfather Darklight’s ambushing attack head-on!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days after his
battle against True God Ultrafish, Ning finally set off for True God
Shiyu’s region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beautiful mountain
gorge, filled with flowers and grass. A silver-haired man was here,
attending to the flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black lightning
serpent flew towards him from far away, instantly arriving in the air
above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
silver-haired man raised his head, giving it a glance. He saw a
white-robed youth descending towards him from the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are the new
Overseer?” The silver-haired man looked puzzledly at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God Shiyu, you
actually have the energy and presence of mind to be a gardener?”
Ning said, “Almost all of the primordial chaos energy in this
prisonworld is being refined and distilled into chaos nectar. All of
the Elder Gods, Ancestral Immortals, and supreme True Gods and True
Immortals are doing their best to absorb energy from what little
primordial chaos remains. You only have access to a small amount of
it, and yet you actually use it to take care of these flowers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The environment in the
prisonworld was rather stark and grim. It was a world of perpetual
dusk. Here in True God Shiyu’s gorge, however, there were fragrant
flowers located everywhere. It was completely different from the
region outside the thousand kilometer restrictive formation keeping
him here. Clearly, it was True God Shiyu who was taking care of these
flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my guess is
correct, those Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals are all using the
energy they absorb from the primordial chaos to maintain their
estate-world treasures. Their estate-world treasures contain a world
inside of them with many living creatures, and so the Ancestral
Immortals and Elder Gods have sent their minds and their incarnations
into those worlds, roaming through them and experiencing the
vicissitudes of life.” True God Shiyu laughed softly. “But…that’s
the behavior of a weakling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that they’ve
been imprisoned here, they’ve lost all their motivation and
willpower; all they care about is enjoying life.” True God Shiyu
laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their actions aren’t
exactly wrong.” Ning shook his head. “They have been imprisoned
here for countless years. How many would be willing to endure such
loneliness for so long? If they can’t endure it, why shouldn’t
they go and enjoy life in another world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weaklings.” True
God Shiyu let out a cold laugh. “They have completely given up on
escaping this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? You haven’t
given up?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never given
up. I train in infiniforce and taiji-force; I only need to break
through to the sixth stage in one of them and I’ll be able to break
these shackles. In fact, I’ll be able to break apart this entire
prisonworld as I regain my freedom.” True God Shiyu didn’t try to
hide it at all. All of the Immortals and Fiendgods imprisoned here,
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals included, hoped to make a critical
breakthrough and shatter their fetters, then break apart the
prisonworld and leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you were to reach
the sixth stage, you would be at the World-class of power.” Ning
nodded. “That would indeed be possible. But…you’ve been
imprisoned here for a very long period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nearly five chaos
cycles.” True God Shiyu nodded, staring at Ning. “I know what you
are going to say. You are going to say, if a person is unable to
break through to the World-level within one chaos cycle, it will be
forever impossible for them to make that breakthrough. Am I right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at him.
This was common knowledge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After searching through
many memories of the prisoners of Pangaea, he had learned many
things. Ning had also learned many bits of common knowledge from the
information imparted to him by World God Northrest. If a person
wasn’t able to reach the World-level within a single chaos cycle,
it was virtually impossible for him to succeed for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But there are no
absolutes in life. There’s always a chance.” True God Shiyu
gritted his teeth as he stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It was
true. There really were no absolutes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, perhaps
someone only didn’t make that breakthrough because his cultivation
techniques were too poor, or because he didn’t have a good teacher.
He might spend multiple chaos cycles of painstaking work to become a
‘mere’ Elder God. However, once he gained detailed information
regarding a top-tier cultivation technique or guidance from a
World-class expert, he might quickly break through to the next stage
and become a World God himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or perhaps an Elder God
or Ancestral Immortal might experience an unexpected event that would
allow a breakthrough to be made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short…there was
always a chance of a lucky stroke of fate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the major
powers of the Three Realms had access to truly top-notch cultivation
techniques, and none of them had been guided by particularly powerful
figures. Houyi was a good example. Although he had been alive for
more than a chaos cycle, he had trained painstakingly on his own and
developed his heartforce technique all by himself, as well as his
archery techniques. If he was given truly top-tier techniques or had
the guidance of Vastheaven Palace, however, it was entirely possible
that he would’ve broken through to become a World God by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here in the
prisonworld, True God Shiyu has no one to provide him with tutelage,
and he won’t have any lucky encounters either. It has been nearly
five chaos cycles, but he still wishes to reach the World-level? It
really is almost impossible.” Ning couldn’t help but secretly
sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come here for
just one reason.” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” True God
Shiyu looked at Ning calmly. He didn’t hold this Overseer in any
regard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Heavengazer
Tower of Radiance,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu’s face
changed. He stared at Ning, then let out a cold laugh. “You
actually know about the Heavengazer Tower, eh? What, you want me to
give you a Chaos treasure? You? A trifling Overseer? Your only job is
to watch over this prisonworld. You should just f*ck off and stop
bothering me.” He couldn’t even be bothered to waste words with
Ning. How could he hand over such a precious treasure to someone
else?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, I’ll have no choice but to fight you.” A pair of swords
appeared in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’d actually
dare to assault me?” True God Shiyu was shocked. “Y-you…you
aren’t a member of Pangaea?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chaos-kingdom of
Pangaea would generally send Celestial Immortals with first-tier
Jindans to be Overseers. How would a Celestial Immortal possibly dare
to attack him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangaea has been
destroyed.” Ning held his swords in his hands. “This prisonworld
is now under my control, and you are my prisoner. I don’t wish to
kill you, but you WILL hand over the Heavengazer Tower to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In your dreams.”
True God Shiyu snapped back in a frozen voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll simply
have to fight it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words still
echoed in the gorge, but his lightning-fast streak of sword-light had
already reached True God Shiyu. It was the fastest stance of Ning’s
[Brightmoon] sword-art: Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fast sword!”
True God Shiyu was shocked. He no longer dared to be brash, and he
produced a pair of short cudgels in his hands as well. The cudgel
glowed with golden light, and the head of the cudgel had a triangular
shape to it that seemed incredibly sharp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu’s twin
cudgels had manifested the faint outline of an enormous Taiji diagram
before him, blocking Ning’s sword-attack. After doing so, he
suddenly spun his twin cudgels, transforming the Taiji diagram into
an orb of black light and sending it smashing towards Ning with
frenzied might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning’s own
sword-light transformed into a pair of black holes as he used the
Soleheart stance to block. He could sense an incomparably savage and
bizarre surge of energy smash against him, and he couldn’t help but
be knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power.” Ning landed on the ground, stunned. He immediately
understood that True God Shiyu had to have trained in some sort of
special divine ability that was akin to Ning’s own [Starseizing
Hand], an ability that allowed him to explosively increase his power.
In fact, it was possible that his divine ability was even more
powerful than the [Starseizing Hand]; otherwise, there was no way the
twin cudgels could have produced such enormous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant True God
Shiyu had a solemn look on his face as well. He stared at Ning, not
daring to be overconfident. He said softly, “What a fast sword. It
has surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos? A pity that it won’t
be of use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?”
Ning’s body blurred momentarily, then two more heads and four more
arms grew out of him, allowing him to wield a total of six swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” In
response, True God Shiyu manifested a total of six arms as well. He
now wielded six cudgels, but four of them had noticeably weaker auras
than the original two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two once more began
to clash against each other at full power. As they did so, True God
Shiyu felt even more shocked, because this time Ning used the Blood
Drop stance, Shadowless stance, and Heavenbreaker stance in
succession. The most dangerous attack for True God Shiyu was the
Shadowless stance, as it was both fast and incredibly unpredictable,
making it extremely difficult for him to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those six swords worked
together in harmony, unleashing those three mighty sword stances in a
series of berserk attacks. Although True God Shiyu’s divine ability
was formidable, he still had to fight in an extremely cautious
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
fight for quite a long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flowers and the
grass in the area around the gorge had long ago been reduced to dust,
but True God Shiyu couldn’t spare the attention to worry about
them. Although he had spent considerable time on these flowers, they
were nothing more than a way for him to relieve the loneliness in his
heart. He wasn’t willing to waste the energy needed to maintain an
entire world, and so he used a comparatively much lower amount of
energy to maintain a garden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless. Your
sword-arts are indeed powerful; in fact, I admit that they are
extremely powerful. I roamed the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea for
countless years, and I’ve met more True Gods and True Immortals
than I can count. However, I’ve see no one with sword-arts which
can compare to yours. Sword God stage sword-arts which are faster
than the limits of the Heavenly Daos…and yet, your divine body is
far too weak, and your divine abilities are too ordinary.” True God
Shiyu’s voice echoed within the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two collided once
more, with both being knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt.
Staring at True God Shiyu, he said in a low voice, “It seems I’ll
still have to rely on long-range attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long-range attacks?”
True God Shiyu was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-six Swords of
the Heavens suddenly appeared around Ning, and an enormous torrent of
Daofather-level energy began to flow through them.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_36___Two_Methods"></A>
Chapter 36 - Two Methods
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swords were filled
with Ji Ning’s Daofather-level energy, causing each of them to
emanate auras of blinding might. This caused True God Shiyu’s face
to change as he became even more solemn. “It seems this Overseer’s
abilities as a Ki Refiner are even better than his abilities in close
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant midair Ji
Ning waved his finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
The Swords of the Heavens instantly soared out like streaks of light,
striking towards True God Shiyu from every direction. They didn’t
move that fast, not even surpassing the limits of the Heavenly Daos;
their speed was something which True God Shiyu could handle. However,
as soon as the thirty six Swords of the Heavens closed in on True God
Shiyu, they suddenly sped up dramatically, accelerating past the
limits of the Heavenly Daos. Each of them moved in bewildering,
mysterious ways as well, as all of them were using the Shadowless
stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Brightmoon]
sword-art which Ning created had a total of five stances, each of
which had its own will and intent. Ning designed them to have
unlimited potential; so long as Ning himself could grow stronger,
they could continue to be perfected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish! True
God Shiyu was in a three-headed, six-armed form, and the six cudgels
in his hands swept out in streaks of light. True God Shiyu seemed to
have become an enormous Taiji diagram, capable of blocking all
assaults.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
His long-range attacks were somewhat more powerful than his
close-range attacks, yet he still remained unable to injure his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
you can keep blocking my attacks.” Controlled by Ning’s soul
heartforce technique, the thirty-six Swords of the Heavens attacked
even more frenetically as he put all sorts of dazzling, arcane
sword-arts on display. When they struck in unison, they seemed to
encompass all types of sword-arts…but True God Shiyu just focused
completely on defense, his six cudgels forming a simply flawless,
impregnable defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu
continued to block while roaring with laughter. “Overseer, have you
heard? In the past, I battled multiple times against Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals, but they were unable to do anything to me.
Compared to them, you are even weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we first
started to fight, your sword-arts really did give me a bad scare!
Hah! But although your sword is rather fast, it’s still within the
realm of what I can handle. Even if I just used two arms, I’d be
able to defend against you, to say nothing of using six.” As True
God Shiyu spoke, he actually dispelled four of his arms, returning to
his normal appearance and wielding just two cudgels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two cudgels worked
together in a truly flawless manner, like Yin and Yang coming
together. His defense was completely airtight, and the faint image of
an enormous Taiji diagram completely covered him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had an ugly look
on his face. “How come…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was quite cautious
when we first started to fight. But now, it seems, you haven’t
reached a level of power comparable to Elder Gods or Ancestral
Immortals yet. If I simply focus on defense, I don’t even need to
use my full power.” True God Shiyu said calmly, “I don’t need
to use any divine abilities at all. We can just keep fighting like
this, and I’ll keep absorbing energy from the primordial chaos
here. I can fight like this very a long, long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew this as well.
If he could force the man to use divine abilities, the man wouldn’t
be able to keep it up for too long. Ning would be able to use his
long-range attacks and spirit-pills to slowly exhaust the man…but
now, it seemed, True God Shiyu’s defense was utterly unshakable. If
he didn’t attack and instead focused solely on defense, he would be
able to defend against Ning’s attacks without using any divine
abilities at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals have better abilities than you and greater power
as well.” True God Shiyu said calmly, “But my taiji-force and
infiniforce have both reached the fifth stage, and I’ve merged them
together into a perfect whole. I can survive attacks from Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals and escape to tell the tale. You? You aren’t
even close.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods had divine
bodies that were far more powerful than the bodies of True Gods.
Their bodies alone ensured that they would have close to the power of
an overlord-class expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ancestral Immortals
with first-tier Jindans were far more powerful than the Daofathers of
the Three Realms. They were equivalent to Elder Gods, and the weakest
of them would be close to the overlord level as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The overlord level…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a clear,
dividing line within the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be at the overlord
level meant that one had to have reached the Elder God level of
power. Elder Gods were generally born at this level of power, with
Mother Nuwa being an example. She had also been born with mastery
over the Heavenly Dao of Life. She had then mastered the Heavenly
Daos of Yin and Yang, then the Heavenly Daos of the Five Elements of
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. This ensured that even amongst
Elder Gods, she was at the absolute peak of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Mother
Nuwa had been the number one figure of the Primordial Era, superior
to the other Elder Gods and the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Seamless Gate,
the only one who was a match for her had been the Lord of the
Demonheart. Although Daomother Devilhand had been able to fight
Mother Nuwa one-on-one, that was just in a short clash. She was still
considerably weaker than Mother Nuwa.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was also born an Elder God, but his fleeing skills were superior to
that of a World God’s! From this, one could see how formidable he
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu, in
turn, was able to escape the clutches of a number of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals. From this, one could see how terrifyingly
perfect his fusion of taiji-force infiniforce was. And of course,
True God Shiyu had other divine abilities which could allow him to
unleash incredibly mighty amounts of power. When matched with his
taiji-force and infiniforce, it allowed him to withstand even Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals for a brief period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
assaulted him furiously for a short while longer, then unwillingly
came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that
although I can suppress him in power and force him to focus on
defense, I’m still just ‘close’ to the overlord level of power.
True God Shiyu specializes in defense. Beating him will be very
difficult.” Ning pondered to himself. “But I still have to
acquire the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance as quickly as possible. If
too much time passes, the Endwar might begin. By then, acquiring the
Heavengazer Tower will be pointless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The whole reason why he
desperately needed the tower was because the Endwar was coming soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To grow much more
powerful in a short period of time…” Ning pondered to himself.
“There are two methods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first method is
to become a True God. Once I become a True God…given the power of
the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] and the [One True Body] techniques,
I’ll essentially be half a step into the Elder God realm of power.
Although I’ll still be physically weaker than actual Elder Gods, my
sword-arts should ensure that I’m no weaker than an ordinary Elder
God. By then, I should be at the overlord level of power. Although
True God Shiyu was able to defend against Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals, that was just for a short period of time before he fled.
He’s trapped here in the prisonworld with nowhere to run. If we
really were to get into a fight…once I am at the overlord level of
power, he would definitely lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To actually become a
True God…” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Technically speaking,
he should’ve already fulfilled all the necessary requirements for
breaking through to become a True God long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first requirement
was to have a perfect divine body, and his body had reached that
level long ago. The second was to have mastered a Grand Dao, and Ning
had mastered three of them already; the Grand Dao of Lightning, the
Grand Dao of the Waterdrop, and the Grand Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
[Solitary World God], I’ll need to find a spark of inspiration from
within the midst of endless solitude. Once I find it, I’ll be able
to make my breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That…sounds
incredibly opaque and mysterious. Ugh…the most important thing
needed for the [Solitary World God] is time. The thing I lack the
most is also time.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The critical part of
training in this technique lay in the word ‘solitary’. Once one
actually began to cultivate in it, one would sit there without moving
whatsoever, just like a solitary, withered tree. Only then would one
be able to find that necessary spark of insight. This technique
generally needed a great deal of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second method is
to use Violetjewel,” Ning mused to himself. “Violetjewel was the
most important weapon owned by World God Northrest, and it is
powerful enough that it would cause Chaos Immortals and World Gods to
go crazy over it. According to what World God Northrest said, so long
as I can repair even just the surface layer of the weapon, its power
will vastly surpass that of any Chaos treasures. If I can use this
weapon, my power will dramatically increase as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By comparison…my
chances of repairing Violetjewel in time are probably better.” Ning
nodded to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already repaired
the surface of Violetjewel by roughly 20%. Now, he had reached the
fifth stage of swordforce. Although he was unable to defeat True God
Shiyu, Shiyu was known to be one of the most powerful and most
troublesome Gods of the entire prisonworld. The other True Gods
should be much easier to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sweep through
all of them, acquire their treasures, and then use them to repair
Violetjewel’s surface layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After pondering for a
moment, Ning flew out of the gorge in the form of a black lightning
serpent, disappearing into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu watched
as Ning left, a cold look in his eyes. “He wants to take my
treasures? I have three Chaos treasures on me. If I didn’t have a
few tricks up my sleeves, others would’ve taken those treasures
from me long ago. Ugh…damn the fact that I’m imprisoned here and
have nowhere to run.” Aside from being skilled in defense, he was
also skilled in fleeing…but alas, he was now shackled and had
nowhere to run.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he began
to act against the True Gods and True Immortals of the prisonworld on
a large scale. There were far fewer True Gods and True Immortals here
than there were Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals. Thus, Ning
prized every one of them. After every battle, he would immediately
meditate on any new insights he felt he had gained, so as to gain the
most benefit possible from these battles.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some True Gods and True
Immortals were much weaker than Ji Ning. They only had the power of
an ordinary Daofather, and so Ji Ning was able to easily defeat them.
He didn’t even gain many insights from battling them, only spending
a few hours in meditation afterwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling the more
powerful ones or the ones who had some special abilities, Ning might
spend seven or eight days carefully reflecting on their battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelve months after
Ning began his sweep through the prisonworld. He was within a region
filled with dark fog where a True Immortal was kept prisoner. Boom!
Boom! Boom! The sounds of a major battle could be heard booming out
from within the fog, causing the fog itself to roil and roll about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” The seemingly
berserk violet-eyed woman pointed towards Ning, causing a sky filled
with black light to shoot towards Ning
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his twin
swords in his hands, slowly stepping through the air and advancing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in no rush to
attack his opponent. He just slowly advanced through the air, giving
his opponent plenty of time to attack him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although collecting
enough treasures to repair Violetjewel was important, his own
personal skill and power was his true foundation of strength. He had
to treat every battle against these True Gods and True Immortals
seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Ning’s sword-light fluctuated in an unpredictable manner. He even
used his attacking stance, ‘Shadowless’, to defend against all
the enemy’s attacks. From this, one could tell how transcendent his
sword-arts had become and how vastly superior he was compared to his
foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that your
ultimate attack?” Ning continued to stroll forward as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-eyed woman’s
face was ashen. She growled out, “Come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Instantly, the
countless streaks of black light flew back to her and entered her
body. Only then did her face recover a bit of color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are far more
powerful than me. If you want me to submit, I’ll submit.” The
violet-eyed woman came to this decision in a straightforward manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred and
ninety-two.” Ning nodded and murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-eyed woman
was stunned. What did the Overseer mean by mumbling that number?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
pondered for a moment. “I’ve swept through a hundred and
ninety-two of the True Gods and True Immortals of the prisonworld.
That’s more than half of them. That should be enough treasures to
repair the surface layer of Violetjewel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the treasures he
had acquired from the Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods here,
combined with a few treasures from True Gods and True Immortals, had
only been able to repair a fifth of the surface damage to
Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, he had
collected far more treasures. It was most likely enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to give it a
try.” Ning immediately made the decision to temporarily stop his
campaign and instead go give repairing Violetjewel a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, before
he went to repair Violetjewel, he still had to finish what he came
here to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out with
his hand, letting it rest upon the head of the violet-eyed woman.
Ning was going to search through the memories of every single True
God and True Immortal. Perhaps he might some information which might
be of some help to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to a beautiful
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
Ji Ning, landed on the ground next to it. With a wave of his hand, he
caused the jade shrine to appear on the grassy banks of the lake. The
enormous stone sword-steles landed next, followed by the 3600
enormous Goldstar Beads of the Heavens that surrounded everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then stepped into
the jade shrine, seated himself on the prayer mat, then began his
meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After each battle, he
would carefully reflect on every single thing he had seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had decided
to go repair Violetjewel after this battle, he still chose to first
calmly meditate on the battle he had just experienced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just sat there
quietly in the lotus position. A full day later, he opened his eyes,
rose to his feet, then walked outside the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in quite a good
mood right now. In the past year or so, his sword-arts had continued
to slowly improve a bit, and he had now acquired enough treasures to
be able to repair Violetjewel. With Violetjewel in hand, he would
probably be at the overlord level of power. Even though he might a
bit lacking compared to those elder figures who had long ago reached
this level of power, the difference wouldn’t be as great as it had
been in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nine chaos
Seals.” Ning’s gaze fell upon the nearby goldstar beads, each
roughly ten meters tall right now. The goldstar beads were covered
with the complicated flowing runes of the Nine Chaos Seals, which
continued to change and transform with every moment in a pattern
which was never repeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a smile on his
face, and he continued to look at the beads in quite a fine mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a tremor in
his heart. He stared closely at the constantly changing runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stared unblinkingly
at the runes for a full hour…and then he sat down on the grass and
immediately shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After sitting there
meditating on the grass for nearly a day, Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
willed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! The 3600 goldstar beads all rose into the air in a massive,
dazzling, dense array. They hung high in the air like the stars in
the sky. Ning’s powerful Immortal energy quickly filled every
single goldstar bead. Then, he imposed his will upon them, causing
them to rapidly transform. The aura of every single goldstar bead
began to grow in power. In fact, every single goldstar bead seemed to
grow to become more powerful than top-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures before the strengthening process ceased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
completely mastered the third chaos seal,” Ning murmured softly to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His subconscious had
suddenly connected to a place that was infinitely distant from Ning.
It was beyond space, beyond time, beyond distance itself. In the
past, Ning had never sensed this place before. Now that he had
mastered the third chaos seal, his powerful heartforce, assisted by
the chaos seals, was allowing him to vaguely sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a place that
was filled with an aura of boundless murder and death. It was
infinitely far away from him, but just sensing the place caused
Ning’s heart to shudder…and at the same time, the aura seemed to
stir that killing intent that Ning had buried deep in his own heart,
the killing aura that stemmed from his hatred of the Seamless Gate
and his desire to kill the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes turned
completely red upon being struck by this surge of killing intent. His
veins began to protrude out from his body, which was trembling. Even
with Ning’s skill in heartforce, it took a long time for him to
calm down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t know
was that different people would experience different things upon
mastering the third chaos seal. For example, when Ning had been
roaming the mortal world, he had mastered the second chaos seal and
gained insight into the workings of fate, causing him to become much
more attumed to it. Now, his heart had become filled with a desire to
kill, and his heartforce was also extremely strong, which was why he
became attuned to the essence of slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huff. Huff.” Ning
panted as he slowly calmed down…but as he did, he became even
calmer than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stared at the 3600
goldstar beads hovering in the air. At present, the goldstar
beads…had already transformed into many closed blood-colored lotus
buds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six hundred
blood-colored lotus buds hung there in the air, so beautiful as to
inspire terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense.” Ning
willed it. Instantly, the 3600 lotuses began to merge together, soon
transforming into a total of thirty-six enormous blood-colored lotus
buds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloom,” Ning
ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six
beautiful blood-colored lotus buds slowly began to bloom. Previously,
they were absolutely beautiful, but once they bloomed…a boundless
aura of murder and slaughter instantly spread out ine very direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bloodlotus
blooms only for the sake of slaughter.” Ning could sense how
tremendously powerful the goldstar beads would be in the form of
these bloodlotus flowers. The Goldstar Beads of the Heavens now had
three ideal forms they could assume. The first was the ‘bead’
form which was the most ordinary and well-rounded. The second was the
‘mirror’ form which was well-suited for defense. The third was
this ‘bloodlotus’ form which was perfectly suited for slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The way in which the
bloodlotus slaughtered was different from that of ordinary weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These goldstar
beads…although they were formed from valuable materials, the
crystals that form from the energy left over after stars perish, it
is the Nine Chaos Seals which gives them their true power and makes
them truly valuable.” Ning understood this. The reason why he
became more attuned to fate and could even sense that distant place
of endless slaughter was because of these Nine Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities’ ‘Immortal Slaying Sword Formation’ was derived from
the seventh chaos seal. No wonder it is known as the number one
killing formation of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
bloodlotus flowers. His heart was filled with bellowing rage and
murder, but he also felt strange, unnatural calm that he had never
felt before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” As he was
absorbed in the special mental state that came with controlling the
bloodlotus flowers, Ning could suddenly sense something special
happening within his divine body. His divine body was absolutely
perfect and flawless, with every single cell in his body being
completely without blemishes. However…right now, Ning could vaguely
sense that every single part of his body was filled with desire. An
extremely powerful desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was…as though his
body was starving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sensation was very
vague, and Ning could just barely feel it. But suddenly, a thought
entered Ning’s mind. He murmured softly, “It is said in the
[Solitary World God] that one needs to find a spark of inspiration
from your own body in the midst of solitude. If you find it, you’ll
be able to step into the True God level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that my
body was ready long ago. It has been starving…but in the past, I
simply couldn’t sense it. I had no idea as to what I should do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But now…I’ve
found it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve found that
spark.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile
as he softly said these words to himself.
