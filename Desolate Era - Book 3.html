Chapter 1 - Heart Filled With Murderous Intent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t think of
escaping!” The Bi’An Tiger roared furiously, while at the same
time chasing after Ji Ning on water at high speed. But with each
step, waves exploded beneath his feet. After all, it had yet to reach
the ‘one with the world’ level. It had to rely on its released
monstrous energy to forcibly walk atop the water. In addition, it was
only a land-based beast to begin with. Naturally, its running speed
was even slower!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, even in the
mountains, the forests, or the plains, its speed would probably still
be slightly lower than Ning’s, much less now, on water! It could
only watch as Ning quickly escaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrrr.” The Bi’An
Tiger could only return. Staring at that ferocious battle going on
within that massive formation, the Azure Skysnake King, occasionally
expanding while occasionally contracting, the tiger mused, “How can
this Azure Skysnake possibly resist the magical formation? No matter
how long it struggles, in the end, it will have to submit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation called
upon the natural power of the world and had unimaginable strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Yin Yang Twin
Energy Formation’s power was far beyond the ability of the Azure
Skysnake to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha….”
Ironwood Zhan stood atop the water, pointing at the distant enormous
emerald snake, which was currently entangled by those countless
streams of black and white energy. “Azure Skysnake, now that you
have fallen into my formation, no matter how much you struggle, it is
useless. Best obediently surrender and acknowledge me as master. That
way, you’ll suffer a bit less!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Groooowl.” The
Azure Skysnake raised its head, roaring with fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t submit?”
Although Zhan didn’t understand, he could sense the Azure
Skysnake’s fury and enmity. He immediately laughed coldly, “Azure
Skysnake, in this boundless world, it is the human race which is
truly in charge! It is the Grand Xia Dynasty who has unified this
land! No matter how powerful you are, Godbeast, what can you really
do? Even if I release you, others will come to capture you. I think
you had best obediently submit to me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan was
speaking nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But no matter what he
said, the Azure Skysnake didn’t pay attention to him, causing Zhan
to truly grow angry. “Fine, then. I want to watch and see…if your
bones are tougher, or if my Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation is
tougher!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…” Black
and white energy streams were wildly wrapping about it like a
millstone, grinding the Azure Skysnake’s scales to the point of
shattering, with its jade blood staining the water below. But this
scale-ripping, flesh-tearing pain couldn’t make the Azure Skysnake
lower its proud head in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
suddenly shrank to the thickness of a finger, temporarily escaping
the entanglement of the black and white energy streams, but
immediately afterwards, the energy streams once more wildly wrapped
around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The energy continued to
dissipate and reform without end! How arduous would it be to avoid
these energy streams?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaargh!” The
finger-thick, miniature Azure Skysnake let out a fierce cry, suddenly
transforming to an enormous size once again, even larger than
Serpentwing! Sometimes large, sometimes small, it continuously
struggled. Only in this way would it be able to reduce the amount of
time the Yin Yang energy streams ground down upon it. After all, that
grinding sensation truly, truly was painful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time the
little Azure Skysnake was struggling, it was repeatedly trying to
pounce towards Zhan as well. But the power of the Yin Yang Twin
Energy Formation was simply too great, not giving it the slightest
chance to draw near Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Struggling repeatedly,
the wounds on its body grew greater and greater. Its scales were
shattered, and its jade blood leaked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yaaaaaaa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yaaaaaaa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One fierce cry after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
was still struggling. As a monstrous beast, it was incomparably
arrogant. How could it submit to this human in front of it? If it was
a human Zifu Disciple, perhaps the Azure Skysnake would have been
willing to lower its head, but this Ironwood Zhan wasn’t qualified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” After a long
time, Zhan began to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it still
struggling?” Zhan stared at the Azure Skysnake, still incomparably
wild despite being badly injured and being covered in wounds.
“Although only part of the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation’s power
has been released, if it keeps on acting like this, it will be ground
to death by the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation! Can it be that it
would rather die than submit to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan gritted his teeth.
With a thought, he caused the black and white energy streams binding
the Azure Skysnake to begin to dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake!”
Zhan pointed at the wounded, exhausted Diremonster. “I relied on
the formation to suppress you, so most likely, you aren’t
convinced! Then you and I shall do battle. I won’t rely on the
assistance of the formation…as long as you can defeat me, I will
release you. But if you lose, then you’ll submit to me. Agreed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yaaaaaa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake let
out a few vicious sounds, then transformed to a length of ten or so
meters. This was the most powerful form it could transform into. And
then, it pounced towards Zhan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A long
black whip appeared out of nowhere in Ironwood Zhan’s right hand.
The whip had multiple natural-growing sharp nails embedded into it.
This long black whip was the magic treasure, “Blackwood Vinewhip”.
It was one of the famous magic treasures of the Ironwood clan. With a
powerful whipping motion, he sent the whip towards the Azure
Skysnake, and it transformed into an enormous black blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
rapidly dodged, managing to move past this whip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…”
Ironwood Zhan continued to brandish the long whip in his hand. The
whip spun in circle upon circle, covering the skies in countless
enveloping circles towards the Azure Skysnake. And then, with a
ripping sound, the Azure Skysnake lost yet another piece of scale and
flesh from its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sssssssssssss.”
The Azure Skysnake let out a furious hiss. Despite being wounded, it
still pounced forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan only smiled
coldly, continuing to brandish his Blackwood Vinewhip. This wasn’t
the first time for him to fight against the Azure Skysnake. He was an
expert at using the whip, and was completely able to counter the
Azure Skysnake’s agility! However, the Azure Skysnake was capable
of fleeing very quickly. In the past, Zhan wasn’t able to do
anything about it, but now that the Azure Skysnake was trapped within
the formation, there was nowhere for it to run.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Zhan stood there, long whip dancing, with each whipping blow
containing a power capable of cracking a small mountain, causing the
Azure Skysnake’s body to crack open on multiple locations. “My
strength is greater than yours. You had best obediently submit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The magic treasure’s
slammed against its body. Given that Zhan himself was a late-stage
Xiantian expert, he was completely capable of suppressing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, as it dodged
past through dancing long whip, the Azure Skysnake suddenly
disappeared, and then reappeared a few dozen meters away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan was
astonished, but immediately afterwards, his face changed greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sssssss…” The
Azure Skysnake called out in excitement, while at the same time, with
every single slithering motion of its body, it seemed to teleport
dozens of meters, if not even farther.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ironwood
Zhan’s face was ferocious, and he seemed to have gone insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation
shuddered, and large amounts of black and white energy vicious
slammed down towards the Azure Skysnake, but the Azure Skysnake only
glanced icily at Ironwood Zhan, then disappeared with another
slither.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The black
and white energy collided, transforming into large amounts of chaotic
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnable!”
Ironwood Zhan howled madly, fists waving furiously. “Damnable!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void Blink! Void
Blink!” Ironwood Zhan’s face was ferocious, and his eyes were red
and insane. “This Azure Skysnake is actually capable of using Void
Blink. Right. It is due to that child of the Ji clan. That child of
the Ji clan has battled against the Azure Skysnake repeatedly…it
must be that this has caused the Azure Skysnake to improve, allowing
it to reach the ‘one with the world’ level and be able to utilize
the Void Blink!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan was
utterly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there was only
a single Azure Skysnake in the Swallow Mountain area, there were
quite a few in the boundless territory ruled over by the Grand Xia
Dynasty. Thus, Ironwood Zhan knew very well how powerful Azure
Skysnakes were, which was why he so desperately wanted to tame this
one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Diremonsters were capable of controlling water, or poison, or fire,
or son on and so forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the likes of the
Aquatic Rhino King and Serpentwing, non-Godbeast creatures, had this
ability. But as a Godbeast, the Azure Skysnake King didn’t have a
special ability…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But actually, it still
had something!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only, the Azure
Skysnake King’s natural ability was simply too powerful. While it
was at a low level of power, it wasn’t capable of utilizing it.
Much like how a normal monstrous beast wasn’t capable of
controlling water at the Houtian stage but was able to at the
Xiantian stage, this Azure Skysnake King’s natural ability had to
do with the ‘Void’. Even after it reached the Xiantian lifeform
level, it still had to reach the ‘one with the world’ level
before it was capable of instantly becoming one with the void,
allowing it to utilize the Void Blink technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void Blink!”
Ironwood Zhan ground his teeth. “A Azure Skysnake King capable of
developing the Void Blink technique will quickly become incomparably
powerful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void Blink…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This allowed the Azure
Skysnake to be capable of going to some very secretive places, and
even go steal some of the world’s spirit fruits. This represented
that its growing speed was about to enter a phase of explosive
growth! Without question, this Azure Skysnake King was about to leave
Eastmount Marsh and begin an adventuring journey. After all, only by
going to other places would it be capable of acquiring more natural
treasures and grow more rapidly in power. If it always stayed here
comfortably, it would be a waste of its talent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the amount of
hatred it bears me, in the future, when it returns to Swallow
Mountain, it might come looking for me seeking revenge.” Zhan was
both furious and frightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan bellowed
in fury, the sound of his roars causing even the water to explode!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All because of that
Ji clan child!” Ironwood Zhan ground his teeth, filled with utter
hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning hadn’t
caused the Azure Skysnake King to advance so rapidly, how could it
have suddenly made a breakthrough during this battle? Most likely,
Zhan would have already tamed the Azure Skysnake. Now, he not only
had been unable to tame it, he had also offended a powerful future
enemy. The Azure Skysnake would definitely remember this grudge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive formation
vanished. Ironwood Zhan collected all eight of the formation flags,
then walked out atop the water, a sinister, shadowy look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The Bi’An
Tiger transformed into a black-clothed man, flying over. Seeing the
look on his master’s face, he knew that the taming attempt had
failed. He hurriedly said, “Master, don’t be angry. This Azure
Skysnake was simply too foolish. It was its own fault that Master
killed it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It didn’t die!”
Ironwood Zhan said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It didn’t die?!”
The black-clothed was astonished. “Then it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan shook his
head. “It actually managed to comprehend the Void Blink technique.
It fled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Butbutbut…” The
black-clothed man found it hard to believe as well. The Azure
Skysnake had actually managed to comprehend the Void Blink technique
at the critical juncture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of it is the
fault of that Ji clan child.” Zhan said coldly. “His power was on
par with the Azure Skysnake. After repeated battles, the Azure
Skysnake has improved greatly. Thus, during this battle, it suddenly
sensed the world, allowing it to become ‘one with the void’ and
use the Void Blink technique! This Ji clan’s child ruined
everything. I will definitely strip his skin and rip his tendons.
Otherwise, I won’t be able to get rid of this fury in my heart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
nodded repeatedly. “Master, don’t worry. Before this, I shot
several of my back-spikes at him, which are stained with the
‘Iceflower Liquid’. Some of the Iceflower Liquid has already
gotten onto his body. As long as we release the Ice Wasp, we’ll
definitely be able to find him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Zhan
withdrew a gray sack from his waist. Loosening the sack, a
semi-translucent, gem-like wasp flew out at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pursue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan and the Bi’an
Tiger followed behind the Ice Wasp at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they left, a
green snake suddenly emerged atop the peaceful water. The green snake
stared from afar, a look of hope in its eyes. After it had battled
against Ji Ning so many times, the two of them were evenly matched
for so long. In addition, Ning had helped contribute to it being able
to break through to the ‘one with the world’ level of movement
technique and comprehend the Void Blink technique. It felt some
gratitude towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ssssss….” The
Azure Skysnake let out a soft sound. It hoped Ning would be able to
escape. It had already done what it was capable of. After all,
although right now, he had very formidable fleeing abilities, in
terms of actual power, he was far from being Ironwood Zhan’s match.

Chapter 2 - Comprehending the ‘Dao’ by the Pond
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, relying on his
‘one with the world’ footwork technique, ran at high speed, as
fast as the wind. After leaving Eastmount Marsh, he continued to flee
at high speed, moving most likely over a thousand kilometers through
the mountain forests before coming to a halt. Actually, by now, the
Golden Crow [the Sun] had already completely sunk beneath the
horizon. However, the eastern horizon was still very red, and there
was still some light cast on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew!” Ning wiped
the sweat from his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I first ran three
hundred kilometers on water, then another thousand kilometers on
land. In addition, I was moving at my maximum speed. I’ve never run
like this before. I didn’t expect that even with a body like mine,
I still ended up so sweaty.” Ning usually could run for a thousand
kilometers on Eastmount Marsh without sweating at all, but this time,
he really had moved at his utmost speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feeling exhausted, Ning
slowly walked forward. There was a pool in front of him, and within
the pool, there were a few floating lotus flowers. The flowers were
not stained at all by the mud, and their stems were straight. The
fragrance of the lotuses entered his nose, causing the exhausted Ning
to let out a hint of a smile as he sat down next to the pool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess I managed to
make it through that setback.” Ning withdrew a bamboo reed with a
flip of his hand. The reed was filled with clean water. Raising his
head, he took two gulps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how the
little green snake is doing.” Ning sighed lightly. “Little green
snake, don’t blame me. I’m not able to help you either. Alas, I
haven’t reached the Xiantian level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just thinking about
this made Ning feel a hint of worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens], as the most powerful Fiendgod Body
Refining method, was extremely powerful, but training it was simply
too difficult. Even someone with his background found it so hard to
breakthrough. ‘Merge Yin and Yang, Fuse Fire and Water’. How was
this accomplished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do I need to do
in order to break through?” Ning pondered bitterly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gentle breeze blew
by. The cool, summer night breeze was so comfortable. The breeze
wafted through the lotus flowers in the pool. Some spun in place,
first towards one direction, then towards the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having reached the ‘one
with the world’ level in the [Shadewind Steps], Ning naturally was
able to mentally become one with the wind. When the wind blew past
the lotus blossom, he could clearly sense…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly revealed a look of curiosity. “When the wind blows the
lotus, it turns both left, then right!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly felt as
though he understood something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If a leaf is blown
by the wind, it will be blown wildly without any rhythm at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it was a small
tree that was being blown down by the wind, it would only shake from
left to right! That’s because it doesn’t have any enormous round
leaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But when the lotus
flower is blown upon, the petals of the lotus can turn left or turn
right, cancelling out this force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Raising his head, Ning
stared at the sky. It wasn’t completely dark yet, but in the skies,
he could already faintly see the light of the moon. “The Golden
Crow [Sun] falls, and the Moon Rabbit [Moon] rises!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Turn left, turn
right!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Day and night.
Because there is day, thus there is the concept of night!” Ning
murmured to himself. “In a place of utter darkness, a tiny hint of
light is incomparably brilliant! The left and right turns of the
lotus petal allow it to cancel out the two contrasting spins,
allowing it to cancel out the force of the wind and stay in place,
unmoved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His spirit was already
‘one with the world’, and he became one with the wind and the
lotus flowers in the pool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could faintly sense
some sort of enormous Principle, which hid ancient secrets that had
existed since the creation of the endless universe…this secret, was
the Dao [The Way]! The wind held the Dao within it, and the Dao
itself was vast and unknowable. But when the wind blew past the lotus
flower…Ning was capable of seeing the shadow of the Dao flash
through the lotus flowers. Capable of finding a hint of the movements
and the true appearance of the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quietly sat there
in the lotus position by the side of the pool, completely lost in
thought as he attentively meditated on the hint of the ‘Dao’
which he had sensed from the lotus flowers circular movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comprehending the Dao
was something that one could hope for but not ask for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that moment when his
soul, his thoughts, the environment, and everything else all fused
together, he was able to just barely touch a hint of the Dao. But in
order to touch the Dao…the prerequisite was that one would first
have to become ‘one with the world’. Only after one’s mind
could completely become one with the world was one capable of
touching the Eternal Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” A
stream of water slowly flowed through a small creek covered up by the
wild grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gugugu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night descended, and
the forest was now filled with the croaking of frogs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rays of light began to
surround Ning, still seated in the lotus position. First, some rays
of watery light appeared, slowly forming one enormous lotus petal
after another around him. One watery lotus petal after another
surrounded Ning, currently blossoming while swaying gently in the
breeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards,
dots of fiery light began to gather as well, forming into fiery lotus
petals. These enormous lotus petals of flame also wrapped around
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two layers of lotus
petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first layer was of
watery lotus petals. The second was of fiery lotus petals. Each layer
had exactly three petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!” Fire and
water intersected. A wind arose out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Between the two layers
of lotus petals, a wind arose out of nowhere. The two layers of lotus
petals began to swivel. The lower layer of watery lotus petals
swiveled to the left, while the upper layer of fiery lotus petals
were turning to the right! The two layers of lotus petals were
completely turning in opposite directions…slowly, sluggishly, they
rotated, but Ning himself didn’t utilize any of his own strength at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything happened by
nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” A
gray-furred wolf loped out from within the forests, its jade eyes
focused on that distant, fur-clad youth. Only, those enormous lotus
petals, multiple meters in size, which were surrounding that fur-clad
youth made the wolf slightly confused. As a beast with low
intelligence, however, its innate sense was telling it that those
rotating petals of fire and water were nothing more than part of the
world, just like the clouds…there was no need to pay attention to
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray wolf bared its
fangs, staring at the fur-clad youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very hungry!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad youth was
just sitting there without moving, as though he was asleep. He
definitely wouldn’t have the ability to fight back. In addition,
the flesh of this youth seemed so tender and delectable. The gray
wolf could already feel its saliva coming into its mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It hesitated no more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” The gray
wolf charged forward rapidly, pouncing forward with fangs bared,
preparing to bite down on that fur-clad youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as soon as it leapt
within two meters of those layers of lotus petals…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind created by
those two layers of lotus petals contained within them a hint of the
destructive force of the world. In an instant, it chopped that wolf
into tiny pieces, with blood splattering everywhere, some seeping
deep into the earth, while the rest flowed into the pool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nightfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan and the
Bi’an Tiger he commanded, in the former of a black-clothed man,
were currently following behind that Ice Wasp as they traversed the
mountain forests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ice Wasp was just a
wasp, after all. It wasn’t an enormous flying beast, nor was it a
Diremonster. One could imagine how much slower it was! It was far
from being even a tenth as fast as Ning
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This child of the Ji
clan really can run.” Ironwood Zhan’s face was gloomy and
sinister. “After leaving Eastmount Marsh, he kept on fleeing…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
said hurriedly, “Master, the Ice Hornet’s flying speed is much
slower. If this child of the Ji clan keeps running without stopping,
all the way to one of the Prefectures of the Five Prefectures of the
Ji clan, we probably won’t have any way to catch him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run all the way to
one of the Five Prefectures?” Ironwood Zhan shook his head. “Too
far. Eastmount Marsh is already at the borders of the Ji clan’s
territory. To run from the border to one of the Five Prefectures at
once? That child of the Ji clan shouldn’t run that far.” Although
he said this, in his heart, Zhan was worried as well. If Ning truly
had run to any one of the Five Prefectures, no matter how confident
Zhan was in his abilities, he wouldn’t dare to charge into the lair
of his enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll slowly
pursue him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan said.
“Wherever the Iceflower Liquid passes by, it will leave that unique
aroma. It won’t dissipate for at least three days. We can’t smell
it, but the Ice Wasp can. As long as that child of the Ji clan
doesn’t flee to the Five Prefecture, he will die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, he will die.”
The black-clothed man said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He ruined everything
for me, and caused me to have a powerful future foe.” Ironwood Zhan
could visualize that Azure Skysnake adventuring in the outside world
through the usage of its Void Blink, becoming more powerful, reaching
the Zifu level, then coming back to kill him…he couldn’t help but
feel fear, while at the same time, he hated Ji Ning even more. “I
definitely have to personally tear his skin off and rend his
tendons!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! Tear his
skin, rip his tendons!” The black-clothed man ground his teeth as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow [Sun]
was beginning to raise its head over the eastern skies. It was
daybreak. Ironwood Zhan and the Bi’an Tiger under his command were
still slowly pursuing. They had pursued for so long, both of them had
bellies full of anger. This child of the Ji clan really was too
cautious. After leaving Eastmount Marsh, he had actually fled for at
least another thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Ice Wasp that flew
for a thousand kilometers would be very tired as well. Fortunately,
this Ice Wasp was a mutant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
black-clothed man’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly pointed to the
distant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” The
also-tired Zhan turned to look in that direction. Instantly, he could
make out an indistinct human figure at the distant side of a pool.
This caused his mind to instantly wake up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan’s eyes
lit up. He licked the corner of his lips, then said mentally, “Let’s
go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Between master and
spirit beast, at a close distance, there was the ability to maintain
psychic communications. As for the exact distance…it depended on
how powerful their souls were. Generally speaking, a Xiantian
lifeform and his spirit beast had to maintain a distance of ten
meters if they wanted to be able to converse mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two carefully crept
forward, trying not to make any noise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in truth, even if
they made some noise, Zhan wasn’t afraid. He was, after all, a late
stage Xiantian expert. When running at full speed, he was a bit
faster than even Ji Ning, and in addition, he carried on him a
‘Divine Movement Seal’ as well as a number of other ordinary Dao
seals. How could he possibly allow Ning to escape?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an idiot. No
matter how careful I am, I still am making some noise, but he didn’t
notice at all. He should be a Fiendgod Body Refiner. Logically
speaking, he should have excellent senses. Hmph, hmph, he really has
no experience at all. He’s probably fallen asleep.” Zhan laughed
coldly. “All the better. It will make my life easier. Otherwise,
I’d have to waste a Divine Movement Seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan and the
black-clothed man continued moving forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could make the
person out clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” They were
both stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
Sun had already risen by now. Under the light of the Sun, those
enormous fiery lotus petals and the watery lotus petals appeared
semi-translucent. After all, these lotus petals were not real lotus
petals. They were formed by the energy of the world. Under the light
of the sun, they instantly appeared semi-translucent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two layers of
enormous lotus petals were still slowly swiveling in opposite
directions, but contained within them a very strange rhythm. In the
center of these two enormous layers of rotating lotus petals, Ning
was seated there in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…what is
this?” Zhan, although highly experienced, had never seen a sight
like this. “Can it be that this is created from internal ki?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, even if he
has broken through to the Xiantian lifeform stage, he is still only
an early stage Xiantian. I imagine he doesn’t have any magic
treasures on him.” A fierce look appeared on Zhan’s face.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan and his
Bi’an Tiger drew near at high speed, quickly arriving by the side
of the pool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is
beautiful.” Ironwood Zhan couldn’t help but sigh in amazement as
he stared at the reflecting light of the setting sun, which shone
down upon those two blooming, enormous lotus petals. But the more he
looked at them, the more nervous he became. He was, after all, a late
stage Xiantian expert. Although he hadn’t reached the ‘one with
the world’ level, he could already dimly sense how extraordinary
those two layers of petals were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The Bi’an
Tiger looked at Zhan as well. “What should we do now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. He is in front of us and won’t be able to escape. Let’s
give him a test, first!” Zhan instructed mentally. With a wave of
his hand, he released his Xiantian force, which directly dragged a
rock into his hand. And then, with a powerful throw, he infused this
rock with his Xiantian energy, transforming it into a ray of light
which shot straight towards Ji Ning, still seated in the
lotus-position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he just threw
a rock, a Ninefang Warrior would definitely be killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the stone reached
the area of ten meters of Ning and intersected with those two layers
of lotus petals, it instantly became frozen! That invisible killing
energy, with a hiss, transformed the rock into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bi’An Tiger and
Ironwood Zhan both felt their hearts tighten. They exchanged glances.
Clearly, they were somewhat puzzled by those two mysterious lotus
layers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
it.” Zhan sneered coldly, and the Blackwood Vinewhip appeared in
his hands out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan lashed
out with his long whip. The Blackwood Vinewhip elongated, coiling
around a thick nearby tree. With a massive pull! Honglong…the
entire tree was ripped out by the roots, carrying with it a large
amount of dirt, swinging about along with Zhan’s whip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…this tens of
thousands of pounds heavy tree smashed directly towards Ning, seated
in the lotus position. When the massive tree trunk slammed against
those two layers of translucent, enormous lotus leaves, it instantly
shattered apart. However, the terrifying power of the collision
contained within the massive tree caused the two layers of lotus
leaves to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who had been
meditating in the lotus position, shook slightly. His eyes opened up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his eyes opened, he
saw that the two enormous lotus leaves surrounding his body were
dissipating as an enormous tree trunk smashed down upon him. In the
distance, Ironwood Zhan and that black-clothed man were sneering
coldly at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You ruined my good
fortune!” Watching the two layers of enormous lotus petals
dissipate, Ning instantly realized what he had gained this night, and
also realized how priceless these insights had been. If nobody had
disturbed him, he probably would have been able to gain insights for
even longer. But unexpectedly, Zhan had ruined it for him. It must be
understood that these moments of enlightenment were something which
could only be hoped for and not asked for. It might be decades, if
not centuries, until the next time something like this would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept out with a
palm, and with a booming sound, smashed that massive tree trunk into
two halves. One half landed into the middle of the pond, crushing
many of the lotus flowers. The other half fell down against several
other nearby trees, sending dust everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little child of the
Ji clan!” Ironwood Zhan laughed ferociously. “You fled a thousand
kilometers into the forest, but I still caught you in the end! Today
is the day you die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at him
coldly, and then immediately summoned forth the Lunar energy and the
Solar energy in his body. Over the course of the previous night’s
meditation, he had gained just a hint of insight into the true nature
of the Dao, but that hint of insight was enough to allow him to
understand, without question, what the method was for breaking
through to the next level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]. Nothing in the world was truly opposite of anything else!
It was much like how night and day were seemingly opposites, but in
reality, were just two different aspects of the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like the
two layers of fire and water lotus petals that had surrounded him.
Not only did they not cancel each other out, they had even increased
each other’s power. Why?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A lotus flower had a
stalk, which was what allowed the lotus petals to swivel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘stalk’ of the
two layers of fire and water lotus petals was Ning himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solar energy, Lunar
energy…how to fuse them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By finding that ‘stalk’
which connected the Solar energy and the Lunar energy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
filled with absolutely certainty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body had already
completely brought forth all of his Solar and Lunar energy, which
instantly filled every part of his body. Be it his hair or his skin
or his organs or his very cells…it filled every part of him! Every
single thread of Lunar energy and Solar energy began to swirl around
each other, but their natures caused them to be unwilling to fuse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” All
of the Lunar energy and Solar energy were swiveling, like the lotus
flowers that had been blown upon by the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were also like the
two ‘fish’ of the yin-yang Taiji diagram, forever chasing each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sun. The Moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They constantly chased
after each other…and as they did, they contained that hint of the
Dao which Ning had understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, in the center
of the circling Solar energy and Lunar energy, a new force arose!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that deep, boundless
void, separated from this place by incomprehensibly many worlds,
there lay the two Supreme Stars; the Solar Star [Sun] and the Lunar
Star [Moon]. Each of them emitted a hint of their power; the Solar
Truefire and the Lunar Truewater appeared on each side around Ning,
and also activated the power of fire and water of the surrounding
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding world
instantly became filled with a sea of flame as well as an abyss of
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Though this took time
to describe, in truth, as soon as Ning had shattered that tree, he
had immediately activated the energy in his body and began to break
through. Ironwood Zhan and his Bi’an Tiger saw with their own eyes
the boundless flames and water appear out of nowhere, causing even
them to feel fear. Wherever the water passed through, everything was
frozen into ice sculptures, while wherever the fire passed through,
everything was consumed by the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time,
within the surging water, the faint outline of the Jade Rabbit could
be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
boundless flames, there was also the shadow of a three-legged Golden
Crow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Between the Jade Rabbit
and the Golden Crow, there was Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…”
Zhan was so shocked, his face changed dramatically. “Can this be
the legendary…the legendary [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow and the
Jade Rabbit had both appeared!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without question, this
was the legendary [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the
number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. In the entire Swallow
Mountain area, in at least the past thousand years, there hadn’t
been a single person who was known to have relied on this technique
to become a Xiantian lifeform. Although Zhan had read this technique
and knew what the breakthrough looked like, this was his first time
personally witnessing the amazing spectacle of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.” Ironwood
Zhan’s hands summoned a formation flag out of nowhere. He
immediately flew backwards, then began running around Ning,
surrounded by boundless water and fire, in a circular pattern, while
constantly throwing out one flag after another, all of which stabbed
deep into the mud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In but a few seconds,
eight formation flags had all been planted, covering an area of a
square kilometer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan now
simply stood from afar and watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, kill him.”
The Bi’an Tiger said hurriedly. “Right now, he is breaking
through. This is his weakest moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Zhan
hurriedly shouted. “He trains in the number one Fiendgod Body
Refining, and is currently surrounded by the power of the Supreme
Stars, the Solar Star and the Lunar Star! When breaking through to
the Xiantian lifeform level, these two Supreme Stars will send down a
hint of their Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater, breaking through
countless barriers to allow him to evolve and be reborn into the body
of a true Xiantian-level Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then it becomes all
the more important for us to stop him.” The Bi’an Tiger said
frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you
understand?” Ironwood Zhan’s face was ashen as he stared at the
distant Ning, wrapped by the endless flames and water. “Right now,
he is surrounded by boundless icy water and cocooned in flames. At
the heart of the boundless icy water is a hint of the Lunar
Truewater! At the heart of the endless flames is a hint of the Solar
Truefire! Even if a Zifu Disciple were to touch it, he would
instantly be frozen and shatter or be burnt to ashes, much less you
and me! Not even his soul would be left. He wouldn’t even have the
chance to go to the Netherworld Kingdom to be reborn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As fearsome as
that?” The Bi’an Tiger was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course it is!”
Ironwood Zhan’s face was solemn. “This is power which comes from
the two Supreme Stars! Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater. Who dares
to touch them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then, then are we
just going to watch?” The Bi’an Tiger said frantically. “Just
watch as this child of the Ji clan becomes even more powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry!”
Zhan growled. “Right now, the two Supreme Stars have bequeathed
their power to him, and he is beginning to transcend his mortal coil
and be reborn into a true Xiantian Fiendgod. After he breaks through,
that hint of Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater will disappear. After
all, the power of the Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater doesn’t
belong to this little child of the Ji clan himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan sneered
coldly, “I’ve already set down the Yin Yang Twin Energy
Formation. After this little child of the Ji clan breaks through,
he’ll no longer have the protective power of the Supreme Stars. I
will immediately activate the formation! No matter what, he’ll only
be an early Xiantian lifeform without a single magic treasure. I, on
the other hand, am a late Xiantian lifeform with the assistance of
the formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The Bi’an
Tiger nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this child of
the Ji clan really is amazing!” Ironwood Zhan couldn’t help but
sigh in praise. “[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. This
is the legendary, most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining technique.
Virtually all tribes of a certain size are in possession of it! But
in a thousand years, in the entire Swallow Mountain area, there
hasn’t been a single person who has reached Xiantian through it. If
he is permitted to grow, he will definitely become the number one
person of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan, and perhaps even the
entire Swallow Mountain! But no matter how powerful he will be, right
now, he will only have reached the Xiantian level. Haha…I feel
wonderful when I think about how I’m about to kill such a monstrous
genius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did Xiantian mean?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It meant to be born
from the heavens and from nature. Only that was a true Xiantian
lifeform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
most Ki Refiners only had the inner ki energy in their bodies
transform into Xiantian Afterwards, the energy would wash through
their entire body, allowing them to reach a quick and agile state!
But actually, this was the weakest type of Xiantian body. A casual
sword thrust through the heart would cause them to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But for Fiendgod Body
Refiners…their entire body would be reborn into the body like a
Fiendgod’s. Fiendgods could have their bodies chopped into eighteen
parts, but as long as their head wasn’t destroyed, they would not
die! Generally speaking, most Fiendgod Body Refining techniques were
low-grade, to the point of even relying on tattooing the divine
patterns onto their bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] relied on the power of the two Supreme
Stars to naturally generate those two major divine tattoos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When breaking through
to the Xiantian level, the Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater of the
two Supreme Stars would descend…fire and water would coincide,
giving birth to a Fiendgod’s body! This sort of Fiendgod body
wasn’t one bit inferior to those trueborn Fiendgods of the ancient
Fiendgod Era. Thus, this was reputed to be the number one technique
in the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pipa!” Ning could
sense every single cell in his body explode. And then, the divine
power of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] caused the
Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater to begin to reforge every
single cell anew. The hint of Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater
which the two Supreme Stars had sent down, in turn, were being
utterly consumed in the process of forging this new Xiantian
Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mortal vessel fell
away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod body
formed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua…The Solar
Truefire and the Lunar Truewater were consumed, and the countless
amounts of fire and water which surrounded them dispersed as well,
revealing the fur-clad Ji Ning. Although he had leapt into the
Xiantian level, the furs hadn’t been damaged by the fire and water
at all. Only, Ning’s skin was now emitting an enchanting radiance,
as though he were a gem formed by the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes
and stared at the distant Ironwood Zhan and the Bi’an Tiger. He
said only two words. “Now, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Solar Tattoo
and Divine Lunar Tattoo on his back instantly activated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous flaming
dragon and an enormous water dragon appeared out of nowhere, formed
from the fire and water summoned by the Divine Solar Tattoo and
Divine Lunar Tattoo. Containing terrifying destructive power, it
charged straight towards the distant Ironwood Zhan and Bi’an Tiger!
This was the proof of the Xiantian level of the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; the ability to control fire and water!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Lotus_Petals_of_Fire"></A>
Chapter 4 - Lotus Petals of Fire and Water
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan and the
Bi’an Tiger were both astonished. Zhan hurriedly activated his Yin
Yang Twin Energy Formation, while shouting loudly, “Be careful, he
can control fire and water. The ability of Xiantian Fiendgods of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to control water and fire
is extraordinary. Once water and fire come out simultaneously, even
most ordinary Xiantian lifeforms can be killed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason he shouted
so loudly was because as soon as the Bi’an Tiger had seen the fire
and water, it had already transformed into its real body and begun to
retreat. Once the distance between the two increased, they were no
longer capable of spiritual communication. But how could the speed of
the Bi’an Tiger compare to that of the water and fire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” An
enormous water dragon instantly coiled around the Bi’an Tiger,
causing a layer of frost to appear on it. At the same time, the other
fire dragon also wrapped itself around the Bi’an Tiger. The water
dragon and fire dragon simultaneously coiled around it, the water
dragon filled with boundless cold, while the fire dragon was filled
with endless heat…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hot and cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pa! Pa! Pa!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bi’an Tiger’s
fur began to crack, and his red flesh and muscles began to be
revealed, then quickly char.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grooooooooowl.”
The Bi’an Tiger roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still not dead!”
Ji Ning’s gaze grew colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The water dragon that
had been coiling around the Bi’an Tiger suddenly loosened, then
quickly began to transform, changing into an enormous flowing lotus
petal. At the same time, the fire dragon also quickly transformed
into a blazing lotus petal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The water lotus petal
was below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fire lotus petal
was above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bi’an Tiger was
in the middle. Despite how it tried to struggle and flee, it was
useless. The two lotus petals followed it wherever it went.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus,
smelt!” With a thought from Ning, instantly the two lotus petals
began to slowly revolve. It was like two terrifying millstones slowly
crushing down while revolving. Earlier, Ning had just been
unconsciously activated the energy of the world to form those two
protective lotus petals through his slight understanding of the Dao,
and yet the power had already been so tremendous. But now, Ning was
himself a Xiantian lifeform, capable of controlling both fire and
water. Adding onto that basic power the hint of the Dao he had
understood…the power became hundreds of times greater than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The petals of the
Waterflame Lotus revolved. The Bi’an Tiger caught between them only
felt a surge of heat and cold, and it felt far more miserable than
before! Its entire body seemed to have lost all feeling! At the same
time, as the water and fire intersected, a wind arose out of nowhere,
and that wind filled with a powerful killing force descended directly
upon the Bi’an Tiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ka…” The Bi’an
Tiger’s charred body was like a porcelain doll. It shattered into
many little pieces, its eyes filled with incomprehension as they grew
dim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bi’an Tiger had
died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is actually this
powerful.” Ning’s heart was filled with surprise and delight as
well. “With the water and fire I control as the base, and then
formed into the protective Waterflame Lotus which I developed, I was
able to execute a middle Xiantian level Diremonster, without even
giving it a chance to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the above took
time to describe, a battle between experts was incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the moment when
Ning created the Waterflame Lotus to the moment when the Bi’an
Tiger died, only a heartbeat’s worth of time had occurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” The Yin
Yang Twin Energy Formation which had surrounded this square kilometer
fully released its power as well, and lines of black energy and white
energy criss-crossed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan was
shocked by how easily his Bi’an Tiger had been executed as well.
And then, with a savage expression, he howled, “Within my Yin Yang
Twin Energy Formation, even if you are a monstrous talent which
Swallow Mountain sees once in a millennium, you will still surely
die! Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lines of viper-like
black and white energy instantly pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
instantly fire and water appeared out of nowhere next to his body.
The fire and water transformed into lotus petals, with two layers of
enormous petals of the Waterflame Lotus hovering about him, waiting
for those black and white energy streams to attack. When they
did…with a thought from Ning, the Waterflame Lotus suddenly fused!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like a budding flower,
those upward-pointing lotus petals formed into a massive lotus flower
bud that was over ten meters high, instantly ensconcing Ning within
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pengpengpeng…”
The black and white energy waves came crashing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus,
although having fused into a flower bud, was still slowly swiveling.
The inner layer was made of fire lotus petals, while the outer layer
was made from water lotus petals. They continued to slowly swivel in
opposite directions. No matter how the black and white energy struck
against it time and time again, sometimes just barely breaking
through the outer layer of the water lotus petals, the water lotus
petals would once more reform into their normal appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, fire and
water could always part and reform; they weren’t solid substances
to begin with. Even if they were occasionally broken through, with
but a thought, Ning could reform them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ironwood
Zhan was shocked. “How is this possible? My Yin Yang Twin Energy
Formation…this is an extremely powerful formation. Given my power
when using it, even if I were to meet with an opponent who was a peak
Xiantian lifeform, I wouldn’t be afraid. How could it be that it
can’t even break through the protective lotus of this child of the
Ji clan? What is that protective lotus? How is it that I’ve never
even heard of it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could Ironwood
Zhan know that Ning had previously already reached the ‘one with
the world’ level. The greatest benefit of his previous night’s
worth of enlightenment was…this protective lotus, which already had
a hint of the true meaning of the Dao within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Xiantian lifeform
created by the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was
incomparably powerful to begin with, and the fire and water it
controlled was far stronger than that of the fire and water which
most Diremonsters could create. When infusing that with the hint of
the true Dao through the Waterflame Lotus, blocking a mere formation
naturally was nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ironwood Zhan,
you’ve chased for such a long time. Let me repay you now, and send
you on the next leg of your journey!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the lotus bud,
Ning stared through the flowing water lotus petals and the blazing
fire lotus petals, seeing the distant, unclear figure. In addition,
his mind had reached the ‘one with the world’ level…naturally,
he could sense the auras of all nearby creatures, and could clearly
sense the location of Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought from
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area where
Ironwood Zhan was standing, yet another fiery lotus petal and watery
lotus petal appeared. One above him, one below him, crushing down
upon Zhan like millstones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation, aid me!”
Ironwood Zhan, seeing the situation, was terrified. This was how his
servant, the Bi’an Tiger, had died just now. He hurriedly
controlled the black and white energy streams, wildly wrapping them
around himself to block the grinding, crushing force of this
Waterflame Lotus. By doing so, he was just barely able to block it.
Although occasionally, some fire and water would break through, his
Xiantian ki was able to block it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he
simultaneously create two lotus flowers?” Zhan was filled with
shock and dread. “Such a powerful attack should take up almost all
of his concentration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could he know…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he was four years
old, Ning’s soul was already almost on par with a Zifu Disciple.
Right now, his soul was already far above that of a Zifu Disciple.
Dividing his mind to execute two separate Waterflame Lotus techniques
was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually haven’t
died!” Protected within the lotus bud, Ning quickly charged towards
Ironwood Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.” Ironwood
was so frightened that his face changed. He ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This decision was made
quite decisively. He was, after all, born into the Ironwood clan. He
knew very well that once someone trained to the Xiantian lifeform
level in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the power
of the practitioner would be hundreds of times that of ordinary
Fiendgod Body Refiners. Although right now, Ning was only an early
Xiantian lifeform, he was capable of matching other late-stage
Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiners!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, Ironwood Zhan, was
nothing more than a late-stage Xiantian Ki Refiner. Engage in close
combat with a Fiendgod Body Refiner of this level? That was just
suicide!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this, he had
been relying on the fact that Ning didn’t have any magic treasures,
but if even the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation couldn’t do anything
to Ning, if he were to continue to fight with Ning, would that be
suicide?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An early Xiantian
whose battle power is equivalent to a peak Xiantian. What a monster.
The Ji clan actually produced such a monster. I definitely have to
inform the Ancestor and have him be exterminated as soon as possible.
Otherwise, in the future, he will be a calamity to the Ironwood
clan!” Ironwood Zhan was utterly terrified, especially by those
Waterflame Lotuses. They were simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formations had to be
prepared in advance, but Ning’s Fire Water Lotus could be created
with but a thought, and it was even more powerful than his formation.
This was too…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must be
eliminated.” Ironwood Zhan’s only thought was to go back and
report this to his clan’s Ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Ironwood clan
and the Ji clan…as two of the six hegemons of the Swallow Mountain
area, had Zifu Disciples standing guard over them. That was why they
had the ability to be acknowledged by the Grand Xia Dynasty to become
ministers of the Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine Movement
Seal!” With a flip of Zhan’s hand, a black, leaf-like paper seal
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The paper seal was covered with
what looked like veins of blood, and was covered with an ancient,
strange character which faintly emanated a mysterious, rippling aura.
Ironwood Zhan sent a surge of his Xiantian ki into this seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seal instantly
transformed into a shadowy word which fused into Ironwood Zhan’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!” Ironwood
Zhan immediately transformed into a ray of light, quickly fleeing
afar, not even bothering to collect his Yin Yang Twin Energy
Formation flags.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because
Ironwood Zhan knew very well that right now, he was still relying on
the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation to protect him against that
Waterflame Lotus. In addition, collecting those eight formation flags
would also take up time. It would give that terrifying youth of the
Ji clan a chance to catch up to him, at which point, he wouldn’t
just lose the eight formation flags. He would lose his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He ran?” Ji Ning
hurriedly chased afterwards. His Xiantian Fiendgod body, matched with
his ‘one with the world’ footwork, caused his speed to become
even more rapid. He transformed into a ray of light as well, chasing
after Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just slightly slower
than me?” Ironwood Zhan was greatly shocked. “Before, when he
hadn’t yet broken through to the Xiantian level yet, I was faster
than him. But now, even after using a precious Divine Movement Seal,
we’re roughly on par.” Ironwood Zhan couldn’t help but feel his
heart ache with the cost, but grinding his teeth, he took out yet
another Dao seal, covered with that same ancient network of veins
atop it. He filled his Xiantian ki into that Dao seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another illusory
word appeared, then entered his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light Body Seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” Ironwood
Zhan transformed into a blue blaze as he retreated even faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t be able to
catch him.” Ning’s eyes had a hint of unwillingness to accept
this outcome in them. As an Fiendgod Body Refiner expert, his speed
was already incredible. But Ironwood Zhan had utilized two Dao seals
in succession; a Light Body Seal, and a Divine Movement Seal…although
these seals weren’t nearly as valuable as the ‘Traceless
Talisman’, they were still able to allow Ironwood Zhan’s speed to
explosively increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t have any
Dao seals right now. In addition, even if he had them, he wouldn’t
be able to use them, because Dao seals and magic treasures all
required one to have Xiantian ki in order to use them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan fled out
of the area of the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation, pulling ahead of
Ning, causing Ning to be unable to utilize his Waterflame Lotus
against him. This was because the Waterflame Lotus was formed through
his ability to control fire and water, but there was a limit to how
far a Xiantian Fiendgod could maintain the control. At too great a
distance, control would no longer be possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Ironwood Zhan let out a sigh of relief. Without the threat from the
Waterflame Lotus, and having pulled away from Ning, he finally
relaxed. But then, he was filled with hate. Hatred for this Ji Ning.
After all, he had lost his Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boy of the Ji clan,
feel happy for now. I will definitely report this to the Ancestor,
and also to Snowdragon Mountain! The Ji clan is the mortal foe of
both my Ironwood clan as well Snowdragon Mountain. A monster like you
is someone which both Snowdragon Mountain and my Ironwood clan will
eradicate as soon as possible.” Ironwood Zhan’s heart was filled
with hatred.

Chapter 5 - Plum Blossom Fragrance, Assailing the Nose
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan moved as
quickly as a ray of blue smoke, fleeing at high speed. Right at that
moment, the many large, tall trees in front of him suddenly began to
crash down in front of him, completely blocking the road ahead of
Zhan. Some of those trees even flew through the air towards him at
high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going on?”
Ironwood Zhan’s face lost all color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a mighty wave of
his black vine whip, he transformed it into a series of rays of
light, slicing towards several trees that were flying towards him. As
though they had been chopped apart, the large tree trunks were split
in half, but Zhan’s speed had been lessened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahua…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From every direction,
many branches, tree trunks, and even boulders and chunks of earth all
began to fly over, wildly throwing themselves at Ironwood Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, what is going
on?” Zhan was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These boulders,
branches, trees, why are they all flying towards me?” Zhan had
never heard of something like this. Even a Zifu Disciple would only
be able to fly on his own magic treasures by standing on them, then
ordering the magic treasures to fly! Not even Zifu Disciples were
capable of making ordinary items fly like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless boulders and
tree trunks filled the sky, smashing towards Zhan and forcing his
speed to lessen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ironwood Zhan, you
won’t be able to flee!” From behind, another ray of light shot
towards him. It was Ji Ning, and Ji Ning was shouting at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did you
accomplish this?” Zhan shouted while slicing through the trees,
hoping to continue to be able to flee, but under the attack of the
surrounding earth, boulders, and tree trunks, he wasn’t able to run
at high speed at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning only smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had accomplished
this. Just then, after Zhan had used the ‘Divine Movement Seal’
and the ‘Light Body Seal’, he had nearly fled. Naturally, Ji Ning
had grown desperate! In that frantic moment, Ning had discovered that
his powerful thought waves were causing even the water of the pool
and the earth to shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could clearly sense
how his consciousness seemed to have become an invisible hand,
capable of grasping the nearby trees and mud, as well as all other
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine will!” Ning
instantly was filled with a surge of wild joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a soul grew
excessively powerful, some strange things would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Zifu Disciples were capable of splitting their minds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Wanxiang Adepts were capable of ‘divine will’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal Daoists were
capable of opening the ‘eye of heaven’ and utilize their ‘divine
sense’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">visualization
techniques were extremely rare and mysterious. In the Ji clan, nobody
had even heard of such a thing as a visualization technique! If one
wanted to strengthen one’s soul? Generally, the only method was to
train their will, meditate on the Dao, and strengthen first the body,
then the soul. Ji Ning’s training in accordance with the [Nuwa
Painting] had already nearly reached a limit. That night of
enlightenment towards the Dao had been extremely beneficial to his
soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After gaining a greater
understanding of the Dao, fire and water had then descended from the
heavens, giving him a Fiendgod’s body. As the body grew stronger,
the soul would strengthen once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unconsciously, Ning’s
soul had already reached the level of being capable of ‘divine
will’! Only, he didn’t know that until when Ironwood Zhan had
fled. Desperate, Ning unconsciously had caused his willpower to
affect the water and the earth, which made him realize what he had
achieved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to flee.” Ning used his divine will to control the nearby things,
causing the nearby trees, mud, and stones to all surround Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that this
wasn’t done by this child of the Ji clan? Is there a terrifyingly
powerful practitioner of the way of Immortal who, seeing the talent
of this child, has decided to help him?” Ironwood Zhan was unable
to flee, try as he might. He felt both frantic and terrified
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
Ning’s gaze focused on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous fire lotus
petal appeared above Ironwood Zhan, while an enormous water lotus
petal appeared beneath Ironwood Zhan. At the same time, the two
slowly began to swivel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know which
elder is present?” Ironwood Zhan called out loudly, while revealing
a Dao-seal in his hand. This Dao-seal transformed into an illusory
diamond, then disappeared into his body, and his body began to glow
with a faint golden light. “I am a disciple of the Ironwood clan,
and I am on very good terms with Snowdragon Mountain as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop struggling.”
The formerly distant Ning had already arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child of the Ji
clan.” The golden light on Ironwood Zhan’s body was trembling and
swaying. He repeatedly, viciously twirled out the Blackwood Vinewhip
in his hand, which quickly elongated as it flew towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a sword in
each hand. He was as fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!” The
Darknorth sword in his left hand utilized the ‘Watertight’
technique. As soon as the Blackwood Vinewhip touched the Darknorth
sword, it naturally wrapped around it, but Ning voluntarily began
spinning his left sword…the Blackwood Vinewhip wrapped around it
many times, and in the end, Ning’s left hand actually was able to
snatch the Ironwood Vinewhip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s right hand
reached an even faster level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Zhan
roared fiercely while pulling at the Blackwood Vinewhip, but he
wasn’t able to budget it at all. “No, I can’t die here. I can’t
die to this little child of the Ji clan!” Sensing death draw
nearer, Ironwood Zhan became even crazier. He even released the
Ironwood Vinewhip in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Turning his head, he
continued to flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Slowly
being ground down by the Waterflame Lotus, the golden light on his
body finally cracked and dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaah.” Ironwood
Zhan’s clothes were instantly ground into dust by the Waterflame
Lotus, revealing his body, which was beginning to turn black. He
emitted an agonized scream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A raindrop pierced
straight through Zhan’s forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the
Waterflame Lotus dissipated. Ning withdrew his sword, looking quietly
at the charred Ironwood Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan’s eyes
were bulging. Even his eyebrows were gone, while in his forehead,
there was a bloody hole. His eyes were filled with disbelief and
rage. He hadn’t imagined that he would die at the hands of this
youth. In his heart, he even more hated that ‘elder’ who had
blocked his flight. If it hadn’t been for that elder practitioner,
he would have been able to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal
practitioner?” Ning said to himself softly, his heart filled with a
silent excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had finally become a
Xiantian lifeform!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the world-famous,
powerful expert, Ironwood Zhan, had died in the face of his might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though I was
reincarnated into the mortal world!” Ning growled in his heart.
“Relying on my own efforts, I was still able to become a Xiantian
lifeform! And that was just the beginning! The beginning of myself,
Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experiences of his
past life. Everything he had seen in this one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all allowed
Ning to have a heart that was filled with an incomparable urge to
grow stronger. An urge to control his own destiny. To not be
controlled by others, to not be controlled by fate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just the
start!” Ning took a few steps forward, walking to Zhan’s corpse.
With but a thought, a gust of flame instantly turned Zhan’s corpse
into nothing but ash, leaving behind only an armguard and that
Blackwood Vinewhip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The armguard
and the whip both flew into Ning’s hands. Ning inspected them
carefully. “So this armguard is actually a storage-type magic
treasure! The Blackwood Vinewhip is also a magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” Ning
returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He returned to the
pool, collecting those eight Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation flags.
The flags were all very dark and grey, and yet they emitted pulses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures,
Dao-seals. All of them are only usable when one is at least at the
Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner.” Ning collected all these things
into his kalestone. “I first have to reach the Xiantian level as a
Ki Refiner as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cleaned up the
surrounding area. As for the corpses of the Bi’an Tiger and
Ironwood Zhan, he transformed them all into ash. Ning then once again
continued his meditations by the pool side, because he had the
sense…that training his ki to the Xiantian level would be very
easy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The night after that
battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still sat in the
lotus position by the side of the pool, and for the moment, the
dantian in his body began to change and rumble! The original powerful
threads of ki began to rotate and then condense into liquid drops.
One drop of ki began to solidify, and Ning’s body also began to
attract some mist which wrapped around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I’m about to
break through.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been in the
womb, his meridians had been damaged. If he had been relying on Ki
Refining to reach the Xiantian level, it would have been very hard.
But upon reaching the Xiantian level through the [Scarlet Diagram of
the Ning Shining Heavens], Ning’s entire body had been transformed
into a true Fiendgod’s body by the Lunar Truewater and Solar
Truefire of the Solar Star [Sun] and the Lunar Star [Moon]. Because
his entire body had been transformed, his mortal body had been
transformed into a Fiendgod’s body, and his meridians had been
remade anew as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Currently, Ning’s
meridian network had become perfected and unblemished. The meridian
channels were far wider than that of most Xiantian Ki Refiners! In
addition, Ning had a very high level of enlightenment, so naturally,
he was now about to break through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storage-type
magic treasure.” Ning held the armguard while activating the ki in
his body. He quickly managed to bind it to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Storage-type magic
treasures and natural kalestones really are different.” Ning
instantly felt overjoyed. This armguard held an enormous storage
space. Within an area of chaos, there was a storage area of tens of
meters across. There were many items inside as well, such as clothes,
food, gold, and other things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most valuable items
were those eight Dao-seals! They had been slowly accumulated by
Ironwood Zhan over many years. Today, he had used three of them in
one breath, but he had still died in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity there are no
other magic treasures.” Ning shook his head. Still, this was as he
had expected. A Xiantian lifeform was already quite lucky to have
just two or three magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This bow is pretty
good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a flip of his
hand, Ning retrieved a simple, unadorned greatbow from within the
storage-type magic treasure. “This should be the bow which Ironwood
Zhan normally uses. After reaching the Xiantian level, I am in need
of a good bow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he applied force to
it, the monstrous, Fiendgod-like power he possessed easily drew the
bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good boy.” Ning
praised, then he took a good look at it. The bow had two things drawn
on it that looked like characters; ‘Jia Yong’. This name made
Ning puzzled. “It should be the name of the bowyer who made this
bow, I suppose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I return to the
West Prefecture City, I’ll exchange this Blackwood Vinewhip for
another magic treasure.” Ji Ning collected everything, extremely
happy. “Without experiencing the bone-freezing cold, how could one
experience the fragrant scent of the flowers assailing the nose? Four
years of training the sword. After training to now, I’ve broken
through and am about to enter a brand new world. I suppose this
counts as finally smelling the fragrant scent of the plum blossoms
assailing the nose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This breakthrough
resulted in him reaching the Xiantian level in both ki and as a
Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even his soul had
reached the ‘divine will’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the hint of
understanding regarding the true Dao which he had gained by the side
of the pool had allowed him to develop an ultimate attack, the
‘Waterflame Lotus’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right, and
there’s that!” Ning took a breath, letting himself calm down. As
he did, with great solemnity, he took out the book his mother had
given him, the most precious secret manual his mother possessed,
which she had forbidden him to teach to any other members of the Ji
clan. She had told him that he was only to use it upon reaching the
Xiantian level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully looked
at the golden cover of the book, and those four characters on the
cover: [Wind Wing Evasion Technique]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning opened
the book and began to read.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_6___Returning"></A>
Chapter 6 - Returning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windwing Evasion is
the root and foundation for our Yuchi clan. It is not to be
transmitted to outsiders!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon opening the
gold-leaf pages, this was the very first line of characters, which
caused Ji Ning to be stunned. The Yuchi clan? His mother was Yuchi
Snow. Could this mean that his mother belonged to the Yuchi clan? In
this wide land, those who were born into poor circumstances and
didn’t have a good clan name would just randomly pick names for
themselves, such as ‘Blacktooth’, ‘Blackstone’, ‘Ironhead’,
etc. Generally speaking, only large-scale clans had proper surnames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother has never
mentioned the Yuchi clan to me.” Ning said to himself. “I am
Mother’s child, and I can thus be considered to have the blood of
the Yuchi clan in my veins. But strictly speaking, I am only half a
Yuchi clan member. And yet, Mother still taught this to me. However,
from my birth until today, I have never heard of a Yuchi clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of books
Ning had read could only be described as ‘many’! But the books
had no records of a Yuchi clan, which meant that the Yuchi clan was
not a clan from the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That made sense…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother and Father had
met in the distant Dark North Seas, and then they had gone
adventuring together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never heard
Mother discuss the Yuchi clan. Perhaps Mother left the clan, or
perhaps the Yuchi clan collapsed? Forget it, it doesn’t matter
right now.” Ning lowered his head, continuing to read. This book
explained in detail the history of the [Windwing Evasion] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancestor of the
Yuchi clan, Yuchi Anton, was born a slave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once, when hunting on a
mountain, he had rescued a heavily injured child. He had worked hard
to take care of this child, and the child slowly recovered. Only
after half a year did the child reveal his true identity…as it
turned out, this person who had appeared to be a child was, in
reality, a Celestial Immortal who had trained for countless years and
had long since escaped the Three Realms. This time, he had
encountered a great disaster, and thus he had used all his abilities
in order to flee to this mountain, but by then, he had become
powerless. If he had ran into an ordinary little monstrous beast, he
probably would have been eaten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This child had named
himself Suhuan, and claimed that he had already become an Immortal in
the Fiendgod Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, this Immortal
named Suhuan had taught Anton training methods. Who would have
thought that Anton was actually more talented in Fiendgod Body
Refining methods…Suhuan had stayed by Anton’s side for fully a
hundred years, carefully teaching him, while at the same time
transmitting to him a divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion]. And
then, Suhuan had said, “Our karmic destiny has come to its end. I
hope you will shape up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, he had flown
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal?”
Ning was shocked. “Divine ability?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This…this….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even in the Netherworld
Kingdom, according to what the Lord of Cui Manor had said the
celestial soldiers and generals of the Heaven Realm, after acquiring
the likes of the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique, would have
to experience countless tribulations before becoming a Celestial
Immortal! In the Grand Xia Dynasty, perhaps a million years would
pass without a single Celestial Immortal being born. They truly were
creatures who had transcended the Three Realms, who were no longer
bound by the restrictions of the Netherworld Kingdom or of the
Heavenly Court. They were Immortals who did as they pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who would have
thought that the ancestor of Mother’s Yuchi clan would have had a
history like this.” Ning felt shaken. “This history is far more
incredible than our Ji clan’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, the
[Windwing Evasion] is a divine ability!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t
breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What was a ‘divine
ability’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the more famous
divine abilities, included the ‘Kuafu Sunchaser’, ’72
Transformations’, ‘Three Heads, Six Arms’, ‘Houyi Shooting
the Sun’. These were the natural abilities which the ancient,
mighty Fiendgods had developed. Only these abilities could be
described as ‘divine abilities’! Only Fiendgod Body Refiners
could train in them, and only upon reaching the Zifu level could they
begin their training!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single ‘divine
ability’ was incomparably precious. Many Fiendgod Body Refiners,
upon reaching the Zifu Disciple level, were clearly capable of
learning divine abilities, but they didn’t have any chance to do
so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine abilities
should only be usable at the Zifu stage. But Mother instructed me to
begin learning at the Xiantian stage. Why is that?” Ning continued
to read the detailed information regarding the training methods for
the [Windwing Evasion].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flipping through the
golden pages, another golden page appeared before him, but clearly,
this golden page was somewhat different from the previous pages. This
golden page still had a hint of stellar light glowing from it, and
there was a diagram engraved at the top of it. It was that of a giant
Roc in flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At times, it stretched
its wings. At times, it sank down. At times, it flew throughout the
Nine Heavens. At times, it sank into the seas. At times, it landed on
the ground. At times, it burrowed deep into the earth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel affected by this diagram. It was as though he had seen an
enormous Roc in flight. In addition, the great Roc in this diagram
was covered by countless specks of stellar light, and these specks of
stellar light…seemed like the divine power flowing through the
critical parts of the great Roc’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spots of light
seemed to be focused on a pair of wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The great Roc
spreads his wings, and travels a hundred thousand kilometers as it
flies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is what Master
Suhuan told to me. Unfortunately, I am far too distant from that
level. The descendants of my Yuchi clan must focus on training in
this [Windwing Evasion] technique. I hope that one day, one of them
will be able to reach the highest ‘divine ability’ level. The
eighty one Roc diagrams of the [Windwing Evasion] has profound
secrets hidden within it. It must be meditated upon! The benefits to
it are boundless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Windwing
Evasion] is divided into multiple layers and levels. Once the divine
power in one’s body reaches the level of being able to condense
into a pair of wings, only then can one be considered to have
developed a ‘divine ability’. However, the [Windwing Evasion]
remains a divine technique, and it would be jealously desired by some
extremely powerful tribes of the Grand Xia Dynasty. The descendants
of my clan absolutely must use wing-type magic treasures alongside
this divine ability. Thus, not only can they rely on the power of the
magic treasures to fly even faster, they can also prevent others from
knowing of the existence of this divine ability…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after a long time
was he able to calm down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mother truly does
have an extraordinary background.” Ning frowned. “But clearly,
although each page of this book is golden, the paper of those eighty
one Roc diagrams are different from that of the other pages. In
addition, such miraculous diagrams were most likely left behind by
that Immortal, Suhuan, himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Suhuan,
despite teaching the [Windwing Evasion], most likely only left a
single copy. In other words, the Yuchi clan should only have a single
secret manual!” Ning hypothesized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was his
first time viewing the eighty one Roc diagrams, Ning felt extremely
certain that these eighty one Roc diagrams did indeed contain
boundless secrets. It was the same feeling he had when he was gaining
insights into the Dao…the feeling of immeasurably deep secrets.
Most likely, only a person who had reached the highest levels of
training in this divine ability was able to carve and draw them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor Yuchi only
had a single copy of this secret manual, but my mother is in
possession of it.” Ning pondered. “Can it be that the Yuchi clan
was destroyed? Or was there another reason?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he felt
somewhat worried for his mother’s relatives, he had never had any
attachments to the Yuchi clan, and so Ning quickly stopped thinking
about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to carefully
meditate on this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The moon hanging high
above him, Ning quietly sat down by the side of the pond, flipping
through and looking at the Roc diagrams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Windwing Evasion]
was divided into many different levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after one’s
divine power was able to form wings could one be considered to have
developed a divine ability. However, the requirements for divine
power were very high; only a Zifu Disciple was capable of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mother had me
begin to read it at the Xiantian level.” Ning laughed. “Although
I’m not able to use divine power to form wings, the eighty one Roc
diagrams contain boundless, endless secrets and mysteries. After I
gain insight into them, it will still be very beneficial to my body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already gained
a hint of the true meaning of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher one’s
level of enlightenment was, the more easily one would be able to tell
that the eighty one Roc diagrams contained boundless truths, and even
more infinite mysteries. Naturally, he would meditate on them
intensively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow fell.
The Moon Rabbit rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day passed after
another. Ning remained within that mountain forest, completely
focused on the [Windwing Evasion]. His body flashed through the
mountain forests time and time again, and his movements took him
farther and farther each time, at faster and faster speeds, with
greater ease each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
trained here for over a month.” Ning suddenly came to his senses as
he stared at the sun in the sky. “If I don’t go back, most likely
Autumn Leaf and the others will frantically report back to West
Prefecture City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile
on his face. Turning to glance at the surrounding area, he saw that
the pool was as calm as ever, and the aquatic grass in the pool still
continued to slowly drift about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past month or
so, I’ve improved dramatically.” Ning felt incomparably
delighted. Whether in Ki, as a Fiendgod, his soul, or even his newly
learned divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion], he had improved
greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly leapt
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like a blurry image, or
like a bird in flight, he instantly flew over a kilometer away. His
speed was now faster than when Ironwood Zhan had simultaneously used
the ‘Light Body Seal’ and the ‘Divine Movement Seal’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a desolate tribe
within the wilderness, there were many overturned stone rooms. The
tribe was in a state of desolation. Clearly, the tribesmen had all
departed long ago. This was an abandoned place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But at the edges of the
tribe, there were a few dozen stone houses that were absolutely
spotless, where a group of black armored guards were gathered
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was seated
on a stone bench, quietly staring into the distance while waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, due to the
appearance of the Diremonster, Serpentwing, at Serpentwing Lake, Ji
Ning had immediately led Autumn Leaf and Mowu out of the Metalstone
Tribue…but after the Serpentwing event had died down, Ning had
permitted Autumn Leaf and Mowu to temporarily stay here with these
black armored guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The territory which the
Ji clan ruled over was simply too vast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, they had squads
of black armored guards scattered throughout their domain. Whenever
they were needed, they could immediately congregate while shocking
and overawing countless tribes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf stood up in surprised delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those black armored
guards and Mowu also turned to look. They saw from the distance a
blurry figure appeared in a flash within those ruined tribal houses,
then smile and walk towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Autumn Leaf
was slightly startled. She could tell that her young master, who was
walking towards her from afar, was somewhat different. His entire
body seemed to radiate a familiar aura, as though the essence of the
heavens and the earth were within him! But of course, only she, who
had been by Ning’s side since he was young, was able to notice many
of these little qualitative changes in Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Mowu stepped forward to pay his respects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
nearby group of black armored guards all fell to one knee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations. It is time for me to head back.” Ji Ning laughed as
he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
startled. “Go? Go back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First to Serpentwing
Lake.” Ning’s eyes had a hint of anticipation flash through them.
On this adventuring trip, he had decided long ago that upon breaking
through and becoming a Xiantian lifeform, he would go deal with
Serpentwing. Although Serpentwing had currently broken through to the
peak Xiantian level, Ning was still completely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, you…”
Autumn Leaf revealed a look of surprise and delight. Naturally, she
knew that Ning planned to go deal with Serpentwing as soon as he
broke through to the Xiantian lifeform level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
extremely cautious. She didn’t say anything, only nodded
repeatedly. “Mowu, hurry, gather our things. We’re heading out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Autumn Leaf, and
Mowu, riding three black beasts, departed this ruined tribe.

Chapter 7 - Blacktooth Tribe
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the desolate
grasslands, three black beasts were galloping at high speed. Ning and
the others had looks of irrepressible joy on their faces. No matter
what, they were finally coming home from the border region of
Eastmount Marsh. They drew closer and closer to West Prefecture city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young Master.”
Autumn Leaf called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ji Ning
looked towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf hurriedly
said, “On this trip to Serpentwing Lake, we’ll pass by Spring
Grass’ Blacktooth Tribe. How about let’s go visit her at the
Blacktooth Tribe? It has been a long time since I’ve seen her. I
miss her very much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass?”
Ning was startled, and in his heart, a surge of longing arose as
well. Autumn Leaf and Spring Grass had accompanied him ever since he
was young. They were like sisters to him. Originally, despite being
unwilling to part from her, he didn’t want to cause Spring Grass to
feel sorrow, which was why he permitted her to be with her father
again. Now that Spring Grass was suddenly mentioned, Ning couldn’t
help but feel a hint of excitement as well as anticipation. “Alright.
Let’s go pay a visit on the way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master.” Autumn Leaf hurriedly said with gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to go as
well.” Ning smiled, and as he did, he slapped the black beast on
its head, ordering it to change directions slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although in theory they
were paying a visit to the Blacktooth Tribe ‘enroute’ to
Serpentwing Lake, in truth, it was still something of a long detour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a rather open
mountain cave below a mountain wall, with many large wooden fences
nearby. There were some armors hung up in the mouth of the cave,
while there were also some long-furred beasts strung up on the trees.
Some powerfully built men, their upper bodies bare, were casually
chatting while seated, roasting the flesh of a beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the cave entrance,
ten black armored guards were on watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is coming.”
One of the black armored guards called out loudly, and those men who
were eating turned to look. One of them, a bare-chested man, stood up
and walked over, frowning slightly as he looked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three figures made
their way over at high speed from within the mountain forests. Seeing
that it was three people riding black beasts, they immediately
relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bare-chested man’s
face immediately changed, and he hurriedly calld out, “The young
master has arrived, so why haven’t you paid your respects yet?
Quick quick quick, all of you, rise!” After speaking, he
immediately rushed forward, coming down to one knee at the entrance.
Very respectfully, he called out, “Young master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the armored men as
well as the men with bared chests all came over and knelt down while
calling out, “Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rise.” With a
flip, Ning descended from the black beast, laughing at the leader of
these black armored guards. “You’ve met me before?” He had been
preparing to take out his insignia just now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Wuzhan, was lucky
in the past.” The heroic figure had a scarred face, and his body
was powerfully built. “Young master, in the past, when you sparred
with Ninefang Warriors, I once sparred with you, young master. Thus,
I was instantly able to recognize you, young master. Behind you
should be that Miss Autumn Leaf, your maidservant, young master. I
recognize her as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So that was the reason
why. In the past, he often sparred with Ninefang Warriors, and many
of the Ninefang Warriors of the black armored guards had sparred with
him. It wasn’t strange for him to meet one of them stationed
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to ask you
about something.” Ning said. “It has to do with Serpentwing Lake.
Come. Let’s talk inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” This Captain
Wuzhan immediately said. “Young master, please come with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuzhan guided Ning
inside, towards a spacious stone room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A while ago,
Serpentwing ran amok not too far from us. Even we suffered some
repercussions.” Wuzhan let out a laughing breath. At this time,
another black armored guard came over with a plate of fruits. Ning
casually picked up a fruit and took two bites. “He even came to
your place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. If he had, we’d
have been dead for sure.” Wuzhan shook his head. “However, at the
time, we were all terrified. In the face of Serpentwing, we black
armored guards wouldn’t be able to fight back at all. Although we
managed to avoid that calamity, many tribes suffered disasters. I can
only use the word ‘miserable’ to describe what happened to them!
At that time, we were hoping that Serpentwing would be executed by
our Ji clan, but unfortunately…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Poisondove
Ridge had interceded and engaged in negotiations with the Ji clan,
with the result being that Serpentwing only had to be confined within
Serpentwing Lake for a century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has Serpentwing been
in Serpentwing Lake the entire time?” Ning asked. “Also, is he at
the bottom of Serpentwing Lake, or in the central island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bottom of the
lake, of course.” Wuzhan said hurriedly. “How could he dare to
stay on the island? He is afraid that our Ji clan will act against
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bottom of the lake?”
Ning seemed to have thought of something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed that it
wouldn’t be so easy for him to kill Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wuzhan.” Ning
asked. “Do you know of a tribe known as the Blacktooth Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacktooth Tribe?”
Wuzhan nodded. “I know them, of course I know them. The leader of
the Blacktooth Tribe is a very skillful man. He was able to found a
new tribe. No ordinary person is capable of founding a new tribe.
Unfortunately, the many tribes which Serpentwing harmed had the
Blacktooth Tribe amongst their number.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Ning’s
face changed dramatically. His heart shuddered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Could it be…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what he knew,
originally, even before Serpentwing attacked him, Serpentwing had
destroyed a small tribe. Everyone in the tribe had died. In the end,
it was only through the examination of the corpses of those poor
victims that it was determined that Serpentwing was the killer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does the Blacktooth
Tribe still exist?” Ning asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does.” Wuzhan
nodded. “This time, Serpentwing caused disaster everywhere. He’d
go to a tribe, engage in some slaughter, then leave! It didn’t try
to wipe out everyone! After all, to exterminate an entire tribe would
take more time and make it easier for our Ji clan’s Xiantian
lifeforms to catch up. But although the Blacktooth Tribe wasn’t
wiped out, more than half of its tribesmen died. It really is
terrible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over half?” Ning’s
heart began to clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know Spring
Grass?” Ning hurriedly asked. “My maidservant, Spring Grass. Is
she still alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass?”
Wuzhan said questioningly. “I know Spring Grass. You have two
maidservants, young master. Can it be that Spring Grass is no longer
following you, young master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had released
Spring Grass to her freedom, but very few people knew this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. I granted her
freedom. She is the daughter of the chief of the Blacktooth Tribe.”
Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know about
this.” Wuzhan shook his head. “Although I’ve seen Blacktooth, I
don’t know anything about his daughter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Worry!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Concern!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half the
people of the Blacktooth Tribe had died. Too many had died. Perhaps
Spring Grass was amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely, she
definitely has to be alright.” Ning ground his teeth, then
immediately left the stone room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside, Autumn Leaf
and Mowu were currently seated in a circle with the black armored
guards, enjoying some roast meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf and Mowu both turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
hurriedly shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and Mowu’s
gazes were filled with puzzlement. Why were they leaving in such a
hurry? However, they didn’t dare ask too much. They hurriedly rose,
no longer eating as they headed towards their black beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the Blacktooth
Tribe.” Ning’s face was gloomy. Kicking the waist of the black
beast, he immediately sent it bounding forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black beasts
quickly charged into the distant mountain forests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, what
happened?” The other black armored guards were extremely puzzled.
As for Wuzhan, as he walked out of the stone room, he too frowned as
he stared into the distance. “Spring Grass? The daughter of the
chief of the Blacktooth Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
blazing with worry. Autumn Leaf and Spring Grass, although nominally
his servants, were in truth like big sisters to him. He still
remembered how when he was young, he would point at the words on the
books and stammer out questions. At that time, Spring Grass and
Autumn Leaf, despite being ‘tormented’ by their young master,
could only obediently reply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way she’s
dead.” Ning was extremely worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf asked with concern. “What’s wrong?” She could tell
that her young master’s face was exceedingly ugly right now. She
rarely saw her young master look so furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shouted, “The
Blacktooth Tribe suffered an attack by Serpentwing. More than half
its tribesmen died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Autumn Leaf
was instantly shocked. “Then Spring Grass…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll know once we
get there.” Ning shouted back coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black beasts
moved at high speed. By the time the sun was beginning to set, the
three black beasts arrived at a sparsely covered mountain forest.
From the distance, they could faintly see a tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.” Ning
shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three beasts
quickly came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master?”
Autumn Leaf’s face was red with worry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go over there.”
Ning pointed into the distance. From the distance, dozens of fur-clad
men were currently chopping down trees using hatchets. They were most
likely collecting firewood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should be the
clansmen of the Blacktooth Tribe. If we ask them, we’ll know.”
Ning immediately rode his black beast over, with Autumn Leaf and Mowu
following from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning arrived in front
of those dozens of fur-clad woodcutters. These men all raised their
spears and sabers, carefully watching them approach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a question
for you.” With a flip of his hand, Ning immediately brought out his
insignia, which had a single character on it; ‘Ji’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These tribesmen were
all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does your tribe had
a person named Spring Grass? She is the daughter of your chief.”
Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The chief’s
daughter?” A one-eyed man hurriedly said. “Our Blacktooth Tribe
doesn’t have anyone known as Spring Grass. Our chief’s daughter
is named Miwa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled, then
he hurriedly said, “Right, her name is Miwa. Is she still alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miwa’s dead.”
The tribesmen all said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed
dramatically, and the face of the nearby Autumn Leaf turned utterly
white. Her body swayed, and then she collapsed from her black beast.
Mowu hurriedly leapt off of his own black beast and caught Autumn
Leaf. Autumn Leaf’s face was pale and utterly without color. Her
tears had already begun to flow down uncontrollably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did she die?”
Ning shouted. “Was it Serpentwing who killed her?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing killed
many of the tribesmen of our tribe. Even one of the chief’s son
died.” The one-eyed man said. “Many of our tribesmen died right
away, while a few others suffered from shrapnel from exploding rocks
which smashed into their body, or were frozen…they didn’t die
right away, but they were injured. Afterwards, their wounds festered,
while others became extremely ill. All of them held on, but
eventually died. Many badly injured tribesmen died like that. Miwa,
as well, died of illness afterwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass!”
Autumn Leaf wailed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face became
all the more terrible, and the mental waves generated by his violent
thoughts caused the nearby trees to begin to shake and vibrate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!” Ning
ground his teeth and howled, “I, Ji Ning, so swear that I will
definitely kill you! I will definitely kill you!!!”

Chapter 8 - Spring Grass
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dozens of tribesmen
looked at this youth, feeling a sudden terror. They felt as though
the entire world around them was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill Serpentwing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth in front of
them was going to kill Serpentwing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You didn’t lie to
me.” Ji Ning swept this group of tribesmen with his gaze. “Miwa
truly died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why would we lie?
The entire Blacktooth Tribe knows this.” The group of experts were
filled with terror and panic. Whether it was due to this youth’s
aura or the ‘Ji’ insignia he held, they were in terror of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning mounted his black
beast and began to head straight into the distant Blacktooth Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and Mowu
mounted their own black beasts and followed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than
ten tribal warriors standing guard on the two archer towers on each
side of the fence gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsiders, halt.”
A warrior immediately shouted angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His face sunken, Ning
took out his insignia and shouted back, “Tell Blacktooth to come
see me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
insignia, the warrior above were terrified and quickly called out,
“Please wait, I’ll go inform the chief right away.” As he
spoke, the warrior jumped down directly to the ground, then began to
fly towards the tribe. In but a few moments, a black fur clad,
scarred man ran in their direction, under escort of a number of
warriors. It was the chief of the Blacktooth Tribe, Chief Blacktooth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he saw the three
figures mounted on black beasts, especially the leader, his body
suddenly trembled. He immediately howled, “Quick, open the gate and
welcome the young master of the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master of the
Ji clan?” The people of a small clan like the Blacktooth Tribe
naturally were shocked. They hurriedly began to open the heavy gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth was the
first to fall to his knees. “Blacktooth pays his respect to you,
young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other tribal
warriors all knelt down as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To your residence.”
Ning remained on his black beast as he gave the instruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Blacktooth
quickly led the way up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at
Blacktooth. He couldn’t help but feel a hint of hatred in his
heart! He knew that Spring Grass’ death couldn’t be blamed on
Blacktooth, and he believed that Blacktooth was heartbroken as well.
But Ning couldn’t help but feel hatred and pain…originally, when
he had given Spring Grass into her father’s care, he had never
imagined that she would die, just like this. If Spring Grass had
remained by his side…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s left hand
couldn’t help but clench into a fist. Even his knuckles were
turning white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, this
is my residence.” Blacktooth arrived at one of larger stone houses
of the tribe. There were two women and a young child at the doorway.
These two women and the child were clearly cautious and uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is?” Ning
looked at the young child. This child looked very similar to Spring
Grass…causing a pang in Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My son.”
Blacktooth said respectfully, while at the same time, barking to his
women and his son, “Why haven’t you left yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two women and the
child immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak inside. Mowu,
you stand guard at the doorway. Don’t let anyone in.” Ning
immediately dismounted his black beast and led Autumn Leaf into the
house. Blacktooth, terrified, followed him in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at
Blacktooth, sitting down on a stone chair and saying coldly,
“Blacktooth, when I gave Spring Grass into your care, my hope was
that the two of you, father and daughter, would be reunited and live
a good life! But why is it that I didn’t see Spring Grass upon
entering the tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth hurriedly
said, “Young master, right now, Spring Grass isn’t within the
tribe!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not within the
tribe?” Ning frowned as he stared accusingly at Blacktooth.
Blacktooth still wanted to lie about it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon after Spring
Grass returned to the tribe, she encountered a young travelling
merchant whom she took a liking to. I knew that travelling merchant,
so I had faith in him.” Blacktooth said in a very practiced manner.
“When one’s daughter grows up, she will have to get married.
Thus, I had my daughter marry this travelling merchant. Before Spring
Grass left with this travelling merchant…she left a letter for you,
young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this last
sentence, Ning was beginning to grow truly angry as he listened.
Blacktooth, you dare deceive me! But upon hearing this last sentence,
Ning said softly, “Letter?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll get it now.”
Blacktooth hurriedly ran into a nearby room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master?”
Autumn Leaf looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said softly,
“Don’t be impatient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s intelligence
wasn’t low. He wasn’t an idiot who only knew how to train. From
the intelligence he had gathered….there was no question that Spring
Grass had died! First of all, all of the people outside the tribe
were in total agreement, and they even said that Ning could ask
anyone in the tribe and would still get this answer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no reason for
that group of people to deceive him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Also…after having
been separated from her father for so long, Spring Grass had wanted
to be with him so much that she had even left Ning! How could she
immediately get married and leave not long after reuniting with her
father?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, this
is the letter Spring Grass left for you.” Blacktooth held a white
beast skin parchment and handed it over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath. Letter? This was most likely her will. The will which Spring
Grass had intentionally left behind amidst her grave illness…Ning
stretched out his trembling hand and accepted the white beast skin,
opening it and reading carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those graceful
characters appeared. These characters were very familiar to him. Upon
seeing them, Ning’s heart instantly shook. It was Spring Grass’
handwriting!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, after
returning to the tribe, I was truly very happy, very happy. I saw my
father, and I even have two little brothers…I feel as though I did
when I was a child, when I was with my parents….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is what the letter
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The letter included all
of the joy which Spring Grass had felt. Ning could sense the joy
emanating from these words. Spring Grass truly had been happy when
she returned to the tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two little
brothers?” Ning had a thought. Previously, he had only seen a
single son of Blacktooth’s, while previously the clansman had
said…when Serpentwing had run amok, more than half of the
Blacktooth Tribe had died, including the son of the chief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I met him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single woman
has a man who is destined for her. As soon as I saw him, I knew that
he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see him
frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I stand
there and watch. Just looking at him is a gift given by heaven. Thus,
I decided…to marry him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clearly saw that
there was a splotch here, as though left behind by a tear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Marry?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was the man which
Spring Grass spoke of actually himself? As soon as I saw him, I knew
that he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see
him frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I
stand there and watch….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to marry
me, why didn’t you say it to me yourself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes,
unable to prevent the tears from flowing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Spring Grass
was only a maidservant, most of the men in this area would marry
quite a few women. In his previous life, Ning hadn’t loved any
woman. In this life, he had quickly become accustomed to this
culture. Even if he truly married several women, that wouldn’t be a
big deal. But they had to be women which he dearly loved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would have been
willing to nod and agree to letting Spring Grass become his woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master!” The
nearby Autumn Leaf saw that Ning was shedding tears. Her heart
couldn’t help but clench. She had been a maidservant since she was
young. Naturally, she wouldn’t read a letter while Ning was reading
it. But when she saw Ning cry…Autumn Leaf’s heart became
panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, if you
can see this letter, that means you came to the Blacktooth Tribe to
see me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really am very
happy, very happy. Spring Grass is just a maidservant. For you, young
master, to come to the Blacktooth Tribe to visit Spring Grass means
at least…Spring Grass has a small place of her own in your heart,
young master…Spring Grass is very happy, very happy, truly, very
happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The letter concluded
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were wet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very happy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Are you truly very
happy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Ning
laughed loudly. His laugh was so sorrowful. This was someone who had
been with him his entire life, like family.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf was worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Blacktooth was terrified and uneasy as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to stare at
Blacktooth, his eyes as sharp as swords. He growled, “Blacktooth,
you still want to try and deceive me? Speak, tell me, tell me
everything!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this,
Blacktooth’s face changed dramatically. And then his body began to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth’s knees
hit the ground. His entire body shook in agony, and for a long time,
he let out a desolate, heartbroken cry. “Miwaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Riverside Tribe
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grief that had been
suppressed for so long but which was given sudden release….how
powerful it was! Ji Ning stood there quietly, looking at the agonized
Blacktooth, not saying a single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you already
know, young master, then I won’t lie any more. Young master, come
with me.” Blacktooth rose and walked out of the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Autumn Leaf
followed behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth led the way
in front, all the way towards the very back of the tribe. In the very
back of the tribe, there was a small door in the wooden fence.
Through the wooden door…there was a cemetery far past it. Many of
the erected tombs were newly made. Clearly, this was a freshly built
cemetery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master?”
Autumn Leaf looked towards Ning, her eyes filled with a hint of
unease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his breath as
well. He understood where Blacktooth was taking him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right here.”
Blacktooth pointed at a seemingly ordinary grave. In front of this
grave, there was a large stone, which had just a few words carved
into it: ‘Daughter, Miwa. Erected by Father, Blacktooth.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass.”
Ning quietly stood there, looking at the grave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his life, he had
rarely experienced the sensation of heartbreak. Compared to those
strong, powerful emotions, Ning preferred calm, quiet, warm emotions.
The feeling of seeing someone every morning, and affection for each
other slowly growing deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Calm and peaceful was
real!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To treat someone as
part of your own life. At least in this life, from when he was an
infant until now, the amount of time Spring Grass had spent with him
was most likely even greater than his parents had. Ning hadn’t
realized it when she was alive, but now that he knew she was dead, he
felt as though a piece of his heart had been chopped off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It hurt very much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacktooth.” Ning
stood there, looking at the tombstone. Slowly, he said, “Tell me
everything. Tell me everything which happened after Spring Grass
returned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At first, on the way
back, she was actually quite sad. Sad that she had to part with you,
young master.” Blacktooth sighed. “But after she arrived at the
tribe and saw her two brothers, Miwa clearly became much happier.
She’d often spend time with her two little brothers…the days
passed in happiness, and at that time, Miwa had looked forward to
young master one day coming to visit her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth’s voice
sunk. “One day, Serpentwing arrived. It was like a nightmare,
causing countless members of our tribe to die, one of which was my
son, Waterfront.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The death of
Waterfront, her little brother, hurt Miwa very much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remembered that
beast skin letter which discussed some of the events Miwa had
experienced upon returning to the Blacktooth Tribe. Many were stories
regarding her and her two little brothers. Clearly, Miwa truly doted
on her two little brothers. This caused Ning to quietly come to the
decision that he would have to help out Spring Grass’ sole
surviving brother, as a way to help console Miwa’s soul in heaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing’s
attack caused the entire Blacktooth Tribe to fall into an abyss of
fear and pain! The tribesmen were afraid, afraid that Serpentwing
could attack again. Some of the tribesmen even fled the tribe and
joined other, larger tribes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the
tribe was in a state of panic.” Blacktooth continued, “Many
tribesmen would leave. Actually, after Serpentwing’s attack, our
tribe’s population became less than a thousand. With so many
tribesmen fleeing…if this continued, the Blacktooth Tribe would
have fallen apart soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had undergone
countless difficulties in order to build the tribe. Naturally, I
didn’t want it to fall apart just like that.” Blacktooth said.
“Spring Grass felt sympathy for me, so she put down her
embarrassment and wrote a letter and asked the tribesmen to deliver
it to West Prefecture City to give it to you, young master. She
wanted to ask you, young master, to help my Blacktooth Tribe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only, we quickly
received the news that you, young master, were out adventuring.”
Blacktooth shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had gone adventuring
long before Serpentwing had reached the peak of the Xiantian stage.
Naturally, they wouldn’t have been able to find him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tribesmen
suggested that our Blacktooth Tribe should consider go asking for the
protection of that extremely large tribe, the ‘Riverside Tribe’.”
Blacktooth said in a dark voice. “As long as we could receive the
protection of the Riverside Tribe and be permitted to temporarily
reside within Riverside City, everything would be fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Riverside City?”
Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As one of the hegemons
of the Swallow Mountain area, the Ji clan naturally had to control
the many tribes within this territory. No tribe’s population was
permitted to expand beyond fifty thousand! Once they expanded beyond
fifty thousand, they might become a threat to the Ji clan’s rule.
Thus, if that happened, the Ji clan would definitely use some brutal,
ruthless methods to overawe the surrounding tribes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, a fifty thousand
man tribe was considered an extremely large tribe. The Riverside
Tribe was one such tribe! Because the tribe was large, the walls of
the tribe were made from enormous rocks, like a small city. Although
it couldn’t compare to a large city like the West Prefecture City
which held hundreds of thousands of citizens, it was still an
extremely powerful tribe amongst the countless tribes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
tribes that were able to erect such a city had a Xiantian lifeform
guarding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Riverside City had
two powerful Xiantian lifeforms. Diremonsters wouldn’t dare go
there.” Blacktooth said. “Our Blacktooth Tribe only had a few
hundred people. As long as we could enter Riverside City! Once
Serpentwing was dealt with, everything would then return to normal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We went to pay our
respects to a powerful figure within Riverside City, River He, and
offered treasures, wanting him to accept our Blacktooth Tribe hide
within for a time.” Blacktooth ground his teeth. “But that River
He was very picky. He didn’t have any interest in those treasures
we offered. But he took an interest in Miwa.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wanted Miwa to
become his woman, and in exchange, he would help the Blacktooth Tribe
this time. You know how haughty Miwa is. Of course she didn’t
accept. She immediately left!” A ferocious look flashed through
Blacktooth’s eyes. “That River He actually sent his subordinates
to go capture Miwa, wanting to forcibly take her back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, Miwa was
very powerful, and she used very high class sword techniques as well.
She beat Jiang He’s servants half to death…Miwa had also said at
the time, ‘My master is the young master of the Ji clan. Jiang He,
don’t go too far!’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Jiang He just
laughed loudly and said, ‘Even if you are the maidservant of young
master Ji, you are just a female servant. If you were able to
successfully ask your young master for help, then you wouldn’t come
here asking me for help. What’s more, how could the maidservant of
a young master of the Ji clan end up in such a small tribe?’”
Blacktooth ground his teeth. “This Jiang He added another
sentence…‘If you become my woman, I will protect the Blacktooth
Tribe! Otherwise, just wait for death.’ After this, we left
Riverside City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf, hearing
this, was enraged. “How could Sister Spring Grass possibly agree to
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass
wouldn’t agree.” Ning shook his head while looking at Blacktooth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Spring Grass
was completely unwilling.” Blacktooth shook his head in pain. “But
seeing how panicked the tribesmen were and how members of the tribe
often fled, and seeing how agonized I was….for the sake of me, her
father, after agonizing for three days, she still agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could Sister
Spring Grass be so stupid!!!” Autumn Leaf was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could imagine the
mental struggle which Spring Grass had gone through during those
three days. For the sake of her father, was it worth it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miwa became River
He’s woman.” Blacktooth’s voice was trembling slightly. “But
when Miwa was completely unprepared, River He suddenly launched a
sneak attack, smashing Miwa’s dantian with a palm strike and
dispersing all of the ki in her body while mocking her….‘You
stupid woman, there are countless tribes which want to be protected
by my Riverside Tribe. Just because you became my woman, I have to
help you? Hahaha, what a dreamer!’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Detestable!!!”
Autumn Leaf was so angry that she was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass. Oh,
Spring Grass!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did you trust that
bastard? Why did you have to sacrifice yourself for your father? Why?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Serpentwing
affair quickly calmed down. The Ji clan imprisoned Serpentwing within
Serpentwing Lake, causing Serpentwing to not dare to come out at
all.” Blacktooth said. “Once this news came out from the Ji clan,
all the tribes quickly settled down. The hearts of our Blacktooth
Tribe’s tribesmen calmed down as well, and some of the tribesmen
who had fled actually returned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was worried about
Miwa, so I went to look for her.” Blacktooth said in a low voice.
“Only when I went looking for her did I find out the situation had
changed. After using all sorts of methods, I finally managed to have
a private meeting with Miwa. As soon as Miwa saw me, Miwa began to
cry, cry so hard!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could imagine Spring
Grass’s agony, regret, and heartbreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She said that this
was her own mistake. It was her own stupidity, and that it wasn’t
the fault of myself, her father. She had willingly done this.”
Blacktooth said in agony. “She also said…she didn’t want you,
young master, to learn of this. She didn’t want to make you feel
heartbroken, which is why she concocted this story of her marrying a
travelling merchant, which she left for you in that letter she gave
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After giving me the
letter, Miwa died. She took poison.” Blacktooth said softly. “I
knew how much agony my daughter was in. Death was perhaps a type of
release. Actually, when she died, she was murmuring your name. She
didn’t want you to know why she died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having been with
each other for so long, how could he not understand what Spring Grass
was thinking?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She wanted that happy,
cheerful Spring Grass to live on in Ning’s heart….she didn’t
want Ning to learn of the humiliations she had suffered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single woman
has a man who is destined for her. As soon as I saw him, I knew that
he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see him
frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I stand
there and watch. Just looking at him is a gift given by heaven…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really am very
happy, very happy. Spring Grass is just a maidservant. For you, young
master, to come to the Blacktooth Tribe to visit Spring Grass means
at least…Spring Grass has a small place of her own in your heart,
young master…Spring Grass is very happy, very happy, truly, very
happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes,
tears faintly visible within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He quietly walked
towards the tombstone, sitting down in front of him. Holding a bamboo
tube in his hands, he said softly, “Spring Grass, in the past, you
always poured wine for me. It is my turn to pour wine for you.” The
wine within the bamboo tube dripped onto the ground in front of the
tombstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know. I
understand. I know that you are forever the happy Spring Grass,
forever happy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your stupidity truly
is adorable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, but his
eyes were filled with tears. “I know what happened to you, but I
don’t look upon you. How could a little brother look down on his
big sister? Although sometimes his big sister might be a bit
stupid…you will always be the big sister of Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing the words, ‘big
sister’, the nearby Autumn Leaf’s lips trembled, and she let out
a whimper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sis, you were too
tired. Sleep, sleep, have a good sleep.” Ning said softly. “Those
people who took advantage of you, sis, those people who caused you to
be heartbroken…I won’t spare any of them. Not one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put down the
bamboo tube and rose. “Let’s go to the Riverside Tribe. I am
going to meet this River He!”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riding on his black
beast, Ji Ning and the other two left the Blacktooth Tribe at high
speed, disappearing into the distant mountain forests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chief?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are they
going?” The tribesmen at the gate asked, but Blacktooth simply
stood there, watching as Ning and the other two left. Shaking his
head, Blacktooth said, “Don’t know.” But a look of anticipation
through his eyes. He knew…that this young master of the Ji clan was
going to the Riverside Tribe to get revenge for his daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But given the status of
the Riverside Tribe, would this young master of the Ji clan be able
to do so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if young master
Ji isn’t able to get revenge, his father, the Raindrop Sword, Ji
Yichuan, definitely is.” Blacktooth’s heart was filled with
hatred. He truly hated River He, but unfortunately, his own strength
was insufficient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Riverside Tribe was
hundreds of kilometers away from the Blacktooth Tribe, and mountains
lay in the way. Only when the sun rose on the next day did they
arrive at the Riverside Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single nearby
tribe was living within the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A place where over
fifty thousand tribesmen were living…this was essentially a city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, come
over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, go on in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go on through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armored guards at
the gate inspected the items of the people entering the city. The
Riverside Tribe had enemies, and they were concerned about people
possibly smuggling in large amounts of siege bows and other such
weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh? You three!”
Suddenly, an armored guard saw three black armored beasts galloping
over at high speed. Seeing that they didn’t seem to have any
intentions on slowing down, he immediately shouted, “Quickly come
to a halt. If you charge through the gate of our Riverside City, we
will release arrows.” Instantly, the archers above on the guard
tower nocked their bows. They wouldn’t show any mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who had been
seated on the back of that black east, suddenly flew into the air,
charging onto the top of that enormous city wall. And then, a surging
wave of invisible energy instantly swept outwards. The dozens of
armored guards that were originally on top of the city guard tower
felt their bodies suddenly sway, and then they smashed downwards out
of the guard tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning was the
only person standing atop the guard tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those armored guards
fell down, all of their faces grimy with dirt, and some of the
unluckier ones even had bones broken. However, these were all
powerful, valiant warriors. They normally wouldn’t be injured much
just from falling down from the top of the city walls. They only were
now because they had been caught off guard by that energy wave which
had knocked them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He, he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of armored
guards stared at Ji Ning, standing atop the city walls, and then
looked at their empty hands. Hurriedly, they moved to pick up the
bows that had fallen onto the ground as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing atop the city
walls, Ning stared into the city and let out an enraged bellow,
“River He, I order you to come out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He, I order
you to come out!” “River He, I order you to come out!” “River
He, I order you to come out!” ….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This furious bellow
that seemed to have come from a Fiendgod exploded forth like thunder.
The guards that had been nearby the city walls as well as some
passer-byers all clapped their hands to their ears in pain, and some
of them even began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The furious roar echoed
throughout every location of the entire Riverside City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face was dark.
With a massive kick, an enormous exploding sound was heard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DONG!” An enormous
wall like this one which was six or seven meters thick was extremely
durable, but thanks to Ning’s kick, it began to vibrate powerfully.
One giant crack after another began to appear on the tall, powerful
city wall, and some distortions and cracks even began to appear in
the ground below it. This kick had caused even the ground nearby to
ripple and shake as though the ground was a pool of water, and those
armored guards were so terrified that they hurriedly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DONG!” Ning
delivered yet another kick!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby earth began
to shudder yet again, and a large number of cracks had now appeared
within the wall. Many stones began to tumble down, and the stone
guard tower itself began to shudder, as though preparing to crack at
any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DONG!” Ning
delivered one final kick!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The city wall which was
already covered with countless cracks finally collapsed. Many
boulders came falling down. Instantly, the massive city gate became a
pile of rubble. The tall, massive city walls fell downwards towards
the street. This scene of rubble lying everywhere caused those
armored guards and civilians who had run away long ago to stare in
shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My God…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The city towers…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them could
believe it. The walls of the main gate to a city were the thickest,
most stable parts of the city. Even siege machines would at most
attack the gates. Attacking the city walls would be entirely useless.
That seamless, tough stone that was six or seven meters thick….even
if a person slashed down onto it with a knife, at most a scar would
be left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kicking down the city
walls with just three kicks?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and Mowu,
riding their black beasts, quickly arrived at the area of rubble. By
now, Ning had already landed on the rubble as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi was current
seated in the lotus position within a quiet room, fragrant room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the chief of the
Riverside Tribe, a very famous and reputable person in the territory
controlled by the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He, I order
you to come out!” An enraged bellow suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” River Sansi
suddenly opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DONG! DONG! DONG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The subsequent three
massive sounds caused River Sansi’s face to change. He immediately
transformed into a ray of light, hurrying out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi, as a
Xiantian lifeform, had already reached the city gates, where those
enormous sounds had come from. Upon seeing the destroyed city gates
and the rubble, River Sansi’s eyes instantly turned red! The city
gates had been destroyed. This was like spitting directly into the
Riverside Tribe’s face, giving them no leeway at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are River
Sansi?” Ning stood atop the rubble. Seeing this black haired old
man suddenly appear, he immediately barked towards him. The entire
Riverside Tribe only had two Xiantian lifeforms, one male, one
female. The male, of course, was River Sansi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black haired old
man stared at Ning, his face an ugly sight. “No matter who you are,
you can’t trample the honor and dignity of our Ji clan like this.”
As soon as he spoke, within his hands, a purple set of chains
appeared. With a massive whirl, he sent those chain links flying
towards Ning in an attack. Just from the way Ning was acting, there
was no question at all that he was the person who had done this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly charged
forward, moving forward at an intense speed, generating a faint howl
like that of a great Roc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning landed a
kick directly on the chest of that black-haired old man, causing the
black haired old man to fly backwards. A deep crevice appeared in the
stone ground, with the old man sunken into it. The black haired old
man immediately jumped up, clutching his chest, a hint of blood on
his lips. His face covered in astonishment, he looked at Ning.
“You…who are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could this happen?
His magic treasure had yet to strike Ning, but Ning had sent him
flying with a kick. Fortunately, he was protected by his Xiantian Ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
sneered coldly. “Have River He come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another figure
appeared, this one red-colored. It was an old lady with white hair
dressed in red clothes. The old lady hurriedly helped prop up River
Sansi. “Sansi, are you alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful. He is
very powerful.” River Sansi said quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-clothed old
granny look at Ning, shouting, “I don’t know how our Riverside
Tribe has offended you. In addition, who are you? You destroyed our
gates. I trust you wouldn’t be so cowardly as to not even dare to
give us your name!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said coldly, “Ji
clan! Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
red-clothed granny was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
black haired elder, River Sansi, was greatly astonished. He hurriedly
said in a soft voice to the nearby granny, “Aunty Snow, the next
Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture has been
decided upon already. It is someone named Ji Ning. But he is only
eleven years old. How could he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prefecture Lord
of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture?” Aunty Snow was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
shocked at Ning becoming a Xiantian lifeform at the age of eleven,
they were even more shocked by Ning’s status; the next Prefecture
Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture! It was common for a
person to become a Xiantian before reaching the age of twenty. The Ji
clan alone had quite a few, such as Ji Lie who had also been hoping
that one of the three tribal youths he had brought up would reach the
Xiantian level before the age of sixteen. If Ji Ning had trained in
other Fiendgod Body Refining methods, he most likely would have
reached the Xiantian level as a toddler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the numerous tribes,
there were even more talented individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
who reached the Xiantian level before the age of twenty. River Sansi
was one such person! But these tribes didn’t have any powerful,
ultimate techniques. The more they trained, the lower their potential
became compared to the Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan of the West
Prefecture?” Aunty Snow stared at the youth in front of her. Their
Riverside Tribe was within the territory of the Ji clan of the West
Prefecture and was under their direct authority!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Ji clan of the
West Prefecture wanted to destroy the Riverside Tribe, it could be
accomplished as easily as lifting their hand up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master!” A
voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over a hundred black
armored guards appeared from afar. Upon seeing Ning standing atop the
rubble, the leader of the black armored guards, greatly shocked,
immediately fell down to one knee. The other black armored guards all
hurriedly called out respectfully, “Young master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rise.” Ning
glanced at them sideways. In these extremely large tribes, the Ji
clan would usually send a squadron of a hundred black armored guards
to stay there and watch over them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black armored
guards hurriedly ran over, standing around Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning.” The old granny, Aunty Snow, bowed slightly. “Since it is
River He who angered you, young master, my Riverside Tribe naturally
will not protect him. Sansi, go bring River He out as soon as
possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The black
haired elder, River Sansi, immediately went.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single Xiantian
individual wouldn’t be enough to cause the Riverside Tribe to lower
their heads! Even if the Xiantian belonged to the Ji clan, that
didn’t mean anything. After all, everything had to have a reason.
The Ji clan couldn’t act wildly either, otherwise how could the
many tribes submit peacefully? A single ordinary Xiantian lifeform
was not able to destroy a large-scale tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if it was the
Prefecture Lord himself! Then the situation would be different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep training!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He was an
extremely handsome young man with white skin. Only, his eyes
contained an extreme arrogance. Currently, he was holding a whip
while looking at a toddler, who was wielding a shortsword and
training in swordplay. “No matter how sore or painful your arm
feels, endure it. You will be the future clan leader of our Riverside
clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Father.” The
toddler gritted his teeth, continuing to train. He didn’t dare
stop. Stopping meant a whip would come his way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He, come out.”
A furious roar rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He’s face
changed. “Who dares to be this impudent and act like this in
Riverside City? This person cannot be ordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DONG! DONG! DONG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three kicks which
had smashed open the city walls were like kicks against his heart,
causing River He to unconsciously feel panic. “Who is it? Who has
come looking for me?” No longer paying any attention to anything
else, Riverside He hurriedly rushed towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He, what is it?”
The inside of the manor was in a state of chaos. His wife came out as
well, seemingly very panicked. Some of his other women were worried
as well, but some of them were secretly rejoicing at his impending
misfortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.” River He headed outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as he walked out
of his manor, from afar, a black figure suddenly pounced downwards,
arriving directly in front of River He. River He was shocked when he
saw the person. “Clan leader.” The black haired elder, River
Sansi, stared at him coldly. Sansi had an extremely ugly look on his
face, and there was blood at the corner of his mouth. His clothes
were extremely dirty. “This is all your doing.” As he said this,
he grabbed River He by the neck, as though he were picking up a
chicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He transformed
into a ray of light, moving at high speed towards the city gate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_11___For_The_Tribe"></A>
Chapter 11 - For The Tribe
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing on the cracked
streets, the white-haired old granny, Aunty Snow, spoke out. “Young
master Ji Ning, if River He has offended you, he deserves death.
However, given that he is still young, I wonder if he might perhaps
be spared?” In the struggles and battles between tribes, it was
generally possible for an important person who had been captured to
be released in exchange for a ransom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at her
coldly, not saying a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aunty Snow instantly
frowned. She understood that young master Ji Ning’s decision to
kill River He was unshakable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have the city
gates been destroyed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going on in
the Riverside Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, look, that
youngster is surrounded by a group of black armored guards. He must
be an important figure within the Ji clan.” Some of the outsiders
who had come to engage in trade in Riverside City quickly began to
congregate towards this direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the situation,
Aunty Snow immediately shouted, “Have all those onlookers f*ck
off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armored guards of
the Riverside Tribe immediately acknowledged, and quickly began to
shoo aside those outsiders as well as even some people of the clan,
not letting them draw close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of the way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of the way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One unit after another
of guards quickly ran at high speed towards the distant streets, all
of them wielding bows and other sorts of weapons. The leader of the
units were all core, high-level people of the Riverside Tribe.
Clearly, they had heard those explosive sounds from earlier and were
worried that an enemy had come in force, and so they had quickly
brought their own people to come over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granny Snow.” A
white-haired elder led a group to rush over. Upon seeing Aunty Snow,
he immediately called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aunty Snow only glanced
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One squadron after
another drew near. All of the core members of the Riverside Tribe had
arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” A black
shadow drew near at high speed as well, only slowing down once it
reached the armored guards. Those armored guards wanted to block the
black shadow, but when they saw it come to a halt, they were shocked.
“Clan leader!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi’s face
was like ice. Still holding onto that handsome young man, he passed
straight through the crowd. All of the core members of the tribe
stared at River He in confusion. River He was one of River Sansi’s
grandchildren, and was greatly valued by River Sansi. In the
Riverside Tribe, his position was in the top ten of the entire tribe.
Why had the clan leader dragged him here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” River
Sansi directly tossed him out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He fell
face-first into the rubble and rocks, wounds appearing on his face
and his body becoming covered with dust. He hurriedly raised his head
and stood up, looking around him. Soon, his gaze settled down upon
the fur-clad youth who was surrounded by black armored guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, I brought him for you.” River Sansi stood together with Aunty
Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are River He?”
Ning stared judgingly at River He. He couldn’t help but think of
poor Spring Grass, and his heart began to flood with a desire to
slaughter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He could feel
that this young master Ji Ning emanated an aura of power and
influence. In front of this young master Ji Ning…even the clan
leader and Granny Snow had to lower their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He pays his
respects to you, young master.” River He said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He…River
He…” Ning gently murmured, his eyes as sharp as daggers as he
stared at this youth in front of him. “Do you know why I have come
to find you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s voice was very
soft.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But when River He heard
his voice, his heart shook. He could sense the murderous intent
contained within Ji Ning’s voice!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
River He stared at Ning. “Young master Ji Ning, have you come to
kill me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire area was
utterly silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi and Aunty
Snow just watched. The core members of the Riverside Tribe just
watched as well. They could tell…that this young master Ji Ning
clearly had the power to change their entire world. Even the clan
leader had to submit to him. In addition, Ji Ning’s desire to kill
River He was clearly very strong. They just quietly sighed to
themselves…the glorious River He, whose prospects had been
limitless, was going to die today!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, if you wish to kill me, then I have no choice but to die.”
River He’s handsome face didn’t have a hint of fear on it. He
looked at Ning. “But I don’t know why you are going to kill me,
young master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why I am going to
kill you?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Darknorth sword
appeared out of nowhere into Ji Ning’s hands. Sword light flashed
across River He’s body. Instantly, a terrifying, suppressive aura
swept out, but River He didn’t dodge. The nearby River Sansi and
Aunty Snow just watched quietly as well. Even if Ji Ning had killed
River He with this sword attack, they wouldn’t say a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi! Chi! Chi! River
He’s body now had six bloody holes appear on it. His blood flowed
outwards from those holes, which were situation in his legs,
shoulders, and other non-lethal points.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This!” River He
stared, his eyes wide. “She…she was your…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now do you
understand?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword technique he
had displayed just now when stabbing six bloody holes into River He
was the sword technique of Spring Grass. When River He had originally
ordered his servants to capture Spring Grass, this was the technique
Spring Grass had relied upon when she had beaten those servants half
to death before leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mere woman. Young
master Ji Ning, you are going to kill me for a mere woman? Women are
nothing more than merchandise, just property.” River He howled in
disbelief, unwilling to accept this. “I’m willing to offer ten or
a hundred women to you, young master. In addition, she was just a
slave. I’m willing to do anything so long as you are willing to
spare me, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my eyes…you
can’t even compare to a single hair on her head.” Ning said
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His face ashen, River
He immediately retrieved a dagger from within his breastpocket. In a
gloomy voice, he said, “Young master Ji Ning, I, River He, have
offended you, young master, and I deserve to be killed. There’s no
need for you to dirty your hands, young master. River He will end it
personally.” As he spoke, he stabbed with his dagger towards his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword flash collided
against the dagger, sending it flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually think
you’ll be able to die so easily?” Ning stared at River He. “When
she died, she did so in agony and humiliation! How can I possibly let
you die so easily?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He gritted his
teeth as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shouted, “Mowu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Mowu immediately stepped forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The suspension
punishment.” Ning said coldly. “Hang up him at the top of
Riverside City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He’s face
turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The suspension
punishment generally meant one would have his hands and feet bound
up, then hung up in the air and given nothing to eat or drink while
allowing the sun to bake the criminal. In addition, prior to this,
Ning had left six bloody holes on River He’s body. Given River He’s
life force, he naturally wouldn’t die due to bloodloss, but the
blood he had lost would attract some birds. The birds which would
dare to draw near to the top of Riverside City were all ordinary
birds. They would occasionally take a peck out of River He’s flesh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would slowly be
tortured to death in the midst of starvation, agony, and terror…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, countless
tribesmen would all be watching. The humiliation he would feel in his
heart would cause a proud figure like River He even more agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Mowu quickly
retrieved a set of chains and began to bind and fetter River He.
River He knelt there, his head lowered, not daring to make a sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father!” A fierce
cry rang out, and a toddler came running out from the crowd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.” Seeing
that toddler running over, he hurriedly shouted in anger, “F*ck
off, f*ck off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” The
toddler sobbed. Although his father was strict in forcing him to
train with the sword, his father deeply loved him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant River Sansi
frowned. “Take the child away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, two guards
charged forward, grabbing the child and leaving with him. But that
child continued to wildly struggle while staring at Ji Ning, his eyes
filled with hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only stared back
calmly at the child. When he was very young, his father, Ji Yichuan,
had him train in courage by having him go kill some prisoners. He had
seen far more terrifying glares before. The slave markets of West
Prefecture City…he had seen numbness, despair, insanity, hatred,
supplication. He had seen every sort of gaze there was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hang him up at the
highest point of the city.” Mowu had two black armored guards help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River He was completely
tied up in metal chains, and his hair was a mess. The nearby
tribesmen watched, some of their eyes filled with pity. Others
delighted in his misfortune. This humiliation caused River He’s
entire body to shake constantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Mowu said softly towards Ji Ning. “That son of River He’s…when
cutting grass, you must tear out the roots!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced coldly at
Mowu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mowu hurriedly lowered
his head, not daring to say anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will spend the
next few days at Riverside City.” Ning looked at the nearby River
Sansi and Aunty Snow. “No need to trouble you. I will stay at the
place where the black armored guards are stationed. I will watch as
River He slowly dies. After he is dead, I will leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bodies of the
surrounding core members of the tribe all shook. All of them could
sense the hatred within Ning’s voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, River He
didn’t have too many problems, baking there in the sun. Afterwards,
when some crows began to feast on his flesh, and when the sun began
to cause his skin to dry and crack, revealing his red flesh, the pain
he went through was absolute hell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of the ki in
his body, River He’s life force was very strong, but this now
became a source of agony to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was baked in the sun
until his skin cracked and his flesh congealed. In the midst of this
agony, he moaned for three days and two nights before finally dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire time, Ning
remained at Riverside City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the black armored
guards reported that River He had died in agony, Ning finally took a
cold look at River He’s tattered corpse, then turned and led Mowu
and Autumn Leaf away, mounted on their black beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left Riverside
City at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riverside Sansi was
currently seated in front of a table, quietly drinking wine from a
beastskull cup.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a toddler
kneeling within the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cai, child.” Sansi
lifted his beastskull cup. “I’m going to ask you one more time.
Do you want to kill young master Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t dare. Cai
doesn’t dare.” The kneeling toddler said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi shook his
head. In a soft voice, he murmured, “The hatred you feel will be a
disaster to my Riverside Tribe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Servants!” River
Sansi called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A servant
entered and knelt down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi said
coldly, “Execute all of those servants of River He. None of them
are to be spared! River He’s women are to be sold off at the slave
markets!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” The
toddler grew frantic. One of them was his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And him.” River
Sansi looked coldly at the toddler. “River He’s only son…he is
to be sold off at the slave market as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” The toddler
hurriedly kowtowed. “Clan leader, spare me, spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The servant
replied respectfully, and then stepped forward, grabbing the toddler,
then departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The toddler continued
to struggle, sob, and cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slave?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why had this happened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching as the toddler
cried and called out in agony, River Sansi was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you are
going to sell River He’s women and children as slaves?” A human
figure appeared within the dark corners of the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">River Sansi nodded.
When River He had been undergoing the suspension punishment, Sansi
had sent people to secretly ask River He…and only then did he
understand that the source of this problem came from the Miwa of the
Blacktooth Tribe! River Sansi had even sent people to the Blacktooth
Tribe to speak with Blacktooth to clearly understand what this was
about. And then, he had put to death all of the servants who knew
anything about this affair at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning doesn’t
wish for Spring Grass’ affair to spread out.” River Sansi said
calmly. “Spring Grass had once said that she was the servant of
young master Ji. Everyone who heard these words needs to be put to
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no point
in keeping River He’s women either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River He’s sole
child, Cai…he has too much hatred towards Ji Ning. I asked him
several times. Although he verbally stated that he wouldn’t seek
revenge, how could a toddler like him deceive me? I could see
straight to his heart in a single glance. His hatred of Ji Ning is
bone deep.” Sansi shook his head. “At such a young age, he has
already learned to cover up his thoughts. In the future, once he
rises to a position of great power within the tribe, given the hatred
he feels for Ji Ning, I fear that he might act in a way that would
cause our entire Riverside Tribe to be destroyed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything that I am
doing is to ensure that the Ji clan knows that our Riverside Tribe is
loyal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man in the darkness
was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Breaker Three.”
River Sansi spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The man
in the darkness replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Send out Breaker
Nine.” River Sansi said. “Take Cai away in the darkness and send
him to the territory under the control of the Ironwood clan and have
him just join a small tribe at random. Make him give Cai good
training! If Cai has talent and always works hard, give him good
tutelage. If Cai quickly forgets his hatred and doesn’t train hard,
then kill him and have Breaker Nine return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The figure
in the darkness nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hatred…is a source
of strength as well.” River Sansi murmured softly. “Our Riverside
Tribe, compared to the Ji clan…we’re too weak, too weak…”

Chapter 12 - Serpentwing Lake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black beasts
were travelling through the desolate terrain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf couldn’t help but speak out. “That son of River He
has tremendous hatred towards you. If we let him grow up, in the
future, it will most likely be detrimental to you, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning cast a sideways
glance at Mowu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf hurriedly
said, “It wasn’t Mowu who said this to me. I knew that you
wouldn’t be happy, but after thinking about it for a long time, I
felt I had to say this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh.
“My enmity was with River He. I have no enmity with his son. I went
to get revenge. Why do I have to harm his child as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But when tribes
engage in battles against each other, we generally utterly destroy
any remaining threats…” Autumn Leaf wanted to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded. “For the sake of the tribe’s survival…any sort of
measures and means can be used! But how can a small child like him
possibly affect my Ji clan? My Ji clan controls this area, and has
put countless people to death. Who knows how many people secretly
hate our Ji clan? The reason that my Ji clan is able to remain in
command isn’t because we didn’t offend people, but rather because
we ourselves are powerful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf begun to
understand a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we don’t
offend others, if we aren’t powerful, others will still come and
destroy you.” Ji Ning said calmly. “But if we are powerful, then
those secret enemies might secretly feel resentment, but publicly
they will still be very respectful. Most likely, a century later,
their sons and grandsons will have truly become loyal subjects of our
Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, when
experts train, the heart and mind is very important.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mind and the
heavens become one! One with the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mind gains insights
into the Dao, and learns the true meaning of the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that a
person who was training in the Dao had to be true to himself. Only
with a clear mind and clear conscience could one improve at a faster
rate when training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If a person is not
true to himself, not only will he be frustrated, he will also come to
a halt in his training, or perhaps even lose ground.” Ning shook
his head. “If I, Ji Ning, want to kill someone, I will only kill
him and him alone. I will not harm his wife and children! This is my
true self!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life, his
illness had tormented him and caused him to always be alone. Lonely
people often would become accustomed to think about many things. Some
thought about too many things and would go insane, while others would
see through their own heart and mind and become wise. Ning was one of
those who had seen through his own heart, which made him all the more
broad-minded and calm. If he hadn’t seen through his own heart, how
could he have had such resolve to keep training so bitterly in this
life?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and Mowu
glanced at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Be true to themselves?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t
understand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” Ning saw
the looks on their faces and shook his head. “Don’t overthink it.
Let’s go to Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, aren’t
you going to the Blacktooth Tribe? Didn’t you say…that you wanted
to help take care of the little brother of Spring Grass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush.” Ning
shook his head. “I’ll make a trip to Serpentwing Lake first and
kill Serpentwing, then head to the Blacktooth Tribe…the original
cause of this disastrous affair was still Serpentwing. One of Spring
Grass’ two little brothers died to Serpentwing as well. I will use
Serpentwing’s death to commemorate Spring Grass, and then I’ll
take her only brother to the West Prefecture City with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rapped his black
beast on its chest slightly, and it instantly began to gallop
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and Mowu
followed him towards Serpentwing Lake as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They travelled by day
and rested at night. Given the rapid pace at which the black beasts
travelled through even mountainous terrain, they still spent three
full days before arriving at a place near Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten black armored
guards fell down to one knee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seated on the
black beast, nodded while instructing, “Mowu, Autumn Leaf, the two
of you can stay here and rest for a bit. Serpentwing Lake is a few
kilometers up ahead. I can’t take you there. I will go to
Serpentwing Lake by myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Mowu and
Autumn Leaf were both very respectful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning descended from the
black beast, and then, moving as agilely as a great bird, charged
into the distance. With but two flashing movements, he disappeared
from the field of vision of those ten black armored guards, Mowu, and
Autumn Leaf. This was the first time the black armored guards had
seen Ning displaying his footwork techniques, and they stared in
amazement and disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake was
currently forbidden territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan had
arranged for dozens of scattered little squads to be spread around
the area, each of which had ten black armored guards. They were
located in different areas around Serpentwing Lake, so as to keep a
close watch on Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua….” The
hundred-kilometer long Serpentwing Lake was vast. One couldn’t see
the other side of the lake. Such an enormous lake would of course
have three-foot high waves, even when it wasn’t windy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood by the
shore, staring at Serpentwing Lake. In a soft voice, he said, “This
lake truly is immeasurably deep. Even though I can control water, if
I were to enter its depths…my speed would probably still be far
inferior to Serpentwing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deeper one went,
the greater the water pressure would be, and the harder it would be
to control water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A human who was in
water wouldn’t even be able to bring out 10% of his power, but a
water monster would be more powerful than usual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, although
I am powerful, compared to a peak Xiantian Diremonster…most likely,
I’m just slightly more powerful.” Ning said to himself. And this
was because he trained in the [Windwing Evasion], and had gained a
hint of understanding into the true nature of the Dao. After all,
just by relying on the four stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens] alone, he would only roughly have power comparable
to other late-stage Fiendgod practitioners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Compared to
Serpentwing, his power would actually be slightly lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a series of
movements, Ning travelled a kilometer, walking atop the water as
though it were land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!” Ning
let out a loud bellow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!”
“Serpentwing!” “Serpentwing!” ….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound echoed like
thunder, spreading everywhere and piercing deep into the depths of
the water of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the depths of the
sea, within a twisting, dark lair, the Diremonster, Serpentwing, was
currently slumbering. His enormous scaled wings surrounded him,
protecting his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!” A
sound pierced through the water, directly arriving to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slumbering
Serpentwing suddenly opened his scarlet eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Serpentwing let out a low growl. “Investigate immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of screams
from terrified lesser water monsters could be heard from outside.
Although humans usually weren’t able to understand the languages of
these lesser monsters, these lesser monsters could all understand
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two black
armored guards hiding within the wild grass fairly close to
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is
challenging Serpentwing.” The two black armored guards exchanged
glances of amazement, then hurriedly turned to look. However, they
were dozens of kilometers away from Ning, and thus they couldn’t
see him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll keep watch.
You go make the report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were over ten
black armored guards on watch at all times around Serpentwing Lake,
and right now, the three black armored guards closest to Ji Ning were
all able to see him. This group of black armored guards had been
dispatched from West Prefecture City. Naturally, they were able to
recognize Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is young master
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji Ning
has come to challenge Serpentwing? But young master Ji Ning truly is
powerful. He is able to stand atop the water as though it was flat
ground. Just like Commander Ji Yichuan had been!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop talking. Hurry
and go back to make the report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The amazed black
armored guards quickly spread the news to all of the little squads,
but given their speed…as one might imagine, it would take them at
least a day before they were able to reach West Prefecture City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
calmly on the surface of the vast waters of Lake Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The head of a large
green snake appeared, along with the head of a large black fish.
Breaking through the surface of the water, they stared into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A human youth?”
The two monsters exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They both dove into the
deeper water, making haste to the watery lair of the Diremonster,
Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty King, mighty
King, there is a human youth in the water above.” The green serpent
monster and the black fish monster both growled out frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A human youth?”
Serpentwing’s scaly wings spread out, and his scarlet eyes stared
at those two lesser monsters, who were so terrified that they
trembled as they nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that human youth
is standing on the water, just like that Ji Yichuan had done so in
the past. The water doesn’t sink down at all.” The green serpent
monster said hurriedly, while the black fish monster also nodded.
“Right right right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Standing on the
water without it sinking at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing disappeared
into a black mist, then reformed into a black clothed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man
stood there, his slender, narrow eyes filled with suspicion. Serpents
were by their very nature cautious. Given that he had also been
pursued and often tricked into traps on multiple occasions by the
Xiantian experts of the Ji clan, he had long ago become an easily
startled creature. Now, a human youth who could walk on water had
suddenly come to challenge him. How could he not be suspicious?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you seen him
before?” The black clothed man looked at the two lesser monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Never, never. Before
this, we have clearly memorized the appearances of those Xiantian
lifeforms surrounding our Serpentwing Lake. This human youth
definitely isn’t one of those Xiantian lifeforms.” The green
snake monster hurriedly said, and the black fish monster nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man
nodded. “Then I will go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stealthily slipped
out of his watery lair. Although in his human form Serpentwing wasn’t
nearly as fast as when he was in his true form, his true form was
simply too enormous. If he appeared at the surface of the water, he
would cause an enormous commotion and would definitely be noticed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?” The
black clothed man quickly and stealthily lifted his head out of the
surface of the water to take a look around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately saw that
roughly eight or nine kilometers away, there was a fur-clad youth.
The youth looked very fine and delicate, but he casually walked atop
the surface of the water. The area around the youth was completely
barren and empty. There were no other human experts there at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man’s
narrow eyes instantly became filled with a terrifying, ferocious
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A murderous look!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hateful look!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These feelings
instantly filled his mind, causing the water around him to begin to
tremble with the force of his emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ji Ning
seemed to have sensed him, as he turned to look. Ning instantly saw
him. Although Serpentwing was currently in human form, Ning
immediately recognized that this was the Diremonster, Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!” Ning
let out an angry shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man
gave Ning a cold, sinister glance, and then sunk down slowly into the
depths of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing.” Ning
ran over at high speed over the surface of the water, quickly
arriving at that part of the lake. Staring downwards into the depths,
he shouted, “Didn’t you want to kill me? Don’t you have a
hatred for me which is so deep, it is engraved into your bones? Come
out, come out…I am waiting here for you to come kill me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The narrow eyes of the
black clothed man were burning with the flames of rage. He truly was
filled with an incomparable desire to fly upwards, attack, and devour
the flesh of this Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I personally killed
that big crimson snake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, I killed him
with a single blow. He really was pathetic!” The voice from above
continuously transmitted downwards, further stoking the flames of
Serpentwing’s rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man
was trembling slightly, but he managed to suppress the killing urge
in his mind. “I can’t be hasty. Can’t be hasty. If I am hasty,
I will fall into the Ji clan’s crafty trap. Before this, Poison
Dove Ridge and the Ji clan only agreed that I would be restricted
from leaving Serpentwing Lake for a century, and that only the
highest level members of the clan, the Zifu Disciples, would be
restricted from acting. There was no agreement forbidding those
Xiantian lifeforms from acting against me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humans and the monsters
fought viciously against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
some limits and some restrictions. For example, the true leaders of
each side wouldn’t act against and bully the weaker members of each
side. That old monster at the Zifu level wouldn’t kill…and the
Zifu Disciple of the Ji clan wouldn’t kill either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the Zifu
level experts were the foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Zifu experts began
to fight each other, once one fell, that would shake the very
foundations of a clan. Neither humans nor monsters wanted their
foundations to be shaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The area around that
Ji Ning is empty. There are no humans there.” The black clothed
man’s eyes flashed with a ferocious light. “But why would he come
to throw his life away? Most likely, his father, Ji Yichuan, and some
other Xiantian lifeforms are nearby, utilizing some sort of
concealing formation technique to hide there. Once I come out, I will
most likely instantly be attacked en masse.”

Chapter 13 - Serpentwing’s Lair
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood on the
surface of the water, staring at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was silent.
The only sound that could be heard was that of the wind blowing atop
the surface of the lake, and the waves it created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing is even
more careful and cautious than I had expected. Not only does he
remain within the depths, even when I, his most hated foe, appeared,
he still doesn’t dare come attack me.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To draw Serpentwing out
would be very hard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise, the Five
Prefectures of the Ji clan wouldn’t have been unable to do anything
about Serpentwing. Ji Ning’s breakthrough to the Xiantian lifeform
level was still a secret, with very few people aware of it.
Serpentwing naturally didn’t know either. In the eyes of
Serpentwing, Ning was perhaps just an eleven year old youth who had
very powerful footwork techniques. He wasn’t a threat, but despite
that, Serpentwing still managed to curb his impulse to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some heads were jutting
up secretly from far away in the pond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser monsters.”
Out of nowhere, that greatbow Ning had retrieved from Ironwood Zhan
suddenly appeared, along with four arrows. He quickly nocked his bow
and fired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four arrows
instantly pierced outwards, terrifying those lesser water monsters to
hurriedly dive down. But how fast were Ning’s arrows? Immediately,
a series of agonized howls could be heard, and even a large fish tail
flapped on the surface of the water. Leaving behind only a pool of
blood, the lesser monsters all hid themselves away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing.”
Holding his greatbow, Ning shouted, “I didn’t expect that you, a
mighty Diremonster, would be forced to the state of only daring to
have those lesser monsters appear. You really make me look down upon
you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep, growling voice
suddenly emerged from the depths of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt a
surge of joy in his heart. Serpentwing finally had spoken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
that you can succeed in using these despicable measures. Do you think
I don’t know that your father and the others are hiding nearby?”
The growling voice emanated from the depths. “How could you, a
little child of the Houtian level, possibly have come to throw your
life away?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Houtian?”
Ning laughed loudly. His body immediately began to be covered by a
layer of hazy light, while he pointed at the surface of the lake. A
sword light shot out from his fingernail, piercing straight into the
depths of the lake. “Open up your serpentine eyes and take a good
look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light
tunneled through the depths of the lake, creating tremors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huala…” Several
kilometers away, a black figure raised his head up, staring in his
direction with eyes filled with shock. “Xiantian? You are already
Xiantian?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare you battle
me?!” Ning shouted. “If you are worried that I have arranged an
ambush, then you can pick any location in the lake or any island
within this hundred-kilometer wide Serpentwing Lake! You and me, one
on one. Dare you battle me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing stared at
the distant youth atop the water. He hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Ji Yichuan and
his men were lying in ambush, how many places could they possibly
have prepared an ambush?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You humans are
incomparably crafty. Even if you, a youth, have reached the Xiantian
level, how could the Ji clan possibly let you just die? There must be
some scheme I don’t know about.” Serpentwing immediately sunk
deep into the water while roaring angrily, “If you have any
courage, come to the depths of the lake. I will definitely have a
battle with you here. Above the water? I definitely won’t fall for
your tricks!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, atop the water,
cursed angrily, “As cowardly as a mouse!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was so furious
that he immediately turned and left, walking atop the waves and
quickly arriving on the island in the center of Serpentwing Lake. He
leapt directly atop the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be so
cowardly.” Ning didn’t have any ideas either. He wasn’t so
arrogant as to head directly into the bottom of the lake to do battle
with a peak Xiantian aquatic Diremonster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the bottom of the
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty King, mighty
King, that human youth is on the island.” Several lesser monsters
reported.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He went to the
island?” The black clothed man sat there, suppressing the fury in
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Silvertip
and the others are on the island.” Suddenly, a serpent called out
in worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silvertip?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man
was instantly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He remembered now. Ever
since Poisondove Ridge and the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan had
engaged in their negotiations, he had carefully remained beneath the
water, not even daring to go to his lair on the island! But those
children of his and those lesser monsters weren’t as cautious. They
would occasionally head to the island. After all, in the past, that
island was their true home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many? How many
of my children are on the island?” The black clothed man shouted
angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should just be
Silvertip. But there are hundreds of lesser monsters there.” The
serpent immediately reported.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clothed man’s
face changed greatly when he heard this. “Immediately send some
lesser monsters to inform Silvertip and have him immediately come
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a human, after
all. When walking atop the water, he had to maintain his mind at the
‘one with the world’ level at all times. Since for now he had no
way of forcing Serpentwing out, Ning headed directly to the island to
take a rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This island used to
be Serpentwing’s lair in the past.” Ning glanced at the
surroundings. “In the past thousand years, this place has always
been the territory of monsters. Since I’m unable to have
Serpentwing come out, then I might have a good look at this island!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly walked
about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each step, however, was
like the wind, as graceful and as fast as gentle smoke. He wandered
about the muddy beaches of the island. The island had an area of
roughly twenty kilometers. It wasn’t a small one. There were some
hills and creeks in the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl….” From
afar, a millstone-sized crimson crab was currently waving its big
metal pincers, staring at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser water
monsters.” Ning kicked a rock, which with a ‘Swoosh!’ shot out.
Then, with a clang, it struck on the crab monster’s shell, causing
it to flip around multiple times before it came to a halt and stopped
moving. When Ning left, the giant crab flipped over yet again,
hurriedly charging back down into the depths of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This used to be
Serpentwing’s lair was in the past, after all. Even though
Serpentwing currently wasn’t here, there were still quite a few
lesser aquatic monsters who lived on this island. When they saw Ning,
these lesser monsters wanted to attack him. The weaker monsters were
taught a lesson by Ning, while when dealing with the peak Houtian
monsters, Ning showed no mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly turned and looked into the distance. From afar, there was a
great cavern entrance, from which a large silver serpent suddenly
emerged. By the side of this silver serpent were a number of lesser
water monsters that were many meters wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of those lesser
monsters were physically small.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, all of
them were peak Houtian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” Ning
moved, instantly charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That human youth
should be a Xiantian lifeform.” These peak Houtian lesser monsters
all growled to each other. None of them attacked Ning. Rather, they
all scattered in every direction, towards the distant waters of the
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That greatbow and four
arrows appeared in Ning’s hands, and he once more pulled his arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After firing those four
arrows, he fired four more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua! Hua! Hua! One
arrow after another shot out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the ten
physically largest Houtian lesser water monsters were all killed.
Some of the smaller, weaker monsters were able to escape into the
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you killed
yet another one of my sons. I will definitely kill you, definitely
kill you!” An enraged growl echoed from the depths of the lake,
causing Ning, who had been preparing to enter the lair entrance, to
be astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killed another son?
How many children does this old monster have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning curiously swept
the surrounding area with a glance. There were three Houtian-level
snake-type aquatic monsters that he had killed with his arrows. Which
one was Serpentwing’s child? Ning didn’t know that the old
monster, Serpentwing, originally had 92 children, only many had been
eaten by other monsters or killed by humans, with only sixteen
surviving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two more of those were
then killed by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, to
Serpentwing…the one he was the most devoted to was still Redtip,
the one which had Fiendgod heritage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old monster
Serpentwing, all you can do is shout out verbally. Does this lair of
yours have any more children within it? I’m going to go in and kill
them.” Ning called out as he entered the lair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This lair was a place
where Serpentwing had lived for a thousand years. It was dark inside,
with twisting paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved forward, his
Darknorth swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the lair, he
repeatedly encountered some aquatic monsters who charged at him. Some
were ferocious, others were bizarre. As soon as they saw this human
youth, it was as though they had seen a delicacy which they all
wanted to devour. For some of the extremely weak lesser monsters,
Ning would just knock them flying…whether they died as a result or
just fainted, he didn’t bother with them further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning still
exterminated all of the peak Houtian aquatic monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This lair truly is
infathomably deep.” Ning continued going deeper into the twisting
tunnels of the lair. Suddenly, within the dark tunnels, a blurry,
enormous beast shadow appeared in the shape of the head of a giant
grizzly. This enormous shadow of a grizzly head seemed to open its
mouth wide, trapping Ning within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed
dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, he
discovered that he was now completely incapable of movement. He could
neither advance, nor retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…is a
relic site!” Ning instantly thought of this term.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the boundless world,
from the Fiendgod era to the modern era, countless numbers of experts
had existed throughout the countless years. There were thus an
uncountable number of Fiendgod relic sites and Immortal mansion relic
sites throughout the land. Since humankind was spread across the
entire world, people would often accidentally enter some ancient
Fiendgod relic sites, some of whom would be able to gain some
benefits from these places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most, however, died
within these Immortal relic sites and Fiendgod relic sites. In just
the books which Ning had read, there were many famous ancient relic
sites that had devoured countless creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually
encountered a relic site. Live. I will definitely make it out alive.
Definitely!” Ning’s eyes were filled with incomparable desire. He
understood that in the face of these ancient relic sites of great
powers and Fiendgods, he, a mere Xiantian, had no chance to fight
back at all. His only choice was to submit to it, and then later try
to come up with a way to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous shadow of
a grizzly bear head swallowed Ning with one gulp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shadow vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning vanished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tunnels within
Serpentwing’s lair remained as calm and peaceful as ever, as though
nothing had happened.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_14___Underwater_Manor"></A>
Chapter 14 - Underwater Manor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning could sense
spacetime changing. It was similar to the feeling he had when he had
jumped into the Six Paths of Reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heartbeat later,
everything calmed down again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place…”
Ning hurriedly inspected his surroundings. He himself was in a large,
wide corridor that was three hundred meters tall and three hundred
meters wide. When Ning turned to look behind him, he was greatly
shocked. Behind him was the exit to this corridor, but the outside
was covered with a vast, endless amount of water. The water, however,
was completely unable to enter this corridor, as though some sort of
invisible screen was blocking out the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going on?”
Ning carefully stepped over, an arrow appearing in his hand. He sent
it piercing directly towards the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow collided with
an invisible barrier. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t pierce
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t believe
it.” Ning hurriedly took ten steps back, then took out that ‘Jia
Yong’ greatbow. Letting out a soft snort, his entire body began to
be covered with a crimson red light. Clearly, the Fiendgod energy was
being completely released. Pulling the bow into a near circle, he
immediately shot out an arrow, which flew like a ray of light towards
that invisible barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow was shattered
to pieces, falling to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning
frowned, carefully inspecting this corridor yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The corridor alone
is three hundred meters tall.” Ning looked through the invisible
barrier into the boundless water outside. “This building is
definitely astonishingly large, at least multiple kilometers across.
And it was built underwater…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it at the bottom
of Serpentwing Lake?” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake was
only a lake with an area of a hundred square kilometers. It would be
quite hard for such an enormous structure to fit within it. Most
likely, if it was in Serpentwing Lake, the Ji clan would have
discovered it long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just then, I had the
sense of spacetime twisting, as though creating a tunnel in space.”
Ning said to himself. “I’m afraid I’ve entered a separate
dimension.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having read many
books, he knew many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The books had recorded
that in the countless years of time’s passage, some powerful
Immortals or powerful Fiendgods were able to create their own little
dimensions. A single grain of sand might store an entire world of its
own! Some Immortal estate relic sites or Fiendgod relic sites were
located in these small dimensions and small worlds. Normally, it was
impossible to find them. Only by luck or misfortune would one
accidentally enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, these estates
left behind by these great powers were all extremely dangerous. After
all, how could the Immortals and Fiendgods not leave behind some
defensive mechanisms? The vast majority of those who entered relic
sites would die. If one was able to stay alive and flee, that would
already be a stroke of luck. As for those legends of people who were
able to actually obtain treasures from within, Ning didn’t even
dare think of that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t be greedy! I
just need to work hard to stay alive and escape.” Ning carefully
inspected his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The unknown represented
opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it also represented
enormous risks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This underwater
estate…for now, I’ll call it the Serpentwing Aquatic Manor.”
Ning casually picked a name for it. Since for now he wouldn’t be
able to leave this corridor, he might as well head in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corridor was wide
and tall, and the floor seemed to be made from a single massive slab.
Ning tried everything he could think of, yet still was unable to
leave a single mark on the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking a short
while.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corridor turned,
and Ning’s eyes narrowed. From afar, he saw one white skeleton
after another, littering the floor. The flesh on these skeletons had
rotted away long ago, but the strange thing was, there were very few
magic treasures on the ground. Only some of the most distant, most
complete skeletons on the far left still had some armor, weapons, and
magic treasures near them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other corpses
don’t have magic treasures?” Ning was suspicious. “Even if they
don’t have magic treasures, they should at least have some sharp
weapons. How could they not have a single one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a thought, Ning
sent his divine will outwards, picking up all of those skeletons with
armors and weapons and depositing them in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as they landed
on the ground, the skeletons instantly shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems they died
long ago.” Ning glanced at the armor and weapons. He immediately
picked them up and began to use his Xiantian ki to attempt to bind
them, but as he did so, he discovered…because the previous owners
had died too long ago, two of the magic treasures didn’t have any
magic power within them. Thus, Ning was easily able to bind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I can bind
them. It seems these are only unranked magic treasures.” Ning said
to himself. “It seems the dead only had Xiantian level power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning began to
inspect the various corpses. He quickly noticed a ring on one of the
corpse’s fingers. He immediately picked up the ring and began to
bind it. Indeed…this ring was the dead person’s storage-type
magic treasure. Taking a casual glance inside this storage magic
treasure, Ning was greatly shocked. The space inside it wasn’t that
great, somewhat smaller than Ironwood Zhan’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many magic
treasures.” Ning was astonished. Within this storage magic
treasure, one magic treasure was floating after another, all
possessing extraordinary auras. There were weapons, formation
treasures, armor, and even more storage treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why would a single
person need to carry this many magic treasures?” Ning glanced at
the many corpses in the distance, none of which had magic treasures
on them. “Most likely, this person had collected the magic
treasures of all the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly began to
bind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he started binding
them, he discovered…this storage ring had a total of 112
storage-type magic treasures, 136 weapon-type magic treasures, 31
armor-type magic treasures, and 16 bizarre magic treasures, including
formation-types. There were quite a few Dao-seals as well, but
unfortunately, too much time had passed, and the magic power within
the Dao-seals had all leaked out. Only ten or so Dao-seals were still
somewhat serviceably usable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I’m able to
bind them, then these are all unranked magic treasures.” Ning
murmured. “The previous owners of these magic treasures were all
Xiantian lifeforms. In other words, everyone who came to this tunnel
in the past were all Xiantian lifeforms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning selected one of
the storage-type magic treasures that had a storage space of nearly
three hundred meters, a storage belt, and wrapped it around his
waist. This storage belt, on the surface, looked like it was nothing
more than a sturdy, plain belt. Ning then selected an excellent
armor, binding it and then wearing it over his skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This armor was far more
powerful than the Goldstar Shirt. The Goldstar Shirt was thus
decommissioned, and Ning stored it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, these magic
treasures didn’t make Ning particularly overjoyed. After all, he
was the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
He would easily be able to obtain protective treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the number
is quite great. All together, the value is probably comparable to a
low-ranked magic treasure.” Ning didn’t think about it any
longer. The fellow in front of him had also acquired many magic
treasures, but in the end, he had also died. What mattered was
escaping with his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wielding his two
Darknorth swords, Ning carefully made his way forward. After all,
there was no other path he could take. His only choice was to
advance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of power, the
Darknorth swords weren’t inferior to these unranked magic
treasures. In addition, he didn’t have to use any Xiantian ki in
order to use them. Naturally, Ning would prefer to keep using his
Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forward
carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he walked past those
skeletons, he became even more cautious. Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">PA! PA! PA! PA! PA! PA!
PA!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One golden pea after
another suddenly appeared out of thin air. Many golden peas appeared
in the surrounding area, all of which let out a clear ringing sound
as they hit the floor. And then, these golden peas quickly began to
melt, transforming into a golden liquid, each drop of which then
quickly transformed into weapon-wielding, golden-armored celestial
warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flashing with golden
light, the incomparably dazzling, powerful celestial warriors and
celestial generals stood around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growing soldiers
from peas?” Ning was stunned. At the same time, he could sense that
these golden-armored celestial warriors all had powerful auras. He
could sense they were all at the Xiantian level of power. “And
there’s eighty one of them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You who dare
trespass in the manor, prepare to die!” The eighty one
golden-armored celestial warriors shouted in unison, and then they
charged over and attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Darknorth
swords in his hands, Ning instantly understood everything. Those
skeletons had most likely been killed by those eighty one golden
armored soldiers. Not hesitating at all, Ning instantly began to
utilize the Windwing Evasion technique. With a ‘Swoosh’ sound, he
ran across the side of the walls of the corridor like a giant Roc in
flight, instantly passing through those eighty one golden armored
soldiers and wanting to continue forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation,
activate!” The eighty one golden armored warriors shouted in
unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, at two sides
of the corridor, a hazy mist arose. As Ning charged into the mist, he
shot out with his sword, but was unable to pierce into it even
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
of escaping.” The eighty one golden armored warriors charged over
once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Trap Formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the two
hazy mists. “It seems if I don’t kill these eighty one golden
armored soldiers, I won’t be able to continue. Those fellows all
died, but I’m not as weak as them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning utilized the
Windwing Evasion technique, once again running across the surface of
the corridor at high speed until he arrived behind the golden armored
soldiers, and then he stabbed directly at one of those soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dang, dang, dang!”
Three sword blows at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pierced through
the head of that golden armored soldier, but the soldier still
stabbed backwards with his spear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.” Ning was so
frightened, he hurriedly jumped back in retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even a Xiantian
level Fiendgod Body Refiner stabbed through the head would definitely
die. How could this golden armored soldier not die?” Ning instantly
grew frantic. Just then, in that short exchange, he had discovered
that the spearcraft of that golden armored soldier could only be
considered at the ‘advanced’ level, but in terms of strength, it
was no lower than Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The worst part of it
was…not even stabbing through the soldier’s head had done
anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning’s
stabbing blow through that soldier’s head seemed to have truly
infuriated these golden armored soldiers, who all began to bellow
angrily and wildly attack him en masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning utilized his
footwork, moving through the attacking golden armored soldiers. At
every moment, he was dealing with three separate opponents. By
relying on his twin Darknorth swords, he stabbed through the throat,
skull, and various other fatal points of the golden armored guards,
but the golden armored guards remained undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
Ning was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around
Ning, three enormous lotus petals of fire and three enormous lotus
petals of water appeared, surrounding him in every direction. The two
layers of lotus petals were slowly swiveling in opposite directions.
Instantly, six of the golden armored soldiers who were within the
range of the Waterflame Lotus became crushed by the pressure of the
Waterflame Lotus back into liquid form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the golden liquid
quickly flowed outside the range of the Waterflame Lotus, then once
more reformed into six Golden Armored Soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible?” Ning, seeing the situation, couldn’t believe it. They
had already been dissolved; how could they reform?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t that the
previous Xiantian lifeforms were too weak; it was that these eighty
one golden armored soldiers are completely unkillable.” Ning
clearly found himself at a loss for how he should deal with these
eighty one golden armored soldiers. After all, even after they were
crushed, they simply liquefied then returned into human form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six golden armored
guards which had been crushed seemed to have caused these golden
armored guards to be even angrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare the
formation!” The eighty one golden armored soldiers shouted angrily
in unison. All of these golden armored guards flew out at high speed,
quickly completely surrounding Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These golden armored
guards formed into two circles, an inner circle and an outer one. The
inner circle had twenty seven golden armored guards, while the other
one had fifty four, all of them pointing their spears at Ning and
staring at him angrily.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 15 - The Full Story
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty seven golden
armored soldiers simultaneously stabbed out with their glittering
golden spears, carrying boundless force as they attacked Ji Ning! The
fifty four golden armored soldiers behind also simultaneously aimed
their spears, preparing to swap in at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s definitely
a flaw. There definitely is a chance for success. If they truly are
immortal, then they would exhaust me to death through by using up my
energy.” Wielding the Darknorth swords in his hands, Ning charged
forward, as fast as the wind. Dangdangdang! The Darknorth sword and
the spears clashed. Ning blocked the spears while at the same time,
charging into the midst of those golden armored soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty seven golden
armored soldiers in the center retreated in unison at high speed,
while the fifty four golden armored soldiers then formed an even
wider encirclement, allowing Ning to be the ‘turtle in their jar’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be?” Ning
suddenly frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
Ning made his decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around him eight pairs
of Waterflame Lotuses suddenly appeared, each one created from a
single water lotus petal and a single fire lotus petal. Because this
attack contained a hint of the true meaning of the Dao, even Ning had
to use his full force when utilizing this attack, and dividing his
mind to the point of creating these eight Waterflame Lotuses was
extremely arduous for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kakaka…” The
eight Waterflame Lotuses swiveled, grinding like millstones while
surrounding sixteen golden armored soldiers. These golden armored
soldiers all frantically dodged, but all of their bodies began to
crack from the tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden armored
warriors howled angrily, bellowing as they dodged past the Waterflame
Lotuses and attacked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, wielding his
Darknorth swords, was like a vicious tiger. His sword shadow danced
like fire, instantly chopping one of the golden armored warriors into
three pieces. But the body of the warrior who was chopped into three
pieces quickly then reconnected and reformed, then once more bellowed
and attacked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this really is
the case. This really is the case.” Ning was jubilant, and he
laughed loudly. “What nonsense about these golden armored warriors
having ‘immortal bodies’. That’s just for frightening people.
Every time I injure you, your power goes down. Haha. I want to see
how long you can hold on for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when the
eighty one golden armored guards had set up their formation attacks,
Ning, when blocking, had discovered that the power of these golden
armored guards had dropped slightly. Although it wasn’t by much,
Ning’s senses were extremely sensitive, so he was still able to
discover it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning
simultaneously created eight Waterflame Lotuses, badly injuring those
sixteen golden armored warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After exchanging blows
with them again, Ning discovered…that the power of these golden
armored warriors had weakened considerably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighty one
golden armored warriors are like a single unit. If one is badly
wounded, the others will be affected as well.” Ning said to
himself. “In addition, these golden armored warriors are made from
golden liquid. They don’t have any ‘vital points’ to speak of.
As long as I constantly injure them, their magical power will
constantly deplete…and in the end, they will definitely collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden armored
warriors were utterly fearless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
control the eight Waterflame Lotuses, causing them to surround and
grind down against the golden armored warriors repeatedly, while at
the same time he himself constantly dodged with his Darknorth
swords…Ning discovered that each time, when he stabbed the golden
armored warriors with his swords, their power dropped very slowly.
However, when the Waterflame Lotuses ground them to pieces, the power
would drop somewhat faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a war of
attrition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” One golden
armor warrior shattered and fell apart, transforming into
nothingness. Then all eighty one golden armored warriors completely
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a long
breath, releasing his nearby Waterflame Lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too…too
troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I didn’t have
the Waterflame Lotus technique, I probably would’ve been exhausted
to death.” Sensing the remaining ‘Crimsonbright’ divine power
in his body, Ning couldn’t help but sigh. The Crimsonbright divine
power in his body only had roughly half left. And this was only
because the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique he
trained in resulted in an extraordinarily dense base of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle had
primarily relied upon Ning using the Waterflame Lotus to grind them
into small pieces repeatedly, while he had only utilized the
Crimsonbright divine power in his Darknorth swords to defend! Despite
that, half of his divine power had been used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced behind
him, seeing those corpses lying on the ground. Some of them had been
transformed into dust from the battle, but a few still remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those that died here
were most likely exhausted to death.” Ning said to himself.
“Fiendgod Body Refiners are proficient at long-lasting, endurance
battles, but I still found it so hard. How could those who relied
solely upon Ki Refining to reach the Xiantian level possibly
survive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two walls of mist
at each side of the tunnel slowly dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully made his
way towards the corner of the corridor, not going forward yet. He
instead took a glance towards the other side, and saw that far away,
on the other side of the corridor, there were corpses present as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s even more
corpses. It seems the next corridor is just as dangerous. I really
wonder how many dangers this ancient relic site contains within it.”
Ning’s heart shivered. “And most likely, those who died there had
successfully passed through those eighty one golden armored
soldiers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at those
corpses on the other side of the hall. He realized that here as well,
only a few of the corpses had armor and weapons on them. He used his
divine will to pull one of the corpses and its magic treasures over
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who were able
to break through the previous corridor most likely had quite some
magic treasures.” Ning carefully inspected the skeleton. The large
skeleton was more than three meters tall. The most likely location of
its storage treasure was on the armguard covering its skeletal arm.
Ning quickly removed the armguard and bound it. “It really is a
storage-type magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This storage-type magic
treasure had more than a thousand magic treasures within it. Ning
easily bound all of them, but he discovered to his resignation…that
all of them were unranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them are
unranked.” Ning shook his head. “Although there’s more than a
thousand, all of them combined are worth perhaps less than 1% of the
Traceless Talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Traceless Talisman
was a guardian treasure of the Prefecture!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even ranked magic
treasures would find it difficult to compare to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a rest first.”
Ning sat in the lotus position. Taking out a bamboo tube, he opened
the cork, raised his head, and drank it. Then he took out some roast
meat and began to eat. “Although these old fellows who died left
behind their storage treasures, they didn’t leave behind any food
at all. It has been too long. Their food became dust long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These unranked magic
treasures aren’t very useful to me either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After all, I only
need a few magic treasures.” Ning shook his head. For example,
storage-type magic treasures; what was the point of having several
hundred? Would he gain any extra power at all? If he wasn’t able to
survive, most likely the thousand-plus unranked magic treasures he
had found would in turn be discovered in the future by someone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there, eating
and drinking, not in a rush to go forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, the
Crimsonbright divine power slowly began to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After eating and
drinking, Ning then flipped through each storage-type magic treasure
to see what was inside. Occasionally, he saw some training manuals or
sword technique manuals. However, the most important ultimate
technique books were generally destroyed after being learned, to
prevent them from being leaked to others! Thus, these books which had
been brought were all quite ordinary, not very valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a single copy was
comparable to the [Raindrop Sutra].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose this is an
unexpected benefit.” Ning laughed. And then he once more began to
flip through the large number of storage-type magic treasures,
searching through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clothes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utensils!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Toys!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of
curiosities were removed. During the treasure searching process,
Ning’s mood improved greatly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly picked up a strange piece of bark. He was about to toss it,
but then he saw the words atop it. His face immediately changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wudan, our clan just
received word that Immortal Juhua, someone who has lived for millions
of years, ever since the Fiendgod era, has publicly announced that he
is accepting disciples. Although Immortal Juhua is a Loose Immortal,
for him to be able to survive millions of years and undergo countless
tribulations without dying means, according to our clan leader, his
power is not inferior to that of a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua has
never before accepted a disciple. Not even the Second Prince of our
Grand Xia Dynasty was able to successfully become his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news that Immortal
Juhua is accepting a disciple has been spread long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Immortal
Juhua has also said publicly that the student he is accepting must be
a Fiendgod Body Refiner, who at least must be at the Xiantian level,
and at most can be of the Zifu level! He would set down two paths…one
for Xiantian lifeforms to traverse, while the other is for Zifu
Disciples to traverse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are three trials
in each path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After breaking through
the three trials without dying, one would become the heir to Immortal
Juhua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua will
only accept a single disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the place he is
accepting a disciple, Immortal Juhua has set his immortal estate down
in the Thousand Autumns Island of the Darknorth Sea. Most likely, he
will only leave after recruiting his disciple. Traveling from our
place to the distant Darknorth Ocean’s Thousand Autumns Island will
take at least half a year. Make haste. If you are late, someone else
will seize the opportunity. Wudan, I’ve given you the news. Whether
you go or not is your decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Signed, Godbanian
Water!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking at this
incomparably ancient tree bark in his hands, Ning couldn’t breath.
“Godbanian clan? This tree bark should be the bark of a Godbanian
tree. No wonder this ancient letter was able to persist for so long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godbanian tree was
immortal and would never decay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some precious items
would generally be put in wooden cases made out of Godbanian wood.
Godbanian trees were the unique products of the ‘Godbanian clan’,
and it was their proof of identity. That was a truly incomparably
powerful clan, unspeakably more powerful than the Ji clan. That was a
clan that could be described as supreme, even thoughout the entirety
of the vast domain of the Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua?”
Ning frowned, pondering. “Immortal Juhua was accepting a disciple.
He existed in the Fiendgod Era, and had been alive for millions of
years when he started looking for a disciple. But from the Fiendgod
Era until now, it has probably been billions or trillions of years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Far too much time
has passed since this ‘seeking a disciple’ affair. That Immortal
Juhua most likely died long ago.” Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loose Immortals would
constantly undergo the Three Calamities and the Nine Tribulations. It
was a miracle for a person to survive millions of years without
dying. How could one possibly have survived to this era?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then this
underground estate…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be the
underground estate where Immortal Juhua tested potential disciples.
This corridor that I am currently in should be one of the two
corridors for his potential disciples.” Ning said to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
distant corpses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although those corpses
were clearly of Fiendgod Body Refiners, the fact that they still
remained meant that they didn’t die too long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Xiantian-level
or Zifu Disciples who were Fiendgod Body Refiners often were
transported into this Immortal estate. He himself was one of those
unlucky souls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Immortal Juhua
decided to take an apprentice, the requirements for his apprentice
must have been extremely strict. Otherwise, he would have easily
accepted a disciple long ago.” Ning said to himself. “There are
three trials on each path. It seems that was the first trial just
now, which forced me to rely on the Waterflame Lotuses in order to
pass through it. The next two trials will most likely be even more
terrifying and dangerous…how will I past them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that I
will be like them? That I will die and rot here?” Ning looked at
the distant corpses, not breathing as he pondered.

City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, I heard Ji
Ning has already broken through to the Xiantian level.
Congratulations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, your son
really is formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s only eleven
this year, right? A Xiantian at eleven. He ranks amongst the top
three talents of the past thousand years for our Ji clan’s Five
Prefectures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan, who had
always been like an implacable glacier, had a rare hint of delight on
his face. Although he was still stiff-faced, those who were familiar
with him could sense how happy Yichuan currently was. Ever since Ning
had kicked down the walls of the Riverside Tribe with three kicks,
then knocked River Sansi flying with another kick, the news had
quickly spread back to the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This news had already
spread across all five of the prefectures of the Ji clan. As his
father, Ji Yichuan naturally felt very happy in his heart. The past
two days, he often heard words of praise and congratulations. By
nature, people liked to praise the praiseworthy even further. Now
that Ning had already been selected to be the next Prefecture Lord,
and also was so monstrous as to become a Xiantian lifeform at age
eleven, everyone understood that in the future, the lineage of Ji
Yichuan and Ji Ning would be incomparably glorious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This father-son duo’s
status in the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan would undoubtedly be
extremely high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at how happy
you are.” Yuchi Snow held a flask of water as she watered the
flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I not be
jubilant?” Yichuan sat on a nearby stone bench. Flipping his hand,
he retrieved a bamboo flask, contentedly drinking fruit wine. “Ning
was able to kill the Aquatic Rhino King before reaching the Xiantian
level. Now that he has broken through to the Xiantian level…he was
able to send that Riverside Sansi flying with one kick. River Sansi
reached the Xiantian level long ago, and is an expert Ki Refiner of
the middle Xiantian level, yet he couldn’t take a single blow from
my son. This means that Ning should have reached the Xiantian level
in the Fiendgod Body Refining methods as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the news
from the black armored guards stationed at the Riverside Tribe, Ning
had executed sword flashes to send River He’s shortsword flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning had
already reached the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Yichuan knew his
son very well, and knew the weaknesses in his son’s arteries. Most
likely only after the Fiendgod Body Refining technique raised him to
be a Xiantian level and remade his body would Ning be able to make a
breakthrough as a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens].” Yichuan looked at Snow. “This is
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. The legendary number
one Fiendgod Body Refining method! Our Ji clan has never had someone
break through to the Xiantian level through it, but Ning accomplished
it. In the future, he will definitely be even more powerful than me.
His name will be spread throughout the countless tribes, and our Ji
clan will become greater and greater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan was filled with
a heroic vigor right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan will
become greater?” Snow nodded gently. “Perhaps because of my son,
the Ji clan will reach the same heights of glory as my Yuchi clan
once had, but sadly, my Yuchi clan…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no clan
that will exist forever without perishing.” Yichuan said. “Even
the almighty Grand Xia Dynasty which has existed for countless years,
ever since being founded during the Fiendgod Era, exterminated other
ancient dynasties before unifying this land. Those ancient dynasties
had their own extremely long history as well. Weren’t they
destroyed in the end also?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow nodded. “I
understand. I’ve already made my peace with this. In Ning’s veins
also flows the blood of my Yuchi lineage. In the future, when Ning’s
name is known throughout the boundless earth, my ancestors of the
Yuchi clan will feel very happy as well, no doubt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the husband and
wife couple were chatting happily, the face of Ji Yichuan, who had
been drinking wine from the bamboo tube, suddenly changed. This was
the moment where Ning, at Serpentwing’s lair, had suddenly been
transported into that mysterious, ancient underwater estate relic
site.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Seated next to him, Yuchi Snow noticed that her man’s mood had
dramatically changed. “What happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” Yichuan
shook his head. “Only, I just remembered something I have to do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow frowned. “You
want to deceive me? Your face is completely incapable of fakery.
Given your mental willpower, normal matters aren’t able to cause
you to panic…and for you to panic to this degree, this must be a
major event. Speak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking at his wife,
Yichuan sighed, “I originally gave Ning a jade sword. No matter how
far away he is, I’ll be able to sense Ning’s location. I had
warned him quite strictly that he is not permitted to wander more
than ten thousand kilometers away from the West Prefecture City. If
he goes beyond it, I will capture him, bring him back, and put him in
the prison for three years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, he went more
than ten thousand kilometers away from West Prefecture City?” Snow
hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not it.”
Yichuan’s face was unpleasant. “I can’t sense the jade sword at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Snow,
shocked, suddenly rose to her feet, then began to cough, cough very
hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t want to
say it, but you forced me to.” Yichuan hurriedly helped support his
wife, rubbing her back. “Feel better?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow said frantically,
“How can you not be able to sense the jade sword? Didn’t you say
that you can sense it no matter how far away it is? If you can’t
sense it…does that mean Ning has encountered danger?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic.”
Yichuan said hurriedly. “There’s two possible answers for why I
can’t sense the jade sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first
possibility is that Ning has encountered some danger, and then took
out the jade sword, but before he was able to break it, the enemy
instantly disintegrated the jade sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second
possibility is that Ning was instantly transported to a very distant
location, so distant that even I can’t sense it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow calmed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow was very
experienced as well, and she nodded. “Even if your jade sword was
destroyed and broken into small pieces, you should still be able to
sense it. Unless it was completely disintegrated; only then would you
be unable to sense it. But right now, Ning is very strong. He was
able to send River Sansi flying with one kick. If he encountered such
great danger that he had to take out the jade sword…he would be
able to break it instantly. How could it be that he wouldn’t even
have the opportunity to break it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, if an
enemy wanted to kill Ning, but was capable of instantly destroying
the jade sword in Ning’s hands before Ning had a chance to break
it, then he would have the power to easily kill Ning. Why bother with
breaking the jade sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow’s train of
thought helped her calm down slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logically speaking, her
son shouldn’t have died yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it’s the other
possibility.” Yichuan said. “Ning was instantly transported to an
incomparably distant location. I can sense my jade sword no matter
where it is…although this is a slight exaggeration, within an area
of a million kilometers, at least, I should still be able to sense
it. To instantly be transported more than a million kilometers is
rather inconceivable as well. I think the more likely answer is that
Ning should have been transported to another dimension. He stumbled
into a relic site.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stumbled into a
relic site?” Snow nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them had
adventured in the outside world, and had significant experience. They
knew that this vast, boundless world was incomparably marvelous. The
relic sites that were left behind from the Fiendgod era alone were
uncountable in number. Some of those greater powers were capable of
opening their own small dimension or small world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where was the last
place you sensed Ning’s at?” Snow asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing Lake!”
Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to
Serpentwing…cough!” Snow started to cough again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said hurriedly,
“I’ll go. You can’t go out yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning is in danger.
How can I not go?” Yuchi shook her head. “You know this stems
from the illness that I had when I was pregnant with Ning. It’s
fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the look in his
wife’s eyes, Yichuan could only nod. “Fine. We’ll go find Aunty
Flower and borrow her Azure Firebird. We’ll head to Serpentwing
Lake at full speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast Serpentwing
Lake was very calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A godlike husband and
wife couple were currently standing atop the back of an enormous
Azure Firebird, flying at high speed in the air towards Serpentwing
Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and report
to the great King that Ji Yichuan has come again. He brought a woman
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Yichuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And sitting on that
Azure Firebird.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the lesser
aquatic monsters glanced into the sky, then, terrified, hurriedly
went to make their report.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the back of that
Azure Firebird, Yichuan and his wife exchanged glances. Soon, Yichuan
pointed at a nearby shoreline. “There are black armored guards
there. Azure Firebird, go there!” The Azure Firebird hurriedly flew
towards that direction, and the two black armored guards that had
been keeping watch on the shores of Serpentwing Lake stared in
astonishment at the male and female atop the back of the distant
Azure Firebird.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our respects to you,
Commander!” The two black armored guards hurriedly fell to one knee
in terror. They all recognized Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you, have you
seen my son, Ning?” Yichuan asked directly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We saw him.” One
of them, the taller black armored guard, immediately replied. “Just
now, young master Ji Ning was walking atop the surface of the lake,
calling out for Serpentwing to come and do battle with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow both
had the same thought. However, they didn’t believe that their son,
at his current level of power, wouldn’t even have the chance to
break the jade sword when fighting against the Diremonster,
Serpentwing. In fact, they even believed that Ning was fully capable
of staying alive in the face of Serpentwing’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this time, the
Diremonster, Serpentwing, wasn’t willing to come out.” The black
armored guard said. “Young master Ji Ning called him out to do
battle multiple times. His voice echoed across the entire lake, and
most likely the black armored guards in the other areas all heard it
as well. But because Serpentwing still refused to come out, nothing
happened. We were too far away, so as to where young master Ji Ning
went afterwards while walking on water, we don’t know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island was located
in the center of Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distance from the
shore to the island was tens of kilometers. At the distance of tens
of kilometers, the black armored guards were not able to see Ning at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? You are certain
they didn’t do battle?” Yichuan quickly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They didn’t. We
didn’t hear anything at all.” The two black armored guards were
absolutely certain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan went to the
other black armored guards to ask them these questions, and even
sought out Autumn Leaf and Mowu, who were waiting at the designated
meeting point. From these two, Yichuan understood that Ning had come
in anger, intending to execute Serpentwing, but Serpentwing had
remained in hiding and hadn’t come out…Ning had remained standing
atop the water, and then walked off and disappeared!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did he go?”
Standing by the lakeside, Yichuan and Snow stared towards the vast
lake, frowning in concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wife, what do you
think?” Yichuan looked at his wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow said pensively,
“There wasn’t any disturbance at all. It shouldn’t have been a
battle. It’s very possible that it really was an ancient relic
site! These relic sites might be in the middle of an empty area, only
sealed off from us by a thin barrier, but we can’t see them or
sense them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps our son is
within a world that is hidden within a single speck of sand at the
bottom of Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps he is
within an ancient, hidden formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only, the two of us
aren’t capable of dealing with any of these possibilities.” Snow
shook her head. “All we can do is wait. Wait for our son to come
back to us, alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Wait.”
Yichuan looked at the immeasurably vast lake as well. “I believe
our son will come from afar, walking across the water back to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow nodded gently,
leaning against her man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were still
waiting. Waiting for their son’s return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the corridor of
the aquatic estate, it was very dark. It felt that even the passage
of time was slow here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, his divine power
fully recovered, finally stood up. Staring at the other corner of the
corridor and its corpses, he understood that he had nowhere to
retreat to. If he wanted to leave, he had to go forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to live.”
Ning stared at those distant corpses, then walked over.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 17 - Dao War-Armor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wielding a Darknorth
sword in each hand, Ji Ning headed straight towards the center of
this ancient corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a thousand or
so meters in front of him, several blackish-blue seeds appeared at
the same time, four ahead of him, five behind him. These seeds
appeared at the same time as nine sets of battle armor. The battle
armors were all completely black, and the weapons were identical as
well; long staffs that were seemingly made of stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine seeds. Nine sets
of battle gear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…” The
blackish-blue seeds suddenly transformed into a liquid, flowing into
the armors, then transforming into massive men with blackish-blue
skin. These massive men were several meters tall and had two horns in
their foreheads. Their faces were ugly, and they had sharp fangs in
their mouths. They donned the armor, while simultaneously picking up
those three-meter long stone staffs next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine ugly giants
all glanced at each other, their eyes filled with savagery and
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been so long.
We’re finally out again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, the
person we have to deal with is this human youth. Such a
tender-fleshed human. I can squeeze him to death by myself. The nine
of us combined, and with these godly weapons and armor, haha…this
is going to be too easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Set up the formation
first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine ugly giants
all began to chant the words to some foreign tongue which Ning
couldn’t understand, but his face quickly changed, because he
understood that these ugly giants which had sprouted from those seeds
were intelligent, and even capable of conversation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two ends of the
halls once again became filled with dense fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human, prepare for
death.” The nine ugly giants all released furious roars. The
ancient armor on their bodies immediately began to emit dazzling
black light. The black light, emitting the stench of blood, quickly
connected with each other, forming an enormous spiderweb in mid-air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. “Dao
Battle-Armor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Soldiers were a
type of seed-soldier often used by the Grand Xia Dynasty. The Ji
clan’s most powerful seed-soldier, the ‘Scarlet Guardians’,
were the lowest-level type of Dao Soldiers. Every single Dao
Soldier’s armor contained a large number of rune inscriptions, and
the Dao Soldiers were capable of combining their energy together to
attack the opponent together. They were also capable of combining
their defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Battle-Armor like
that of the Scarlet Guardians of the Ji clan were at most capable of
allowing nine of the Scarlet Guardians to combine forces. Once they
joined together, nine Scarlet Guardians were even capable of giving
an early Xiantian expert a good fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What’s more, the Ji
clan had five hundred thousand of these powerful seed-soldiers, the
Scarlet Guards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the true
backbone of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, missions were
carried out by black armored guards. Each time the Scarlet Guardians
were sent out, it was only after the Ji clan’s Five Prefectures all
agreed to send them out, and it would have to involve a major event
of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Battle-Armor.
Aren’t they all used for Houtian experts? And they should be
covered with a large number of runes that can be seen at a glance.”
Ning stared at them. “But these nine strange giants have armor that
don’t have any runes on top of them, and each of them have power
that is not weaker than that of a Xiantian.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
trouble.” Ning held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Battle-Armor which
Xiantian experts could use was something which the six hegemons of
Swallow Mountain simply did not have. Ning hadn’t even heard of
such a thing. Most likely, only the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty
had them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The nine
ugly giants raised their large, thick staffs, charging towards Ning
from both directions with angry roars, that enormous illusory spider
web still connecting them from up above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
transformed into a ray of smoke, quickly pouncing towards the
direction which only had four of those strange ugly giants, who were
maintaining a distance of several meters from each other as they
wielded their massive stone staffs and charged forward wildly with
long steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” One of the
ugly giants raised his enormous stone staff up high, then smashed
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on.” Ning let
his strength explode as well. His Fiendgod-like power completely
filled his Darknorth swords, and he took this blow head on. He wanted
to get a clear understanding of the strength of these ugly fellows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone staff was as
thick as a man’s thigh and over three meters long. It slashed
through the air, smashing down on Ning’s Darknorth swords.
Immediately afterwards, with a ‘Swoosh!’ Ning’s entire body was
sent flying backwards, while the strange giant only took a single
step back, garbling in his racial tongue, “This human has great
strength. However, he still cannot compare to me, much less the nine
of us combined.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had only
fought one of them head on, because of the Dao Battle-Armor…in
reality, that staff blow had contained the combined strength of those
nine strange giants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flying backwards
through the air, Ning felt his entire body was numb. His hand was
damaged, and even the Darknorth sword in that hand flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t take it head
on!” In mid-air, Ning flipped over, his Fiendgod body quickly
healing. Still in mid-air, he stepped onto the sides of the corridor
walls, then like a giant Roc, scurried out, quickly leaping past the
oncoming charge of those nine strange ugly giants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of talent
is fleeing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans only know how
to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine strange giants
opened their fanged mouths, howling angrily. They discovered that
this human was even faster than them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed from a
distance. “Waterflame Lotuses!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Waterflame
Lotus was formed from a fire lotus petal and a water lotus petal. Six
sets of Waterflame Lotuses appeared out of nowhere, completely
surrounding those nine ugly giants within. Every single lotus petal
was slowly swiveling in opposite directions, forming a terrifying
grinding, killing force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
human.” The nine ugly giants came to a halt and looked at each
other. “Without this godly armor, we probably would’ve been
injured long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw that the nine
giants had come to a halt, and were even conversing in their strange
tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But his ever-successful
Waterflame Lotuses were completely unable to harm them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No use.” Ning was
surprised. Last time, when fighting against Ironwood Zhan, Zhan had
relied on his formation and his Diamond Seal to hold on for a long
time, which let Ning understand that his Waterflame Lotuses couldn’t
actually break through everything. “My Waterflame Lotuses were
developed just recently, and were originally meant to protect me.
Thus there are some deficiencies when using them to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wielding their stone
staffs, the nine strange giants once more charged forward en masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lotus Protection.”
In the area around Ning, three fire lotus petals and three water
lotus petals appeared, surrounding him. When the nine strange giants
charged over and collided with the swiveling Waterflame Lotus, they
were all impacted and were no longer able to attack Ning together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, wielding his
Darknorth swords, chose one of them to attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword flashed like
fire, moving at astonishing speed as he displayed the killing
technique of the [Thunderflame Sword], the ‘Thunderflash Flint’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua! Hua! Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rays of sword light
shot towards the giant, who howled with valiant fury as he brandished
his stone staff. The stone staff was incomparably heavy. Last time,
when Ning had struck it, his entire body had gone numb. No longer
daring to take it head on at all, Ning completely relied upon his
marvelous sword techniques to deal with the giant in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle armor was
only capable of protecting part of the body. The head and some other
areas were still exposed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword blows
were all aimed at this giant’s head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only, each blow was
hampered by that dense black light. After just barely breaking
through the obstruction, it was only capable of leaving some wounds
on the giant’s face, which immediately would heal, leaving the
giant unwounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill.”
Ning was going all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to live! So I
have to kill you all!” Ning used all his strength, even filling the
Darknorth swords with his Xiantian ki as well. All he could do,
however, was to leave some flesh wounds on these strange giants. The
giants were capable of completely ignoring the negligible drop to
their strength from these wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They fought for the
amount of time it would take to brew a pot of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he had been
controlling the Waterflame Lotus this entire time, and also fighting
all out, his divine power was being used up at a fast rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their power isn’t
dropping at all. I’m not even able to badly injure them.” Ning
could sense that he had less than half his divine power remaining. He
didn’t dare to keep fighting them head on like this. He hurriedly
flashed through their encirclement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning utilized the
Windwing Evasion, scurrying first in this direction, then in that
direction, dodging the pursuit and attacks of these strange giants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human, don’t run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans are only able
to run.” These nine ugly giants roared angrily as they ran forward
majestically, continuing their attacks. Ning didn’t take them head
on at all, relying on his Windwing Evasion to throw them off time and
time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Ning was
sighing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had trained in
swordplay for so long, but in the end, it was still the Windwing
Evasion technique which allowed him to stay alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another long period of
time passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
While fleeing, Ning was thinking frantically. Staring at the nine
furiously roaring giants, who didn’t seem to grow tired at all, he
thought, “They have been chasing me for half a day now, but they
still aren’t getting tired. My divine power, however, is down to
20%.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windwing Evasion
technique required him to use his Crimsonbright divine power as well!
Although it used it up at a rate that was far slower than the rate it
was used up in battle, running around for half a day would consume a
great amount as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My full-strength
sword attacks are only capable of giving them some light flesh
wounds.” Ning said to himself. “But the nine of them are actually
those nine transformed seeds, just like those eighty one golden
armored soldiers I fought earlier. When I shattered their army, they
immediately reformed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood very
well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he were to
pierce through their heads, they still probably wouldn’t die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More importantly, his
full strength attacks were only capable of leaving behind some flesh
wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly should
I do?” Ning constantly pondered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the long-ago
distant past, those Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level who
were transported probably watched, just like me, in despair as their
divine power was used up, and then were killed.” Ning now
understood his weakness. His weakness was that his [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was only at the fourth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This corridor was meant
for Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level to go through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Immortal Juhua had
accepted disciples, most likely the majority of those who had
attempted these trials were at the peak Xiantian level as Fiendgod
Body Refiners! But Ji Ning? Only when reaching the sixth stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] would he be a peak
Xiantian. He was currently only at the fourth stage! In terms of the
purity or the depth of his divine power, he was still at an
incomparable distance from the limits of the Xiantian level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was only natural
that he wouldn’t be able to complete these three trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to those
Xiantian experts who wanted to become the disciple of Immortal Juhua
and came here to attempt these trials, my divine power is very
shallow.” Ning understood. “Fortunately, I gained a hint of
understanding in the true meaning of the Dao, and then developed the
‘Waterflame Lotus’ technique, which is why I was lucky enough to
complete the first trial! Otherwise, I probably wouldn’t even have
been able to complete the first one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…there are
three trials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about the
third trial. This second trial…” Ning could sense that he already
had dropped to less than 10% of his Crimsonbright divine power left.
Deep in his heart, he felt both panic and despair.

Chapter 18 - Determining Life and Death
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t keep
running. If I keep running, the Crimsonbright divine power in my body
will be completely used up. Once my divine power is used up, I will
definitely die. I won’t even be able to struggle.” Ji Ning
suddenly came to a halt, then turned to look towards the four ugly
giants, already extremely angry due to the long chase. The ugly
giants wielded those stone staffs, charging forward with large steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He finally stopped
running.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The human should be
out of divine power by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Competing with us in
running. We could run for several more days without fear.” The nine
ugly giants wanted to devour this human in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a sword in
each hand, standing there calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with life and
death, Ning’s spirit was incomparably calm and empty. In this
moment, he had thrown all other thoughts to the back of his mind, and
in his heart, the only thing remaining was this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The nine
ugly giants charged forward, and Ning immediately charged forward as
well. Three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals slowly
swiveled around him, causing the giants to be unable to attack Ning
simultaneously when they drew near him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword struck
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword like fire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanton slaughter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, his sword is
too weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too weak.” The
ugly giants didn’t care at all. Ning’s sword pierced through the
protection of that thick black light, but was only able to leave
behind a hint of a wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was very
calm, he was using his full force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not much divine
force left.” Ning could feel that his divine power was ebbing.
Grinding his teeth, he suddenly charged forward like a giant Roc
soaring into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corridor was a
hundred meters high, so Ning leapt a hundred meters into the air.
While flying, two ancient Dao-seals appeared in Ning’s hands. One
was a Light Body Seal, while the other was a Divine Movement Seal.
The Xiantian ki in his body immediately rushed into the two
Dao-seals, and two queer surges of power immediately flowed into
Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last sword!”
Ning hit the very top of the corridor, and then with two kicks,
released all of his power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He charged downwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Relying on the force
from springboarding off the ceiling, the always-terrifying speed of
the [Windwing Evasion], and the force of gravity pulling him
downwards, as well as the Light Body Seal and the Divine Movement
Seal, his speed became all the more terrifying! In this moment,
Ning’s downward charging speed had reached a heretofore unreached
level, as fast as light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Speed is power. When
speed reaches a certain extreme, the power of the sword would
naturally be great as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The raindrop holds
the meaning of Raindrop Pierces Rocks. The raindrop can become a Rain
Line, a Thin Stream, a river or an ocean.” As Ning charged
downwards, he was using the killing stroke of the Raindrop Sutra, the
‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’. As he did so, in his mind, he couldn’t
help but think back to the scene of his father, Ji Yichuan, teaching
him swordplay. His father had once demonstrated all nine stances of
the Raindrop Sword for him, three times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, when
faced with death, Ning immediately understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his father
demonstrated the swordplay, he moved very slowly. He started from
‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’, then moved to ‘Rain Line’,
‘Eternally Fresh Waterflow’, ‘Merciless Waterflow’, and then
finally returned to the ‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right after that, it
transformed into ‘Drizzling Rain’, ‘Tempest Curtain’, ‘Water
Curtain Links to Heaven’, and finally returned once more to the
‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, it
transformed once more into ‘Thin Streams Flow Forever’,
‘Watertight’, before finally returning to ‘Raindrop Pierces
Rocks’ once more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks is the most powerful attack, but also the weakest attack. The
amazing mysteries in the [Raindrop Sutra] are inexhaustible and
boundless. One can spend a lifetime training in it. Remember…Raindrop
Pierces Rocks!” Yichuan had said these words. At the time, Ning had
felt he understood them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But after that night of
meditating on the Dao, and these repeated life-and-death battles,
Ning at this moment finally, truly understood what his father had
labored to teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, charging
downwards at high speed with twin swords, immediately drew away one
of the stone staffs of an ugly giant, sending it smashing to one
side. With his right hand, Ning pierced directly towards the ugly
giant’s skull! The ugly giant’s stone staff had missed its
downwards smashing mark; naturally, he didn’t have the chance to
raise it back to block, but he wasn’t afraid at all. “He can’t
hurt me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Pierces Rocks!”
Ning only stared calmly at the head of that giant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword was like
water, like a heavy raindrop landing upon a stone. Pa! The sword
instantly pierced through that thick black barrier, driving itself
deep into the head of that giant, even into the brain. The
terrifyingly natural power of the blow suddenly exploded. There was
nothing in the body that could block it, and so, instantly, with a
‘Swish!’ sound, the head exploded. It transformed into a puddle
of black water, and the armor and the stone staff all fell to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Collect.” Ning
immediately collected both the armor as well as the stone staff into
his own storage magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pool of black water
quickly reformed into the strange giant again, who called out in
shock, “How is that possible? How is that possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing is
impossible.” Ning was now completely confident. He understood that
these nine strange giants were no longer able to stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only had to
control his Waterflame Lotus to quickly once more smash the strange
giant into a puddle of black water. Without the protection of the Dao
Battle-Armor, the giant wasn’t able to resist the crushing force of
the Waterflame Lotus at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you can
die as well now.” Ning transformed into a blur, once more flashing
forth like lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All nine Dao
Battle-Armors had to be linked together for them to be able to assist
each other. Right now, the strange giants weren’t able to combine
their strength at all. Now, when facing Ning’s vastly improved
swordplay…they became unable to flee. All of them were killed, one
after the other, and even their Dao Battle-Armor and stone staves
were stored by Ning into his storage treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
unmoving, only relying on the Solar and Lunar Divine Tattoos to
control six Waterflame Lotuses, repeatedly grinding down on those
nine giants, smashing them time and time again into black water. Even
though they reformed, Ning would simply grind them apart again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being crushed
just a few times, the nine strange giants completely collapsed and
weren’t able to reform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fog at the two ends
of the corridor slowly faded away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
gently murmured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although that night he
had spent meditating on the Dao resulted in Ning gaining a hint of
true understanding regarding fire, water, and wind, understanding was
nothing more than understanding; whether or not it could be used was
another matter. In the past, Ning only understood the Waterflame
Lotus, this single technique, which was meant for self-protection,
not for attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just now, relying
on the guidance his father had given him to be his foundation, in
that moment between life and death, he had finally understood the
true meaning of the [Raindrop Sutra] - the True Meaning of the
Raindrop!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of levels of
understanding…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The level above ‘one
with the world’ was that of the ‘True Meaning’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The True Meaning of
the Raindrop originates from the ‘raindrop’.” Ning sighed in
amazement. “A single raindrop is the source. When there are many
raindrops, it can transform into a line and become the ‘Rain Line’.
When there are even more raindrops, naturally it can begin to flow
and have life force, which is the ‘Eternally Fresh Waterflow’.
And once the waves swell to an unblockable tide, that becomes
‘Merciless Waterflow’. But when the countless raindrops all come
together, you can still describe it as just a single raindrop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks is the most powerful attack of the Raindrop Sutra, but also its
weakest.” Ning laughed. “That is true for defense as well.
Drizzling Rain, Tempest Curtain, Water Curtain Links to Heaven…they
all become Raindrop Pierces Rocks in the end. Thin Streams Flow
Forever and Watertight also become Raindrop Pierces Rocks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The True Meaning of
the Raindrop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An unending circle.”
Ning sighed in amazement. “No wonder Father said that one can spend
a lifetime on the Raindrop Sutra.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without question, his
father had clearly understood the True Meaning of the Raindrop long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One truly could spend a
lifetime to understand that the [Raindrop Sutra] could infinitely
circle in on itself to grow even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon gaining insight
into the True Meaning of the Raindrop, the [Raindrop Sutra] itself
actually became without value. Perhaps the ancestor who had
originally developed the [Raindrop Sutra] himself only reached this
level, the True Meaning of the Raindrop, after having in some lucky
circumstance developed these nine techniques that could forever cycle
without ending. But of course, it was also possible that it was some
sort of powerful Fiendgod or powerful Immortal who intentionally
developed this sort of inexhaustible, circular, increasingly powerful
swordplay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks. Raindrop Pierces Rocks.” Ning chanted softly, and then he
shut his eyes to rest. That battle had been too exhausting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After resting and
eating to his fill, Ning’s divine power recovered and then he began
to perfect his True Meaning of the Raindrop. Upon having learned the
True Meaning of the Raindrop…he was completely capable of using one
small raindrop after another to create a thin line, then execute the
‘Rain Line’. The power of this attack was far greater than that
of Raindrop Pierces Rocks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ate and drank.
Fortunately, prior to this, his kalestone and Ironwood Zhan’s
storage treasure all had some food within it. What he lacked right
now was time. As time went out, if he was able to increase his
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] by another stage, if he
could make his swordplay become even more powerful, then his chances
of survival would naturally become greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had relied on the
Waterflame Lotus to make it through the first trial, while in the
second trial, he had been pushed to his limits, at which point he had
gained insights into the True Meaning of the Raindrop, finally making
that breakthrough in peril. Based on the increase in difficulty, the
third trial would definitely be very terrifying. Since Immortal Juhua
had publicly called for a disciple, one could imagine how difficult
this third trial must have been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan and Yuchi
Snow, husband and wife, were temporarily staying here by the side of
Serpentwing Lake. They were quietly waiting. Waiting for their son to
return. But as one day after another passed, their hearts grew
increasingly frantic, because the more time passed, the lower the
chances were that their son was still alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cough, cough.”
Snow was coughing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic, don’t
panic.” Yichuan saw that in one short month, his wife’s illness
had rapidly worsened, making him feel all the more pity for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to
panic either.” Snow stared at the endless waters of Serpentwing
Lake, then sighed. “But Ning, Ning, he…it’s been more than a
month. Why hasn’t he come back yet. Why hasn’t he come back yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Yuchi Snow, her son
was her whole world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our son will
definitely come back. Definitely. When you were pregnant with Ning,
the roots of your illness took hold. You can’t be angry, and you
can’t panic. You know that. Take care of your body.” Yichuan’s
heart was as frantic as a scorching fire. In his heart, he cared
deeply about his son, but he was also worried about his wife by his
side. Ever since that great battle they had fought on the way back
from the Darknorth Seas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Whitewater
Hound had braved a serious injury to take his wife away and flee, and
their son had been lucky enough to survive, his wife and his son had
both been injured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yichuan
stared at the boundless lake waters as well. “You have to come back
alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the endless
hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no day or
night within this hallway, and there was no way to clearly judge the
passing of time. His appetite was enormous, but the amount of food in
the kalestone wasn’t that much, nor the amount in Ironwood Zhan’s
storage treasure. After all, they could hunt for food at any time in
Swallow Mountain, while the kalestone had size limitations, so why
put in too much?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a month, all of
the stored food was completely devoured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thin Streams Flow
Forever and Rain Line have all reached the ‘True Meaning of the
Raindrop’ level.” Ning said to himself. One was a defensive
technique, while the other was offensive. His power could be
considered to have greatly advanced. “After a month of training, my
divine power has grown stronger as well. This third trial is the
final battle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood how
terrifying this final trial would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He also understood that
if he passed through it, then he would survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he failed, he
would die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whether it is life
or it is death, it all comes down to this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I die, I will
most likely go to the Netherworld Kingdom again. This time, I
probably won’t be so lucky as to avoid drinking Granny Meng’s
Elixir. After drinking it, I will no longer be myself.” Ning had a
dim sense right now, the deep, unconscious sense which one would have
when one’s soul grew powerful. His unconscious sense felt a type of
incomparable terror right now, as though he was about to face an
incomparably terrifying trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to determine
life or death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wielding the Darknorth
swords in his hands, Ning headed directly for a twisting corridor,
which still had three corpses on it that hadn’t completely rotted
away, as well as some magic treasures scattered on the floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his divine
sense to pick them up, calmly binding them. Upon investigating, he
found that there were thousands of magic treasures stored within a
storage treasure, all of which he could easily fuse. Indeed, these
were all unranked magic treasures. However…such a terrifying number
still represented an incomparably astonishing wealth. Ning was very
calm though. Because…if he died, what use would these be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You finally came.”
A hoarse voice rang out, in the tongue of the humans which was spoken
everywhere throughout the Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately looked
over. From afar, in a place filled with black mist, a figure walked
out. He had a crooked body, an oily green gaze, and his entire body
was covered with black fur. He seemed to walk very slowly, but with
each step, he travelled dozens of meters. “A pity. You are too
weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, he
appeared in front of Ning. His fan-sized, big grey palm carried a
dense, deathly aura which slammed down towards Ning. This simple slap
was so fast that Ning was completely unable to dodge. All he could do
was relying on using his two swords to execute his ultimate defensive
technique, ‘Thin Streams Flow Forever’, to block it. This ‘Thin
Streams Flow Forever’ technique was currently also holding the True
Meaning of the Raindrop within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” Ning was
knocked flying, and his hands instantly turned numb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Ning wanted
to tighten his grip over the Darknorth swords in his hands. If his
swords were sent flying, how would he use his sword techniques? But
his fingers were already completely numbed and had no feeling. Hua!
Hua! His shattered fingers and his two Darknorth swords flew far
away, smashing into the distant walls and emitting a clear ringing
sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every part of Ning’s
skin had split open, and he was surrounded by a bloody mist. The
fingers on both hands had been shattered. And so, his entire body
covered by that bloody mist, he flew backwards and smashed against
the distant ground.
