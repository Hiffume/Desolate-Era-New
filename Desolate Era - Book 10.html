Chapter 1 - Youngflame Clan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just shortly after
Ninelotus reached Serpentwing Lake, in the distant Crimson Dragon
Mountains of Stillwater Commandery, a large group of people were
gathered around the tall, large teleportation array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had
powerful auras. Clearly, none of them were ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox was
standing behind a tall, skinny man. He sent to him, “Father , who
did you pull me over here to meet? You didn’t even permit me to ask
about this while we were in Stillwater City; you insisted on bringing
me to the Raindragon Guard branch before telling me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, skinny man
was dressed in a black uniform. He wore a crown on his forehead, and
his eyes were sunken and deep. However, his pupils seemed to carry a
cold light that would bring fear to many.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This man was Northmont
Fox’s father…Northmont Yin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two most likely
candidates to become the next Marquis of Stillwater were Northmont
Blacktiger and Northmont Yin. They had completely different
temperaments. Northmont Blacktiger was like an enormous, primordial
beast who was born with a dominating aura; anyone who looked at him
would feel terror. In acting, he was incomparably dominating as well,
and so he had many followers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Northmont Yin,
he was a truly ambitious and ruthless figure who was particularly
skilled at biding his time. Nobody could see through Yin’s
thoughts; he was a mystery to all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I told you in
Stillwater City, given your temperament, you might have leaked this
information, which would be disastrous.” Yin shook his head. “This
matter is extremely important, and very few know of it. Look at
Immortal Eastrock of the local Raindragon Guard branch; he’s
waiting, just like us. Although he’s brought a group of
subordinates, I imagine that only he himself knows exactly who it is
that we are waiting for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox instantly felt an
itchy feeling in his heart. Someone capable of making even Immortal
Eastrock and Yin come in person to wait for him, and to act so
secretively as for Yin to not even tell Fox, his own son, who it was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?” Fox
was extremely anxious to know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person is
Youngflame Nong, of the Youngflame lineage,” Yin sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox’s face instantly
changed. He revealed a look of shock and amazement as he yelped back
mentally, “Young master Youngflame Nong? One of the Four Dukelings
of the imperial capital? Why has he come to Stillwater Commandery?
This, this…how can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now do you
understand why I didn’t tell you?” Northmont Yin cast his son a
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox hurriedly
nodded. He understood. Of course he understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Northmont
clan of Stillwater held a marquisdom and was incomparably ancient and
large, if they were compared to the rest of the Grand Xia
Dynasty…there were still powers that were even mightier than the
Northmont clan. For example, the almighty imperial clan of the Grand
Xia Dynasty, the Xiamang clan, or some of the most powerful clans
that had helped the Xiamang clan unify the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan was
one of the faithful ministers that served the imperial clan of the
Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supposedly, during the
Fiendgod era, the Youngflame clan was a clan that was as old and as
powerful as the Xiamang clan. In fact, their history stretched to the
most ancient of eras of this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the
Youngflame clan had submitted to the Xiamang lineage! They had
followed the Xiamang clan in conquering the world, and had been one
of the most powerful clans under the Xiamang clan’s control. As for
the the Northmont clan and the other clans, they had all slowly begun
to join the Xiamang clan later on, and in terms of power, they were
vastly inferior to the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And nowadays…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan’s
leader had the revered title of the ‘Godplume Duke’, and the clan
itself held three marquisdoms! The three commanderies it ruled over
were all extremely vast ones, far larger than Stillwater Commandery.
After all, the 3600 commanderies of the Grand Xia Dynasty were all
different in size; Stillwater Commandery could only be described as
an ordinary one. Some extremely large commanderies were comparable in
size to dozens of Stillwater Commanderies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this Youngflame
Nong who was about to arrive, he was one of the leaders of the
younger generation of Youngflame nobles. Unless something went amiss,
the next clan leader of the Youngflame clan, the ‘Godplume Duke’,
would be this Youngflame Nong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
Youngflame clan’s next leader had not been 100% set in stone; the
selectees would still be tested and tried. Generally, however, the
trials would be easily passed. It could be said that Youngflame
Nong’s status in the Youngflame clan was comparable to Ji Ning’s
status, when he had been a child, in the West Prefecture City of the
Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Internally, it had all
but been decided that he would be the next Godplume Duke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would be a powerful
figure, capable of influencing the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. The
arrival of someone like him…it now made perfect sense as to why
Northmont Yin and Immortal Eastrock had come in person and been so
secretive about it, not letting anyone else know what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their eyes all lit up.
The teleportation array once more began to glow, and then a group of
people appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader was dressed
in azure robes. He seemed quite plainly dressed, but upon a close
examination…one would discover that the threads of this azure robe
were actually the draconic whiskers of the ‘divine dragons of the
East Sea’. The man’s face had a calm smile on it, but the
welcomers could all sense the natural, noble aura emanating from him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a true, noble
aura which only someone like him, who an ancient clan like the
Youngflame clan had trained to be their next leader, would possess!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
status was such that even in the imperial capital of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, he was called one of the ‘Four Dukelings’. Even imperial
scions of the Xiamang clan had to have enough status within their
clan to be able to treat with them on an equal footing. There were
some members of the clan who borrowed the Xiamang clan’s prestige
but had no real status within it; these people weren’t even
qualified to become friends with Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame,” Northmont Yin laughed and saluted with clasped hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.” Immortal Eastrock also clasped his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong looked
at the two of them, then nodded. “Northmont Yin, Eastrock. I saw
the two of you last time at the imperial capital. So much time has
passed, as though in the blink of an eye. I have to trouble the two
of you on this trip of mine to Stillwater City; I truly am guilty for
doing so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is our honor to
be able to assist you, young master Youngflame,” Immortal Eastrock
and Northmont Yin both spoke out together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
couldn’t help but glance at the person slightly behind Youngflame
Nong. There was a tall, skinny, narrow-eyed, middle-aged man standing
there, his skin pitch-black. The aura this man was emanating caused
even Northmont Yin and Immortal Eastrock to feel secretly astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them quickly
came to this realization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for an ancient
clan like the Youngflame clan, raising Fiendgods wasn’t too
difficult. After all, these ancient clans had been flourishing since
shortly after the major world was created. They had long ago captured
countless Fiendgods. Although Fiendgods were arrogant, in the face of
certain death, many would still be willing to submit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.” Immortal Eastrock pointed at the group of people
behind him. “I’ve already given them their instructions. They are
absolutely reliable. There are two peak Wanxiang Adepts and a hundred
Zifu Disciples. Young master Youngflame, if there is anything you
need, just give them their instructions. Oh, and both of the Wanxiang
Adepts are two-clawed Raindragon Guards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two-clawed
Raindragon Guards?” Youngflame Nong nodded after hearing this.
Someone capable of becoming a two-clawed Raindragon Guard had to at
least be comparable to Primal Daoists; they could be considered
useful. As for the hundred Zifu Disciples? They’d be nothing more
than cannon fodder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bu You pays his
respects to you, young master Youngflame,” a messy-haired youth
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xue Hongyi pays his
respects to you, young master Youngflame,” a red-robed youth
saluted respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong nodded
lightly. “I’ll have to trouble the two of you this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is our honor to
be able to toil in your service, young master Youngflame,” Xue
Hongyi and Adept Bu You both responded with modesty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Yin, on the
other side, spoke out as well. “I’ve also arranged for ten
Wanxiang Adepts and a hundred Zifu Disciples. They are all Deathsworn
and completely loyal. Perhaps the ten Wanxiang Adepts are not
comparable to Xue Hongyi and Bu You, but if they join
forces…generally speaking, even Primal Daoists would have to give
them a wide berth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deathsworn?”
Youngflame Nong’s eyes instantly lit up and he revealed a smile.
Generally speaking, it was extremely hard to make an Immortal
cultivator become a suicide soldier, a Deathsworn; generally
speaking, one would first train a normal person into becoming a
Deathsworn, and then teach them cultivation! However, given the
mindset of a Deathsworn, it would be very hard for them to advance
very far on the path of Immortal cultivation…and thus, for
Northmont Yin to be able to deliver ten Wanxiang-level Deathsworn was
a major gift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, although
Immortal Eastrock had arranged for Xue Hongyi and Bu You to assist,
they were clearly there to assist him, not to be suicide soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my son,
Northmont Fox. He’s never met you, young master Youngflame, but
he’s long heard of your great fame. This time, he repeatedly begged
me to let him come and let him see you in person, young master
Youngflame,” Northmont Yin said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects to you,
young master Youngflame.” Northmont Fox was incomparably excited
and he quickly spoke his respects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong nodded
gently. “Northmont Fox. Mm. I’ll remember your name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A simple phrase, but it
caused Fox to feel incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This trip of mine to
Stillwater Commandery is part of a small test the clan has arranged
for me.” Youngflame Nong looked towards Immortal Eastrock and
Northmont Yin. “Thus, it isn’t appropriate for me to cause too
much of a stir here. With these helpers you two have given me, my
chances of success are now increased. I can’t be too slack in
addressing this trial; thus, I won’t stay here any longer. There’s
no need for the rest of you to send me off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we will wait to
congratulate you on your triumphant return, young master Youngflame,
and then celebrate with you.” Northmont Yin and Immortal Eastrock
both watched as Youngflame Nong’s group departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Northmont Yin,
Northmont Fox, and Immortal Eastrock were left by this teleportation
array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, those old
servants who were in charge of maintaining the teleport array were
present as well. However, when they were chatting, Immortal Eastrock
had naturally used elemental energy to block out all sound, and so
the old servants had no idea who had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, we gifted
him with Deathsworn…he’s just going to leave like that?” Fox
gave his father a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yin glanced back at his
son. “Consider yourself lucky that he accepted them. He is
currently in the middle of his trials and just so happens to need
helpers, and so he’ll accept them. In the future, when he becomes
the next Godplume Duke, he’ll become a person capable of easily
impacting the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. By then, he’d view our gift
with contempt. Gifting him with a group of Deathsworn now is worth
more than sending a hundred groups or a thousand groups in the
future!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox seemed to
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back,”
Yin instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous, completely
dark-red warship. It seemed ancient and plain, and it soared through
the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the warship,
there were a total of six hundred Zifu Disciples and ten-plus
Wanxiang Adepts. Youngflame Nong and the skinny, black-skinned man
next to him both stood at the railing of the warship, staring at the
vast world before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xue Hongyi, Bu You,”
Youngflame Nong asked, “Who are some of the formidable figures in
Stillwater Commandery? Aside from Primal Daoists and Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from Immortals
and Primal Daoists…” Xue Hongyi said, “In our Stillwater
Commandery, the most powerful of the Wanxiang Adepts would definitely
include the most powerful geniuses that are gathered at the
Black-White College. Of course the Skysplitter Sword Sect, the
Bluewood tribe, and the Dragonhunter clan also have their own elites.
I am afraid that being able to convince these true core members of
these forces to risk their lives would be quite hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong nodded
lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi was one of
the most talented younger members of Snowdragon Mountain. However,
because Snowdragon Mountain, in the grand scheme of things, was a
small sect, Xue Hongyi was willing to serve as a servant in front of
noble carriage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those even more
talented geniuses, however, wouldn’t necessarily be able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The nearby
Adept Bu You’s eyes lit up. “It seems we’ve reached Swallow
Mountain. There is a peerless genius in Swallow Mountain, one of the
truly top-tier Wanxiang members of the Black-White College. He is
Adept Darknorth, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing Ji Ning’s
name, Xue Hongyi frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
Youngflame Nong revealed a look of curiosity as well.
</P>

Chapter 2 - Power Makes Major Powers!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never heard
of him. Bu You, you tell me; what is so special about this person?”
Youngflame Nong asked with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi stood to one
side. Although he wasn’t happy, he could only hide his resentment
in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person is a
genius of the art of the sword. When he first entered the Black-White
College, he defeated several of his senior fellow disciples in Dao
Debates. In the end, it was a reincarnated Immortal, the Rainbowflame
Fairy Yu Wei who defeated him. And now, he has only grown even more
formidable! Not too long ago, he even defeated one of the three
Primal Daoists of Snowdragon Mountain, Daoist Snowplume!” Adept Bu
You said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon
Mountain?” Youngflame Nong looked at the nearby Xue Hongyi.
“Hongyi, you are of Snowdragon Mountain, yes? Did this happen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi felt
extremely stifled, but in the end, he said in a low voice, “It
did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What level is Daoist
Snowplume at?” Youngflame Nong asked. He lived in the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty; how could he possibly know about
the Primal Daoists of a small sect in Stillwater, such as Snowdragon
Mountain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi said in a
low voice, “Peak Primal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…this Ji
Ning is worth paying a visit to.” Youngflame Nong laughed and
nodded. This trip was an important trial the clan had assigned him,
and in fact, they wouldn’t even provide him with much support. The
only person he brought out from the clan was the old servant,
Xiangliu Fang, who had protected him since he was a child. As for any
other subordinates, he had to have others ‘volunteer’ them to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This trial was actually
quite a difficult one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old servant had to
stay next to him and protect him, and so he still needed formidable
subordinates. To invite a Primal Daoist or an Immortal? Youngflame
Nong didn’t feel safe doing so, because some powerful Primal
Daoists and Immortals, given their combat ability, could instantly
kill him! He absolutely would not permit this sort of a threat to
exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, he would only ask
Wanxiang Adepts. No matter how powerful a Wanxiang Adept was…their
power was within the realm of what he could handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, some extremely
powerful Primal Daoists were outside of that realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is impossible to
tell how powerful a person is just by looking at them. Even if a
Primal Daoist might be little-known, no one could know how many
secret arts he might be actually hiding. It was best to invite
Wanxiang Adepts! It was safer, and within his realm of control.
However, the more powerful a Wanxiang Adept, the harder it would be
to invite them to come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, this Ji Ning has trained for less than thirty years. I
imagine he might be quite hard to invite,” Xue Hongyi said
hurriedly. “In addition, he’s also very arrogant. He didn’t
even show my Snowdragon Mountain any face at all. If we just go and
ask him, he might be discourteous…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, he wouldn’t
give your Snowdragon Mountain face, so you think he won’t give me
face?” Youngflame Nong gave him a glance. “Hongyi, I can tell
that there are some grudges between your clan and him. However, since
you’ve come to assist me, then you don’t need to think about
those things for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi had no
choice but to lower his head and say, “Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s take a
look at this Ji Ning.” Youngflame Nong smiled, filled with
anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island. Within a study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
writing calligraphy, one character at a time. Autumn Leaf was by his
side, accompanying him and grinding hink for him. Ninelotus stood to
one side, watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put down his
brush, revealing a hint of a smile. Writing calligraphy truly was a
form of enjoyment for him, especially when he incorporated his
insights into the sword into them. This sort of feeling was truly
pleasurable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf, take it
and burn it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
Autumn Leaf immediately began to roll up the scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf,”
Ninelotus said, “Take it and burn it in a nearby room. I have some
things to discuss with Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf nodded,
then obediently left. In the room, only Ji Ning and Ninelotus were
left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What secrets do you
wish to discuss, that you need to avoid Autumn Leaf?” Ning hung the
brush in its holder, then glanced at Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus looked at
Ning. “Ji Ning, don’t you feel as though…you are a bit too
friendly and intimate with Autumn Leaf?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, there’s
not much of a difference between the way you treat Autumn Leaf and
the way you treat me.” Ninelotus looked at Ji Ning. “I’m your
Dao-Companion. She’s just your maid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
began to laugh. “You are over-thinking things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not,”
Ninelotus said quickly. “I’m not as jealous and small-minded as
you are thinking. However, in the future, it is guaranteed that you
will become more and more powerful, and your status will become
higher and higher. More and more people will follow you as well. With
so many subordinates…how are you going to properly manage them?
With rules, that’s how. How can you go without rules? There must be
a clear distinction between those with high status and those with low
status. Autumn Leaf is a maid? Then she’s a maid! If you don’t
distinguish between those of high and low status, then everything
will be a mess!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything she had
learned within the Dongyan clan caused Ninelotus to believe that one
had to clearly distinguish between exalted and humble statuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Servants were servants!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if you doted on a
particular servant, a servant still had to act the part of a servant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you trying
to say?” Ning began to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just want to tell
you that in the future, as you grow increasingly powerful, the Ji
clan will also slowly grow powerful. A major clan needs to look like
and operate like a major clan. As the supreme power behind this major
power…you need to be even more careful in distinguishing between
the statuses of those by your side!” Ninelotus said. “And you?
Enough about Autumn Leaf for now; you even converse with those
ordinary servants? You chit-chat with them? Those are just ordinary
mortal servants. Why pay them any attention at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly snapped,
“Enough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone has their
own way of handling their affairs. As for Autumn Leaf, although she
is a maid, in my heart, she’s my older sister!” Ning looked at
Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus gritted her
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had lived in
different environments, and Ning, in his previous life, had come from
Earth. Naturally, there would be major differences in the ways they
viewed and handled things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future,
people are going to laugh at you if you act this way!” Ninelotus
said with a frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Laugh at me? Who
will laugh at me?” Ning looked at Ninelotus. “In fact, why should
I even care about if others laugh at me? I’m me. When my fame truly
reaches the point of shaking the entire Grand Xia Dynasty, others
will most likely revere every single word I say and thing I do.
Ninelotus, can it be that you still haven’t seen through these
things? A True Immortal, even one of low and despicable moral
character…in the end, the various tribes will all lower their heads
to lap at his feet. If, however, he was nothing but an ordinary
mortal, even if his every word and action was keeping in accord with
the rules of your so-called ‘major clans’, in the end, he’ll be
nothing more than a joke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Expand your horizons
to include the entire Three Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personal power is
the most important fundament! Only when you have power, will you
become a major power!” Ning stared at Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus could sense
the powerful determination and the wild ambition in Ning’s eyes.
She lowered her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I won’t
speak of this anymore. In the future, you’ll understand.”
Ninelotus turned her head, moving to walk outside. But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful ripple
spread out from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and
Ninelotus both turned their heads, staring towards the distant skies.
They could both sense the ripple. Although they had just had an
argument, they still flew together towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair. Ning,
Ninelotus, Northson, Yu Wei, and Adept Vastriver had all flown here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?” Ning
saw the ancient, plain-looking warship hanging in the skies far away.
Atop the warship, a flag was fluttering with two characters on it -
‘Young’ ‘Flame’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong!”
Ninelotus was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame
clan?” Adept Vastriver was similarly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, Northson,
and Yu Wei, they hadn’t even heard of this clan before. Clearly,
they were befuddled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver
hurriedly sent to them, “Be careful, fellow disciples. This
Youngflame clan ranks amongst the top ten powerful clans in the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty. Many of their clansmen are officials
serving the Grand Xia Dynasty, and they are extremely influential in
this major world. Within their clan, there are three Marquisates, and
these three marquisdoms vastly outstrip Stillwater Commandery in
size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus hurriedly
sent as well, “The Youngflame clan’s territory, in terms of size,
is nearly a hundred times that of Stillwater Commandery! Their roots
are incredibly deep; supposedly, shortly after this major world was
created, the Youngflame clan had already begun to grow and prosper.
In the incomparably distant Fiendgod Era, the Youngflame clan was an
incomparably mighty force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and Yu
Wei were stunned upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s too
badass…” Northson blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three marquisdoms in
a single tribe?” Ning had reviewed a map of the entire Grand Xia
Dynasty; amongst them, there were indeed three marquisdoms that were
marked with ‘Youngflame clan’. These three marquisdoms were
spread out in different areas, but each of them were vast; they were
all extremely large marquisdoms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has the warship
of such a powerful clan appeared at my Serpentwing Lake?” Ning was
completely puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, a long
corridor suddenly opened up from within that ancient, plain warship.
An azure-robed man emerged, followed by a swarthy, tall, slender-eyed
middle-aged man. Behind them was Xue Hongyi, Bu You, and a group of
Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xue Hongyi?” Ning
immediately recognized him. Xue Hongyi gave Ning a glance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be
careful,” Ninelotus hurriedly sent. “This azure-robed youth…he’s
one of the Four Dukelings of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, ‘Youngflame Nong’. Youngflame Nong’s status is
extraordinary; unless something unexpected happens, he’ll be the
next leader of the Youngflame clan, the next Godplume Duke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, Adept
Vastriver, and Yu Wei were all secretly tongue-tied. The next leader
of the Youngflame clan? He was this incredible?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dongyan Yun greets
you, young master Youngflame,” Ninelotus said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know me?”
Youngflame Nong said, surprised, “Dongyan Yun? Can it be that you
are ‘Ninelotus’ of the Dongyan clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely so.”
Ninelotus nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong smiled
and nodded. He had been carefully reared since young, and was quite
familiar with some of the most important figures of the supreme
powers of this the Grand Xia Dynasty’s world. Ninelotus was the
next leader of the Dongyan clan ; naturally, he was familiar with
her. Although he had learned of her long ago, after reflecting
slightly, he remembered everything about her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus, you are
far more beautiful than the painting I saw. In the painting, you were
far more youthful,” Youngflame Nong said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus laughed, then
said, “Let me make the introductions for you, young master
Youngflame. This is my Dao-Companion, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companion?”
Youngflame Nong was startled, and then he nodded. “A perfect
pairing, to be sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my senior
apprentice-sister, the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei. She is also a
reincarnated Immortal.” Ninelotus next pointed to the black-robed
Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
eyes immediately lit up. Ninelotus could be said to be an extremely
beautiful and graceful woman, but the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei, was
even superior to her. She caused even the eyes of Youngflame Nong,
who usually stayed in the imperial capital, to light up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my senior
apprentice-brother, Adept Vastriver, also a reincarnated Immortal.
And this is my junior apprentice-brother, Mu Northson,” Ninelotus
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ninelotus
finished her words…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
young master Youngflame,” Ning, Northson, Yu Wei, and Adept
Vastriver said in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong nodded
as well. He could tell that this group was an extraordinary one. Next
to him, Adept Bu You secretly sent him a mental message.
“Congratulations, young master Youngflame. The Rainbowflame Fairy
and Adept Vastriver are amongst the most supreme geniuses of the
Black-White College; they are easily comparable to Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong looked
towards their group, then said with a smile, “Come to think of it,
I actually do have something to ask you to help out with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group
exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, please speak,” Ning said.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_3___Witchriver_Immortal"></A>
Chapter 3 - Witchriver Immortal Estate!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong said,
“This is a small test my clan has given me. They’ve charged me
with investigating an ancient Immortal estate. As for whether or not
I’m able to acquire the aid of others, the clan won’t care! I
won’t lie to you; this Immortal estate belonged to a Celestial
Immortal. Although he died countless years ago, his estate is filled
with many dangers, and the Diremonsters who were trapped within have
constantly propagated. I imagine that there are quite a few monsters
living there now…and there are some unknown dangers as well. Thus,
I need some helpers. If you are willing to help me, then I will
remember this favor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words caused the
faces of Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Ninelotus, Yu Wei, and Adept Vastriver
to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate of a
Celestial Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the vast world
was covered with countless Immortal estates, those generally belonged
to Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals. Estates of Loose Immortals or
Earth Immortals might be quite alluring to ordinary Zifu Disciples,
but they were much less intriguing to the likes of Ning’s group;
after all, Ning’s group had constant access to many living Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals. For example, Ning’s master was
Immortal Diancai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a Celestial
Immortal’s estate? That was completely different!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, what do
you think?” Adept Vastriver sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sent,
“Youngflame Nong is one of the Four Dukelings of the imperial
capital; given his status, if he says he will remember this favor, he
definitely will. For the sake of this favor along…I feel that we
can help him. Once he becomes the next Godplume Duke, if he is
willing to help us out even slightly, we will benefit tremendously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not rush
into it. I feel that the servant next to him is extremely dangerous,”
Ning sent. His subconscious had begun to warn of him a tremendous
threat long ago, and the threat came from that servant. “If he has
such a formidable helper already, why does he need our help? Let’s
not rush into it and ask a bit more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm, makes sense,”
Adept Vastriver concurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll follow you,
senior apprentice-brother,” Northson said simply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait and see
first,” Yu Wei agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ninelotus was
more inclined towards accepting, clearly, Ning’s influence was a
bit stronger within this group. The main reason was because, when a
group of geniuses were together, they would value ability the most.
The most powerful of their group was Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and Vastriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong could
tell from the looks on the faces of Ning and the rest that they
hadn’t yet been convinced. He thus continued, “This Celestial
Immortal was known as Immortal Witchriver! He was an aquatic
Diremonster who gained insight into the Dao and became a Celestial
Immortal. In the past, his fame was widespread. Afterwards, he fought
with other Immortals of the Three Realms and perished. The key to his
Immortal estate was acquired by my Youngflame clan. However, my clan
was in no rush to investigate. That’s why I’m certain that after
Immortal Witchriver died, nobody has entered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, this
Immortal estate is the lair of a Celestial Immortal; it definitely
has many precious items inside, such as spirit-herbs, precious magic
treasures, spirit-pills, unique refining materials, and more. There
might even be Immortal-ranked magic treasures within!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Yu Wei and
Adept Vastriver’s eyes were shining. Ning and Northson couldn’t
help but feel stirred as well. An Immortal-ranked magic treasure?
Right…the vast majority of Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals
didn’t have Immortal-ranked magic treasures, but Celestial
Immortals definitely would, and not just one! It was very possible
that they might leave one behind in their homes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My goal is to
achieve mastery of this Immortal estate; as for the treasures within,
so long as you can acquire them, they will be yours. I definitely
won’t fight with you for them. Even if I truly want them, I’ll
give you a satisfactory offer for them and won’t force you.”
Youngflame Nong looked towards Ning’s group. “This is my promise,
and the promise of the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group
exchanged glances with each other while secretly sending mental
messages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can go take a
look,” Adept Vastriver sent. “Entering a Celestial Immortal’s
estate is a rare opportunity to begin with. It is just as young
master Youngflame said…without the key to the estate, there’s no
way to enter at all. It’s a rare opportunity for us to enter
alongside him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s the young
master of the Youngflame clan…the Youngflame clan’s promises are
worth trusting,” Yu Wei sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll follow you,
senior apprentice-brother.” Northson’s words were the same as
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
Ninelotus looked towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued as
well now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong look at
them, then added, “Based on what I know, although Immortal
Witchriver was a Diremonster, he was a Diremonster Sword Immortal,
and had an extremely high level of insight into the Dao of the Sword.
I imagine that his sword technique must be recorded down within his
home.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has been moved,” Adept Vastriver
sent with a laugh. “Everyone, let’s decide…should we go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can make the
trip,” Yu Wei said. “Although it will be dangerous…if the
Youngflame clan is willing to allow their young master to go, the
danger level shouldn’t be too ridiculous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Ninelotus
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look,” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, I’ll go as
well.” Northson revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver was the
oldest of the group, and so he was the one to speak out. “Young
master Youngflame, the five of us are willing to accompany you to the
Witchriver Immortal Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, excellent!”
Youngflame Nong’s eyes were shining. He clapped his hands, then
said happily, “With the help of the five of you, I will definitely
succeed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, if there
are any preparations you need to make, make them quickly,”
Youngflame Nong said hurriedly. “We need to head to the Witchriver
Immortal Estate as soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re all free,”
Adept Vastriver said with a laugh. “I’m afraid that junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning might need to make some minor
arrangements, however.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you go make your arrangements. We’ll
wait for you here,” Northson laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were guests;
naturally, they could leave at any time. Ning, however, had to make
some arrangements for his clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, please
wait a few moments.” Ning immediately transformed into a streak of
light, flying towards Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart Island.
Autum Leaf, Little Qing, and the Whitewater Hound had been waiting
here the entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Who is that person?” Little Qing asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Autumn Leaf. “Autumn Leaf, the person who came on that warship is a
young master of an ancient, powerful clan known as the Youngflame
clan. He’s asked us to help him carry out some matters…I need to
temporarily leave for a period of time. I’ll hand everything on
Brightheart Island over to you to handle. As for the Ji clan, help me
send word that I’ll return soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Autumn
Leaf nodded obediently. Whatever Ning wanted to do, Autumn Leaf would
quietly support.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, Little
Qing, Uncle White,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re off!”
Little Qing instantly transformed into a streak of mist, then
reformed and wrapped herself around Ning’s arm as a little snake.
As for the Whitewater Hound, he just quietly padded along besides
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In going out and
adventuring, one would naturally bring one’s spirit-beasts along.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see how
incredible this Celestial Immortal’s estate is.” Ning felt a bit
eager. Suddenly, he had a thought; “It’s best to be cautious. I
should bring that treasure along and carry it on me. Supposedly,
there are some places where magic treasures cannot be taken out of
storage-type magic treasures.” A black armband appeared around,
then wrapped itself around Ning’s arm. His magic clothing, in the
appearance of furs, quickly covered it, making it disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black armband was
one of the two major unique items which Ning had acquired from the
underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still felt quite
confident of his chances in this trip to the Celestial Immortal’s
estate. He had overcome the fourth level of the Wargod Hall and had
reached the Wanxiang level as a Fiendgod Refiner…the two treasure
selection chances he had gained, Ning had used to choose protective
items, not Earth-ranked magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what the giant
yellow bear had said: “It’s best to be careful. In the past,
Rampart died at the Wanxiang Adept level. The Wanxiang level…it’s
neither high nor low; you aren’t a weakling, but you also aren’t
a true power yet either. It’s the level with the highest chance of
death. Although this protective item can only be used once, its power
is extraordinary. You can view it as a second life for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third time Ning had
chosen a treasure, the giant yellow bear had said something similar:
“This unique protective is the most suited for you; in the past,
Daoist Threelives felt a sudden moment of interest and personally
fashioned it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the
Nethercold Swords which Ning had chosen the first time, Ning had used
his other chances to choose protective treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the set of Nethercold Swords, in and of itself, was already an
extremely valuable treasure. It vastly surpassed the protective
treasure which Immortal Diancai had previously given Ning; that
protective treasure, for the current Ning, was a bit lacking. The two
protective treasures which Ning chose this time, however…were no
lower in value than the Nethercold Swords. Given that they were
assessed by the underwater estate as top-grade, they were naturally
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With these two
protective treasures, I should have enough resources to deal with any
sudden, unexpected dangers,” Ning mused to himself. “Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a little azure
serpent around his arm, and a Whitewater Hound by his side. He
immediately flew into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you also
have spirit-beasts?” Youngflame Nong, who was waiting for him on
the warship, immediately laughed upon seeing the little azure snake
on Ning’s arm. “I have one as well. Come on out, Crimsonfire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a
crimson-headed serpent reared its head, emerging from the skin on
Nong’s arm. This crimson serpent had a single horn on its head, and
its eyes were gold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Redscale
Salamander?” Ning and the others were all secretly shocked.
Godbeasts had the blood of Fiendgods, but there were differences
amongst Godbeasts; normal Godbeasts were capable of transforming at
the Zifu level, such as the Whitewater Hound and the Azure Skysnake!
However, according to legend, some truly powerful Godbeasts would
only be able to transform into human form after becoming Celestial
Immortals. Those Godbeasts were truly fearsome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redscale Salamanders
were extremely famous; they had to at least reach the Primal level
before being able to transform! They were far more exalted than Azure
Skysnakes and Whitewater Hounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hisssss.” The
Redscale Salamander gave the Azure Skysnake and the Whitewater Hound
a glance, then buried its head once more into Nong’s skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Crimsonfire
still isn’t able to take human form, so he’s quite depressed.”
Youngflame Nong sat at the highest, principal seat of the warship,
with Ning and the others seated below him. “Come, come, come. Let’s
drink together. After we enter the Witchriver Immortal Estate, we
won’t be as relaxed as we are now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A toast to you,
young master Youngflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver, Ning,
Northson, Yu Wei, and Ninelotus all raised their cups. As for Xue
Hongyi and Bu You, who were seated at the very bottom, they also
raised their cups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Youngflame Nong’s laughter rang out. Clearly, he was in an
exceedingly good mood. And why wouldn’t he be? Although Xue Hongyi
and Bu You were both two-clawed Raindragon Guards, compared to Ji
Ning, the most brilliant genius of the Black-White College, and
compared to the two reincarnated Immortals, Yu Wei and Adept
Vastriver, Bu You and Hongyi were on a lower level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His casual detour to
Swallow Mountain’s Serpentwing Lake had resulted in five more
helpers, each of whom were extraordinary! Even the slightly weaker Mu
Northson was a genius of the Dao of Constructs. Those who walked the
Dao of Constructs were innately skilled at fighting those who were of
a higher level. In turn, Ninelotus was the next leader of the Dongyan
clan; how could she not be in possession of some powerful protective
items?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They drank and made
merry with each other. After just two days, they arrived at the place
where the Witchriver Immortal Estate was hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Witchriver
Immortal Estate is in the distant Skyrove Mountains.” Youngflame
Nong, standing at the front of the ship, pointed towards a distant,
towering mountain range. He seemed quite resplendent and valiant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
followed his gaze, filled with anticipation as well.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Seize_It"></A>
Chapter 4 - Seize It
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skyrove Mountains
were vast and endless, covering an expanse of more than a hundred
thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Witchriver
Immortal Estate is hidden within these mountains. Even if one was to
rely on divine sense to search for it, it would take weeks.”
Youngflame Nong had a hint of anticipation in his eyes. “However, I
have the key to the estate; so long as we draw close to it, I’ll be
able to sense it. Everyone, make your preparations; after we enter
the Immortal estate, things will truly grow dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Immortal
cultivators all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are finally going
to go in.” Mu Northson’s eyes were shining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The abode of
a Celestial Immortal.” Ning felt quite eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
nearby Ninelotus stealthily sent him a message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
Ninelotus, revealing a smile. He sent back, “Senior
apprentice-sister, what’s this about? Why are you sending me a
mental message?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After entering the
Immortal estate, you need to reveal your prowess, and also actively
move to be more friendly to young master Youngflame. To be able to
meet him is a rare opportunity; if you let it slip, it’ll be hard
to gain it again in the future,” Ninelotus instructed. “You
wasted both of the past two days. After entering the Immortal estate,
you can’t continue to be so remiss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “Senior
apprentice-sister!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be angry,”
Ninelotus said. “I know your temper; you don’t like to flatter
others, but I’m not asking you to do that. I’m just asking you to
be a bit more friendly…Ji Ning, you should know that you are far
more powerful than Xue Hongyi, but during the past two days on the
warship, Xue Hongyi often engaged young master Youngflame in
conversation, and he has a much closer relationship to him than you
do, as of right now. You always just stand there, not saying a
thing…this is really…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, I…” Ning wanted to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me finish.”
Ninelotus looked at Ji Ning. “Relationship-building…the reason
why it is called relationship-building is because you need to build
up a relationship between the two of you, which is accomplished
through interacting with each other. That’s the only way you can
build up a relationship with him. Don’t think that just because you
helped him out that you’ll have much of a relationship; that’s
just a favor, nothing more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When a favor is used
up, it’s gone. But a relationship is long-lasting!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are arrogant and
aloof by nature; you don’t like to flatter others. But young master
Youngflame is even more arrogant than you! As a result, the two of
you barely interact with each other. Let me ask you this; if you were
young master Youngflame…how much of a relationship would you feel
that you have with a person who won’t even talk to you? Even if
this person helped you, I imagine that you wouldn’t care too much
about him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
Ninelotus’ words did indeed have merit to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human relationships
can be divided into several categories; strangers, familiar faces,
friends, close friends, and lifelong friends,” Ninelotus said.
“You’ve only said one or two things to each other; to be honest,
you and young master Youngflame can’t even be considered ‘familiar
faces’; you continue to be strangers to each other. As for Xue
Hongyi, he often chats with young master Youngflame. Afterwards, he
is going to risk his life for him. Perhaps they might end up becoming
friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you enter the
Immortal estate, perhaps you might end up rendering more merits..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in young master
Youngflame’s heart, he’ll feel closer to Xue Hongyi, not you.
Right now, because young master Youngflame needs your help for this
trial, he’s fairly courteous to you. But after he completes it, and
especially after he becomes the next Godplume Duke…I imagine that
he wouldn’t even be bothered to cast you a single glance. If you
ask him to help out, if it’s a small matter, he might nod and
return the favor, but if what you ask is too troublesome, he might
not even receive you. Even an Immortal might find it hard to meet
with the new Godplume Duke.” Ninelotus looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, I admit that your words have merit,” Ning sent
back. “Favors, once repaid, are gone. Relationships are indeed
long-lasting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…you are
you, and I am me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t like to go
and intentionally try to befriend someone. Let everything happen
naturally,” Ning sent. “If I can become friends with young master
Youngflame, that will naturally be a good thing. But if we cannot be
friends, that’s fine as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A fortuitous
encounter! That’s what this is, and you have to seize it!”
Ninelotus sent urgently, “How many major figures will you run into
in your life? If you miss this chance, it’ll be gone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In taking the
Immortal path, one will have to rely on one’s self.” Ning shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if someone helps
you out at a critical moment, you’ll be able to move farther on
your Immortal path,” Ninelotus sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, if I were to intentionally go and befriend or
ingratiate myself to someone, it will only impact my Dao-heart…in
the end, it would be a loss,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ninelotus
was furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone has their
own Dao. Senior apprentice-sister, there’s no need for you to try
and force things,” Ning said. “Senior apprentice-sister…I’ve
never tried to force you to do anything. I hope you won’t try to
force me to do anything either. This is the second time now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was stunned.
Right. Not too long ago, the two of you had squabbled at Brightheart
Island over the matter of differentiation of statuses. That was the
very first squabble the two had ever had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just trying to
help you accomplish greater things in the future.” Ninelotus’
eyes were turning slightly red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, alright.”
Ning took Ninelotus by the hand, smiling towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Yu Wei,
noticing that Ji Ning and Ninelotus were holding hands, frowned very
slightly. And then, she turned her head, staring towards the distant,
vast mountains outside the ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is Ji Ning so
lucky?” Xue Hongyi glanced from the corner of his eyes at the
hand-holding Ji Ning and Ninelotus, then cursed to himself, “This
trip of young master Youngflame to the Immortal estate clearly didn’t
have anything to do with Ji Ning, but now he’s been invited to
participate as well. In addition, he actually ended up becoming
Dao-Companions with Dongyan Yun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi, at first,
had no idea about Ninelotus’ background. However, over the course
of the past two days on the ship together, Youngflame Nong had
chatted with Ninelotus, and from their conversations, Xue Hongyi had
learned…that Ninelotus was actually the next leader of the Dongyan
clan. Instantly, Xue Hongyi felt incomparably jealous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That brat from the
Ji clan ended up reaching such a level…” Xue Hongyi couldn’t
help but feel envy in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When news had spread of
Ning defeating Daoist Snowplume, Xue Hongyi could scarcely believe
it. He couldn’t believe that the little punk who he could’ve
obliterated with ease a few years ago had become even more powerful
than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, Ji Ning had
also gotten to know Youngflame Nong, and had become Dao-Companions
with Ninelotus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really hope this
Ji Ning will die in the Witchriver Immortal Estate!” Xue Hongyi
mused secretly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ship flew through
the air above the Skyrove Mountains for the amount of time needed to
boil a kettle of tea. Suddenly, the azure-robed Youngflame Nong’s
eyes lit up as he stared downwards. “The Immortal estate is
directly below us. Everyone, follow me inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve found the
Immortal estate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right below us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experts, previously
still chatting casually, all focused their attention below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship shot
downwards, quickly gliding past the mountain peaks and flying into an
extremely deep gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient warship
came to a halt in the air before one of the cliff walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait for me to
unlock the Immortal estate first.” Youngflame Nong produced a
golden talisman in his hand. He pointed it towards the distant cliff,
then used his elemental ki to activate the talisman. Rumble…the
golden talisman instantly emitted a hazy golden pillar of light which
illuminated the stone wall. The surface of the stone wall immediately
began to twist and change, soon revealing an enormous, rippling,
watery surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.” Youngflame
Nong revealed a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship flew
directly in, passing through the watery, rippling surface, then
disappearing within it. Immediately afterwards, the rippling surface
disappeared as well. The stone wall remained a stone wall, with
nothing special about it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group, aboard
the warship, flew through the watery surface, then saw the scene in
front of them rapidly change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ji
Ning and the others aboard the warship saw the area around them be
filled with a connected range of mountains. The mountain peaks were
dreary and cold, as though nothing could thrive on them. As for the
ground, it was a lifeless desert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skyrove Mountains
was a living, thriving mountain range. But upon entering this
Immortal estate…what they saw was this desolate desert and the
mountains above it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, a series
of loud, earthshaking sounds rang out. The sounds rang out from a
distant mountain peak, the most towering of the mountains present.
The top of the mountain was completely covered by white patches.
These white objects were Diremonsters, dressed in snowy white armor,
which were clustered together, forming the various white patches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These snowy white
armored Diremonsters all had enormous fish-like tails and human
bodies; their faces were covered with scales.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
Diremonsters all turned their heads in unison towards Ji Ning’s
group, because the ripple caused by the warship passing through the
watery surface had been detected by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are humans!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand-plus
merfolk, who were in the midst of training, all called out in shock.
How many years had it been? Ever since their ancestors had been
trapped within here, unable to escape, they had bred countless
generations of descendants. The entirety of this Immortal estate
world was filled with monsters; there wasn’t even a single human
present. In fact, the late Immortal Witchriver himself was born a
monster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The leader of
the training Diremonsters, an alluring-looking female merfolk with a
naked upper body, was stunned…but then, her shrill voice bellowed
out, “Humans! Humans have entered the Immortal estate! They
definitely have the key to the estate…quick, quick, seize it from
them, seize the key of the estate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me and kill
them!” The female merfolk immediately manifested a set of golden
armor over her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she charged towards
the sky, the thousand snowy-white armored merfolk Diremonsters all
followed from behind. The runes on the Dao-armors they were wearing
all began to glow as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…these thousand
Diremonsters suddenly formed into an enormously massive, sky-filling
wave. This vast, endless wave rolled forward, smashing towards
Youngflame Nong and his group, aboard the distant warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once we seize the
key to the estate, we’ll be able to escape. Take it!” The female
merfolk bellowed mentally, causing the other merfolk Diremonsters
behind her to bellow with fury as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain peak was
only a few dozen kilometers away from Ning’s group. Precisely
because of how close it was, these merfolk Diremonsters were able to
immediately ascertain that they were humans! This was the very first
time this unfathomably ancient Immortal estate had humans appear
within it..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few dozen
kilometers…it only took a few breaths to traverse this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the warship,
Youngflame Nong, Ji Ning, Xue Hongyi, and the others were all
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-soldiers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monstrous
Dao-soldiers!” They were all shocked. They had all seen, from far
away, that there were quite a few Wanxiang Diremonsters amongst the
crowd of beasts, and that female merfolk leader was very possibly a
Primal Diremonster! Even the weakest monster in the group was at the
Zifu level. And with all of them also being Dao-soldiers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Dao-armors
must have been left behind by Immortal Witchriver for building up an
army of Dao-soldiers.” Ning and the others all realized that they
were in for quite a bit of trouble now.

Chapter 5 - Unblockable
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Immortal estate
was the home of Immortal Witchriver; naturally, he had set up layers
of defenses. Although he himself had perished, some of the defenses
he had left behind remained usable; for example, his Dao-soldiers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchriver had
used up countless treasures in order to cultivate a powerful army of
Dao-soldiers. In their most powerful prime, they were capable of
easily killing a Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal! However, the
Immortal estate had suffered through countless years of decay. Those
oldest monstrous Dao-soldiers had died long ago, leaving behind a
large amount of Dao-soldier armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ji Ning
and the others had guessed that as Immortal Witchriver was a monster
Immortal, it was only logical to expect that he had stationed some of
his race within his Immortal estate. This Immortal estate
world…although it wasn’t as infinitely vast as the Grand Xia
Empire, it still spanned tens of thousands of kilometers, and was
comparable in size to Earth. Thus, the monsters had continuously
propagated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters had left
behind their training methods to their descendants, while the
Immortal estate itself had incomparably dense, nourishing levels of
elemental energy. It was only normal for more Diremonsters to be
created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An host of
Diremonsters…and a host of monstrous Dao-soldiers…these were two
completely different concepts! With precious Dao-armors equipped,
their power would explode tenfold or even a hundredfold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clans like the Ji clan
also had Dao-armor suitable for mortals to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao-armor usable by
Xiantian lifeforms and Zifu Disciples, however, were much more rare.
Generally speaking, schools on the level of Snowdragon Mountain would
have them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Dao-armor which
Wanxiang Adepts and Primal Daoists could use? Even sects like the
Skysplitter Sword Sect would have to use all their ability and spend
enormous amounts of precious resources to procure such Dao-armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, right now…Ji
Ning’s group was in serious trouble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble….” A
thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers swept forward, having transformed
into a vast wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong, aboard
the warship, let out a furious roar. Faced with a thousand monstrous
Dao-soldiers, even he had an ugly look on his face now. A watery,
rippling layer of black light appeared on the surface of the warship,
completely protecting it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The edges of that vast,
surging wave slashed against the warship like blades, causing the
entire warship to be flipped over and sent flying backwards, smashing
viciously against a nearby mountain peak. The entire mountain rang
out from the sound of the collision, while the warship itself plunged
deep into it. The black, watery curtain of protective light had
completely dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, what
should we do?” Youngflame Nong sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
combined, full-strength attack from those thousand Dao-soldiers was
comparable to a Loose Immortal’s might.” The black, middle-aged
man next to Youngflame Nong sent mentally, “That merwoman
leader…she is definitely a Primal Diremonsters. My priority is
definitely going to be staying close to you and protecting you. After
all, I’m only skilled at close combat; if I were to charge out,
then I would no longer be able to protect you. Let the others go face
them. I’ll wait for a good opportunity; once I seize it and kill
that leading Primal merwoman…then the other Dao-soldiers will be
much less of a threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, it’s up
to you.” Youngflame Nong sent a mental message to Ning, Xue Hongyi,
Adept Vastriver, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group were all
secretly cursing; clearly, this Youngflame Nong wouldn’t willingly
risk himself. He was having them face the danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Xue Hongyi
was the first to attack. With a sweep of his hand, he transformed
into a streak of snowy white large, charging towards the thousand
invading Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword formation!”
More than seven hundred flying swords appeared around Ji Ning. His
peak Wanxiang-level elemental ki, using the ninth level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], formed a sword of light before
him. This sword of light immediately executed the fifth stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] - Moonlight Hiding the Sword. Instantly, a
seemingly soft, gentle beam of moonlight seemed to caress the wave of
monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seal!” Yu Wei
pointed into the distance. Whoosh! An enormous ice phoenix appeared
in midair. This giant phoenix, completely formed from frozen ice,
spread its wings and flew forward, carrying a heart-shaking, majestic
aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastwave Breaker!”
Adept Vastriver let out a loud cry, but maintained his elegant and
graceful poise. An enormous black sword appeared in midair, covered
with runes. This giant black sword slashed through the skies,
chopping towards the Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group,
including the Zifu Disciples and the Wanxiang-level Deathsworn, all
released powerful techniques. Ning and the others on his level were
all capable of giving that female Primal Diremonster a good fight!
However, she was linked to the thousand Dao-soldiers, and thus was
now able to unleash astonishing levels of power, vastly surpassing
any single person in Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With an enormous
rumbling sound, their sword-light and magic techniques either
crumbled, vanished, or were knocked flying back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciples all
formed into formations, preparing to resist together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to move
fast. Fast, fast, fast! We need to take that key as soon as possible;
if we are too slow, then the key will be taken by those old
bastards,” the leading merwoman Diremonster sent mentally.
“Children, annihilate these humans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand-plus
Dao-soldiers, when joining forces, were capable of unleashing power
which no one in Ning’s group was capable of resisting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That enormous wave once
more smashed directly towards them. Ning’s group was quickly forced
to retreat, but the weaker Zifu Disciples began to perish. Although
they had formed formations…their formations, in the face of the
formation of monstrous Dao-soldiers, simply wasn’t able to hold on
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the human Zifu
Disciples spat up mouthfuls of blood. Some of their bodies crumbled.
One after another, they died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning and
the others were working to block as well. Otherwise, most likely, in
a single breath’s worth of time, all of the Zifu Disciples would
have perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too vicious,”
Northson sent mentally. “Senior apprentice-brother, that Youngflame
Nong definitely has many treasures on him, but he’s not even
willing to use a single one of them. He just watched as those Zifu
Disciples perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We just entered the
Immortal estate moments ago. It’s only natural that he wouldn’t
be willing to use his treasures right away,” Ning responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei,
Ninelotus, and the others all had their own life-saving techniques.
But nobody would choose to use them this early. After all…they had
only just entered the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong stood
there watching, with the swarthy, black-skinned man standing by his
side, protecting him. The black-skinned, middle-aged man just watched
quietly. His facial expressions didn’t change at all when their
Zifu Disciples started to die; his gaze was firmly focused on the
distant, ferocious wave of elemental power, formed by the monstrous
Dao-soldiers. The way in which the elemental ki circulated through
their formation was extremely subtle and profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-skinned man,
still by Youngflame Nong, suddenly revealed a cold light in his eyes.
A pair of sharp awls appeared in his right and left hands. He took a
sudden step forward, and his left arm began to elongate. In fact, one
long serpent after another began to appear and coil around his arm.
His left arm struck out with massive, savage power, sending the awl
flying towards the front!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long black awl
instantly pierced through the skies, leaving behind a brilliant,
eye-catching scar in the sky as it pierced directly towards the giant
wave formed from monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An explosive sound. The
massive, ferocious wave actually was blown apart! The giant wave
vanished, revealing that more than ten of the Diremonster
Dao-soldiers had been completely blasted into chunks of meat. The
other monstrous Dao-soldiers were all completely stunned, and they
all stared at the black, middle-aged man who had thrown out the long
awl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! He actually
discovered the core of our Dao-soldier formation, then shattered it
and destroyed the formation?” The merwoman Diremonster was shocked.
If the attack hadn’t struck the core, it would’ve passed through
the massive wave, not cause it to completely collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The merwoman
Diremonster turned her head, staring at the black, middle-aged man
who had thrown out the awl. But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long awl in the
middle-aged man’s right hand suddenly flashed out as well; his
right arm also became covered with long, coiling serpents, and it
became incomparably strong and muscular, emanating a terrifying,
heart-shaking aura. Once more, that dazzling, eye-catchingly
brilliant scar in the skies appeared…as the awl pierced directly
through the body of the merwoman Diremonster, who had wanted to
dodge, but was completely unable to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…” A
look of shock and despair appeared on her face. “How can he be so
powerful? I was completely unable to dodge. He, he…he’s a human
Immortal?” And then, her consciousness faded away. She fell down
from the skies, her body pierced through. She was dead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen is dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen died!
Quick, flee, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing that their
leader had been so easily killed, the other merfolk Diremonsters no
longer had any appetite for battle. All of them began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Adept
Vastriver, and the others naturally wouldn’t show mercy at a time
like this. It be must understood that these monsters were all wearing
Dao-armor, most of which was meant for Zifu Disciples, and some of
which were even usable by Wanxiang Adepts. A single set of Dao-armor
usable by Wanxiang Diremonsters was far more valuable than an
ordinary Earth-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two sets. Three
sets.” Northson didn’t hold back at all, killing one after
another and seizing as many as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining monstrous
Dao-soldiers had all fled far away, leaving behind a pile of corpses
and a heap of Dao-armors in the hands of Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We killed more than
two hundred monsters, while more than a hundred of our Zifu Disciples
died.” Youngflame Nong didn’t reveal a look of happiness on his
face at all. Although he knew all along that there would be some
danger in this trial, he hadn’t expected that his team would’ve
suffered such a thwack as soon as they entered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.” The black-skinned, middle-aged man retrieved his awls,
then said in a low voice, “Let’s hurry and leave. Perhaps even
more powerful Diremonsters will come over soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Youngflame
Nong nodded. “Let’s go.” He looked towards Ning and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep, powerful surge
of divine sense instantly encapsulated this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans, now that you
have entered the Immortal estate…are you still dreaming of leaving
alive?” A deep, sonorous voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
divine sense.” As soon as Ning’s own divine sense collided
against this person’s, he could sense how powerful it was. Although
he viewed his divine sense as his strongest attribute, he could tell
that this person vastly surpassed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, look.” Northson stared, wide-eyed, towards the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…is big
trouble.” Adept Vastriver was staring towards the distance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to looked
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There, in the distant
skies, an enormous, massive wave of water was soaring this way, like
a titanic flood that covered the heavens themselves. The size of this
massive wave was more than ten times greater than the previous
one…and the aura emanating from this massive wave was vastly more
powerful than the wave created by the merfolk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than ten
thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers!” The black-skinned, awl-wielding
man by Youngflame Nong’s side growled out in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hearts of everyone
in Ning’s group sank. More than thousand? This was comparable to
the entire Snowdragon Mountain sect. The worst thing was, each and
every one of these ten thousand Diremonsters were Dao-soldiers! There
was no way a school like Snowdragon Mountain could possibly acquire
so many Dao-armors, especially the ones which even Primal
Diremonsters could use. This level of power…it was enough to cause
even an Immortal to feel fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, I
won’t be able to block them,” the black-skinned man sent.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - Fiendgod, Hydraga
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, there’s no way we can deal with so many monstrous
Dao-soldiers,” Adept Vastriver sent hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, staring at the
titanic, sky-filling wave that had been formed by countless monstrous
Dao-soldiers, felt powerless as well. He sent, “Young master
Youngflame, what now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them looked
towards Youngflame Nong. Even the black-skinned man, Xiangliu Fang,
looked towards his young master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, don’t
worry about me. Go all out and massacre them.” Youngflame Nong
ground his teeth. Waving his hand, he produced a marvelous golden
globe of light which flew into the air, quickly growing in size until
it reached a diameter of thirty meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, get in,”
Youngflame Nong ordered. At the same time, he produced a white sack
in his other hand, which opened up. “Don’t resist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding Zifu
Disciples were all sucked into the sack, and then the sack itself was
carried by Youngflame Nong as he stepped into the golden globe of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Mu Northson,
Ninelotus, Yu Wei, Adept Vastriver, Xue Hongyi, Adept Bu You, and the
other Wanxiang adepts all flew into the golden globe of light as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, I’ll
leave this in your hands. Let’s reunite later,” Youngflame Nong
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. It’s been
quite a while since I’ve truly gone all out in a fight.” A hint
of excitement had appeared in Xiangliu Fang’s eyes. Even he found
it quite taxing to help protect Youngflame Nong from so many combined
Dao-soldier attacks, as he had to block them all. Now that he no
longer needed to do so, he was suddenly much more free to utilize his
speed and agility, fighting to his heart’s content.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” With
but a thought, Youngflame Nong instantly caused the golden globe of
light to begin flying at high speed. With a swoosh, it quickly flew
towards the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
within the golden globe of light, curious, reached out to touch the
light. Previously, they had been able to easily pass through it, but
now, they realized that this golden globe of light felt extremely
tough and resilient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my
‘Goldspirit Halo’,” Youngflame Nong said confidently. “Once
I’ve activated the divine light within it, we are no longer able to
exit it, but outside attacks are similarly unable to reach us…forget
about these Dao-soldiers, even if three or five Loose Immortals came
and attacked, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to us until
after the energy of the divine light is used up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly sighed in
amazement. Unless something unexpected occurred, Youngflame Nong
would be the next Godplume Duke…and he really lived up to that
reputation. A casual treasure he pulled out was already comparable to
the two life-saving items which Ning had acquired from the underwater
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the two life-saving
items Ning had acquired in the underwater estate, one was offensive
while the other was defensive. The defensive one, he had acquired
from the Treasure Pavilion when he had reached the Wanxiang level as
a Fiendgod. The offensive one, he had acquired after passing the
fourth level of the Wargod Hall. This offensive treasure had been
personally forged by Daoist Threelives in a moment of amusement, and
its power was extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Skypillars!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look! Five
Skypillars!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldspirit Halo had
just flown a few hundred kilometers away, high into the skies. As the
saying went, when standing at a high vantage point, one would be able
to see to a greater distance. This Immortal estate was tens of
thousands of kilometers in size. Now that they were in the skies,
they could immediately see that at the ends of the world in each
direction, there was a pillar of golden light, soaring through the
clouds and into the heavens. There were five in total, and each was
unfathomably tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five golden
Skypillars of light seemed to be holding up the entire Immortal
estate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five directions…the
Five Elements,” Ning murmured to himself. “It seems this Immortal
estate is divided up into five branching halls, each of which help to
stabilize this world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skypillars.” Adept
Vastriver and the others all revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Youngflame Nong began to laugh loudly. “So this Witchriver Immortal
Estate is divided up into five halls. Those five distant Skypillars
represent the locations of the five halls. Let’s immediately go
over there. I have the key to the estate, and we can enter the halls.
Those monstrous Dao-soldiers, however, cannot. Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden globe of
light quickly flew towards one of the closest Skypillars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thundering roars of
battle seemed to shake the world. That vast, heaven-covering wave
came crashing towards them, but in front of that Goldspirit Halo, a
single, seemingly ordinary figure stood there protectively. It was
that servant…Xiangliu Fang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
rest of you can head over. I’ll be there soon,” Xiangliu Fang
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Goldspirit
Halo, Ji Ning and the others were naturally staring towards the
distant figure of Xiangliu Fang, as well as that heaven-covering
wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s body
suddenly increased explosively in size. An unearthly, savage aura
blasted out from him, and his figure quickly transformed into an
incomparably massive, terrifying, and towering shape that was more
than three thousand meters tall. His lower body was that of an
enormous serpent, while his upper body appeared to be human. From his
head, however, eight additional, massive serpentine heads emerged as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine heads, and the
body of a serpent. An ancient, primal, savage aura emanated from him,
filling the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgod!” Ning
held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…a
Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
completely overwhelmed. They could all tell that this was definitely
a Fiendgod! Someone with a strange appearance like this, with nine
heads and the body of a serpent, clearly was not a human…and yet,
he didn’t have the slightest hint of a monstrous aura either. What
he emanated was the aura of a primordial Fiendgod, which caused all
of their hearts to quiver. Given his massive body and ancient aura…he
could only be a Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of Xue Hongyi
and Adept Bu You had never before seen a true Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
body…is that a divine ability, or is his body naturally that
large?” Adept Bu You couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgods are born
with massive bodies,” Youngflame Nong said confidently. “Uncle
Fang belongs to the primordial Fiendgod race known as the Xiangliu,
the Hydraga. Hydraga, even amongst Fiendgods, are extremely powerful.
Even without using any divine abilities, they have Fiendgod bodies
that are three thousand meters long. Although Uncle Fang is only at
the Primal level, as a true Fiendgod, and a Hydraga at that, even
many Loose Immortals are no match for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all completely stunned. Although previously, Ning had seen an
ancient Fiendgod attack during in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains, and that ancient, awakened Fiendgod was clearly even more
powerful than Xiangliu Fang…that ancient Fiendgod had simply
crushed the Dragonwhale King’s with his fingers. Ning hadn’t had
a chance to watch him truly fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this time…he
finally had a chance to see a true Fiendgod fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgod Body
Refining…the goal was for humans to approach Fiendgods in terms of
body strength! However, compared to a true Fiendgod, there was still
a huge difference; for example, one’s body wouldn’t be as large
as a Fiendgod’s, and one’s innate talents wouldn’t be as strong
as a Fiendgod’s…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod?” The
monstrous Dao-soldiers that were attacking were all badly startled as
well. They had been living in this Immortal estate the entire time;
they had heard of Fiendgods, but this was their first time actually
seeing one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous,
nine-headed, serpent-bodied Fiendgod towered there in the skies, two
enormous black awls appearing within his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Xiangliu
Fang bellowed loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s
enormous serpentine tail swept out, and the air itself seemed to
explode. Xiangliu Fang threw himself directly towards the giant group
of monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a single
Fiendgod, and one that hasn’t even reached the Void level. No need
to fear him.” That massive, sonorous voice echoed out once more,
ringing in the ears of each of the monstrous Dao-soldiers. “Crush
this Fiendgod to death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaaaaargh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaaaaargh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaaaaargh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fnag’s eight
serpentine heads simultaneously unleashed savage roars. Suddenly, the
temperature in the surrounding area dropped precipitously, to the
point where ice and frost began to form. Instantly, a world of frost
and snow manifested. In addition, his roars also struck out against
their souls. However, since the monstrous Dao-soldiers were joined
together as one, their souls were joined together as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The massive
tidal wave crushed forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-thousand
meter Fiendgod moved straight forward to receive the attack, and the
long awls in his hands stabbed out viciously towards the massive
wave, causing the air to expode and seeming to carry enough power to
shatter the skies and rend the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiang Liufang’s
massive serpentine tail oscillated repeatedly, causing him to be
incomparably agile and crafty, allowing him to time and time again
avoid the sharp ‘tip’ of the massive wave, and then give the
massive wave a vicious counter-stab!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There, in the skies,
the Fiendgod and the massive wave collided against each other
repeatedly. A true Fiendgod absolutely had the power to fight those
at a higher level of power. A Primal Fiendgod…this was something
that was generally comparable to a powerful Loose Immortal or Earth
Immortal. As for a Void-level Fiendgod? They were all comparable to
Celestial Immortals! By comparison, Void-level human Earth Immortals,
even those who trained as Fiendgods, however, were vastly inferior to
Celestial Immortals. From this, one could tell how unique Fiendgods
were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
simply far too many of the monstrous Dao-soldiers. Even Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals would have to stay away from them.
Thus, the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, was still the weaker party in this
engagement. However, given his massive, Fiendgod body, he wasn’t
afraid of suffering wounds. He was also incomparably nimble, and was
thus able to unleash one terrifying attack after another in response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang can both
advance or retreat in this battle, and he’s extremely nimble. He’s
also able to keep fighting for a very long time…although these
monstrous Dao-soldiers are capable of unleashing a shocking amount of
power, there is a limit to their elemental ki; they won’t be able
to hold on for too long,” Youngflame Nong said confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.” Adept
Vastriver couldn’t help but sigh in amazement. “A true
Fiendgod…they truly are formidable. Fiendgod Body Refiners…no
matter how hard they strive to approach Fiendgods in power, a gulf
still remains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
truly is one of the top ten ancient clans of the Grand Xia Empire. A
single young master’s personal servant…is actually an ancient,
Primal-level Fiendgod.” Ning secretly sighed in amazement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long will it be
before my Dongyan clan is this powerful as well?” Ninelotus
murmured silently to herself. Although the Dongyan clan also had
Fiendgods, they wouldn’t go so far as to let one of their
Primal-level Fiendgods serve as personal bodyguards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei just watched all
of this quietly. As she looked at the Hydraga, some images from her
past life began to flit through her mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hydraga…” Yu Wei
let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s group was
fleeing towards the Skypillar while watching the battle, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Poison-Dragon,
hahaha…this Fiendgod is clearly only at the Primal level, but you
still aren’t able to do anything to him? You, a Loose Immortal?
Hahaha, it seems as though in the end, it will still be left to our
Witchriver clan.” Accompanied by a laugh that seemed to cause the
world to tremble, off in the distance, an enormous, ugly, hunchbacked
giant suddenly appeared. The hunchbacked giant was tens of thousands
of meters tall, and wielded a massive metal pitchfork. This giant
appeared rather blurry and indistinct; clearly, it was formed from a
large number of monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yaksha Dao-soldiers?
Immortal Witchriver actually had Yaksha Dao-soldiers under his
command?” Youngflame Nong was shocked. “The Witchriver clan…can
these be the descendants of Immortal Witchriver?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchriver was
originally a monster himself. Naturally, he treated his own clansmen
with more favor. Although countless years had passed, the clansmen of
Immortal Witchriver remained the most powerful monstrous force within
this Immortal estate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, quick,
retreat.” Youngflame Nong didn’t dare to hesitate, staring with
panic towards the distant Skypillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The Goldspirit Halo continued to move closer and closer towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense it.”
Youngflame Nong revealed a look of delight as he stared towards the
massive yet blurry illusion of a Skypillar, then loudly shouted,
“OPEN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, an enormous
entrance appeared into the illusory Skypillar. The entrance was open,
and upon seeing it, Ning and the others all revealed looks of
delight, knowing that this was one of the true, important locations
of the Witchriver Immortal Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldspirit Halo
flew directly inside, and then the illusory entrance once more
vanished.
</P>

Chapter 7 - The Vault of Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an enormous
palace, but it was completely quiet and soundless. The stillness here
had remained unbroken for countless, countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Youngflame Nong,
Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Xue Hongyi, and the others flew into the palace
from within the Goldspirit Halo, all of them let out sighs of relief.
They had finally managed to escape and make it inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We finally made it
in. That Immortal estate world is simply too terrifying. One group of
monstrous Dao-soldiers after another…one feels terrified just
looking at them.” Although Ning was no coward, he had felt
completely powerless earlier, because the difference in power was
simply too great. He would have been completely unable to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ning looked
back towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think…we
shouldn’t have come here?” Northson muttered, “Earlier, the
very first group of merfolk Dao-soldiers we fought against numbered
over a thousand. They were able to effortlessly crush us. And then,
afterwards, an even more powerful army of more than ten thousand
Dao-soldiers appeared…and then the so-called Yaksha Dao-soldier
appeared, formed from the monsters of the Witchriver clan. Even that
Fiendgod Hydraga was unable to stop them. I feel as though…we are
completely useless here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was muttering,
not sending a mental message. Thus, everyone around him could hear
his words. All of them were silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. Just now,
they had relied on Youngflame Nong’s servant, the Fiendgod,
Xiangliu Fang, to do everything. It was the Fiendgod who had killed
the leader of the merfolk Dao-soldiers, and it was also the Fiendgod
who had gone to block the ten-thousand plus Dao-soldier wave. Ning
and the others had only been able to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone,”
Youngflame Nong laughed, “Don’t feel dispirited. There was no way
that we could’ve predicted in advance that this Immortal estate
woud actually give birth to so many powerful monsters, all of whom
possessed Dao-armors. No matter what, however, in the end, we’ve
managed to make it inside one of the palaces of the Witchriver
Immortal Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only one who has the
key to the estate can make it inside; thus, after Immortal Witchriver
died, despite the passage of countless years, no other living
creatures have ever made it inside this palace. This is an extremely
safe place. But of course…some of the safeguards Immortal
Witchriver had originally set up might still be functioning. Thus,
let’s not rush about rashly. Wait for me to welcome Uncle Fang
inside, and then we’ll slowly search through this palace.”
Youngflame Nong’s words caused everyone to grow calm once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, given
that Immortal Witchriver had died more than a hundred million years
ago, there were definitely no living creatures within this palace.
Thus, it was certainly safer in here than it was outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Northson
immediately plopped down, seating himself cross-legged, then staring
around and calling out, “Senior apprentice-brother, senior
apprentice-sister, let’s all sit down and take a break.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then sat
down in the lotus position as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That scared me to
death.” Little Qing reared her serpentine head, blinking
repeatedly. The Whitewater Hound also lay down on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Adept
Vastriver, Xue Hongyi, Adept Bu You, and the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn
all either sat down or remained standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought from
Youngflame Nong…whoosh. In the air in front of them, a fist-sized
tunnel appeared. Through the void-tunnel, one could see the outside
world, where many monstrous Dao-soldiers were currently fighting
against a towering Hydraga Fiendgod!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang!”
Youngflame Nong was somewhat worried as well as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, if that
Fiendgod dies outside, we are in big trouble,” Little Qing sent
mentally to Ji Ning. “We’d be trapped inside this palace, unable
to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t jinx us!
Hydraga Fiendgods aren’t so easily killed. What’s more…how
could the exalted heir to the position of Godplume Duke of the
Youngflame clan just be trapped here?” Ning was still quite calm.
Even if the heavens were to collapse upon them, they had a ‘big
fellow’ ready to prop it back up. This was a trial which the
ancient, vast Youngflame clan had prepared for Youngflame Nong.
Perhaps Youngflame Nong might fail the test, but it wasn’t too
likely that he would simply be trapped here forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group remained
there, within the palace. They knew that this palace was extremely
large, and that there were many places within it, but they didn’t
dare to barge about wildly. Who knew which safeguards and protective
measures left behind by Immortal Witchriver were still active? If
they were unlucky and ran into a particularly powerful defensive
mechanism…a large number of them might die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Better to wait. Wait to
reunite with the Hydraga Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s group
quietly waited. Deep within a corridor, in a hidden passageway within
the heart of this vast palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This passageway was
filled with countless, towering statues. At a glance, one would see
eighteen grayish-black status, each of which were in the shape of a
legendary Godbeast, the Qiongqi Manticore. They coiled there within
the corridor. Countless years had passed in stillness, but as Ning’s
group had entered the quiet, silent, ancient palace…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Something seemed to
have been activated. The eighteen Qiongqi Manticore statues all began
to glow with golden light, a light which constantly flooded into the
statues and made them slowly appear more and more real.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snap.” The eyes of
one of the Qiongqi Manticores suddenly opened. A pair of jade-green,
glowing eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snap.” “Snap.”
“Snap.” “Snap.” “Snap.” “Snap.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Qiongqi Manticore
after another opened their eyes. Their eyes were filled with nothing
but coldness. They all rose to their feet, and even began to spread
their wings. They had a body as thick as an ox’s, but were covered
with bristling spikes. They also had a pair of giant wings, but the
head of a tiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the most
loyal, devoted guards of this palace…the eighteen Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems were not living
creatures, and thus they were truly ageless. Immortal Witchriver’s
servants and subordinates had all died of old age, but these golems
remained here, standing guard despite the passage of ages, continuing
to obey Immortal Witchriver’s order for them to guard this palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsiders have
entered the Vault of Treasures,” one of the Qiongqi golems rumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not Master’s heir
either. These outsiders forced their way in through using the key to
the estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some particularly
powerful golems possessed sentience and intelligence. For example,
when Ning had faced the initial trials of the underwater estate, he
had encountered that black-furred golem at the third challenge. That
golem had actually been filled with an actual spirit, and thus it was
even more intelligence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Neither Master, nor
Master’s heirs…all invaders must die.” one of the Qiongqi
Manticore golems said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Must die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Must die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Qiongqi
golems spoke out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To truly master the
Witchriver Immortal Estate, there were two methods. The first was to
possess the key to the estate and then have Immortal Witchriver
bestow a transmission incantation. Naturally, in that situation, all
of the formations, restrictive spells, and golems would be obedient.
The second method was to possess the key to the estate, then find and
bind the five cores within the five palaces. After completely binding
all five palace cores, then the entire Immortal estate would be
bound; this, too, would be complete control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
trial was to completely control this Immortal estate! But of course,
right now, Youngflame Nong was not yet the master of it…which was
why the Immortal estate was beginning its counterattacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outermost part of
the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through his
void-tunnel, Youngflame Nong was viewing the massive battle going on
in the outside part of the Immortal estate. The Hydraga Fiendgod was
roaring with rage as blood splattered everywhere; he fought while
retreating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster, faster,
faster.” Youngflame Nong was extremely worried. Ning, Northson, Yu
Wei, and the others were all standing behind him, watching the battle
through the void-tunnel as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the strength
which the Hydraga Fiendgod has demonstrated, I imagine it will be
quite hard for him to make it back here. That Yaksha Dao-soldier
formation is simply too powerful,” Yu Wei sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s being
attacked by two parties right now; one is the massive wave formed
from more than ten thousand Dao-soldiers, while the other is the even
more powerful Yaksha Dao-soldier formation. Both are more powerful
than him…” Adept Vastriver was frowning as he watched as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sent
mentally, “Given that this Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, was assigned to
protect Youngflame Nong, he is definitely carrying some treasures.
He’s only using those two long awls to battle right now; he hasn’t
used any other treasures at all. I imagine that he isn’t in any
real danger yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their group continued
to watch the battle through the void-tunnel, while the ten Wanxiang
Deathsworn continued to maintain a vigilant watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning’s face suddenly changed dramatically, as the space in the
surrounding area began to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, they were
in a hall, but suddenly, their group became trapped in a misty,
blurry illusory world. It became extremely hard for them to tell
north from south, east from west…they couldn’t even tell up from
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Youngflame Nong’s face changed as well, and the void-tunnel that
had been in front of him disappeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A restrictive
formation!” Adept Vastriver hurriedly sent mentally, “This palace
has a restrictive spell formation which was left behind by Immortal
Witchriver. Just now, the restrictive spell formation became
activated, and the spell formation covered that hall that we were in
just now. Although we are still within the hall, we’ve already
become trapped by the formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The surrounding
space has been locked and distorted. Even though I have the key to
the Immortal estate, I’m not able to open a tunnel to the outside
world either,” Youngflame Nong sent frantically. “Rainbowflame
Fairy, Adept Vastriver, Ji Ning…if I’m unable to open a corridor
to the outside world, there’s no way for Uncle Fang to come in.
It’s up to us now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
felt their hearts sink. Right. If they were unable to open a corridor
to the outside world, then there would be no way for the Fiendgod,
Xiangliu Fang, to enter. They had lost their strongest ally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning had a
sudden thought. He immediately released his divine sense…but he
sensed nothing but a blur. The power of the surrounding restrictive
spell had already completely smothered Ning’s divine sense. He
couldn’t even sense Mu Northson and the others who were right next
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have one more bit
of news to tell you all. In this formation…divine sense is of no
use,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Adept
Vastriver and the others were shocked. They gave it a try as well,
and as they did, their faces changed. “Even divine sense is unable
to see through this formation…then this means that this is
definitely no ordinary formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group began to
unconsciously move closer to each other. As for the ten Wanxiang
Deathsworn, they immediately joined together into a formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there anyone here
skilled in breaking formations? Hurry up and break it,” Youngflame
Nong sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White?” Ning
sent to the nearby Whitewater Hound. In recent years, he had spent
almost all of his energy on the Dao of formations, and he was
definitely superior to Ning in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a very
terrifying formation.” The Whitewater Hound shook his head,
continuing to analye it. But right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Out of nowhere, a throng of icy arrows suddenly
shot out, each containing awe-inspiring power as they sprang towards
Ning’s group, trapped within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were too close,
and they were too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BOOM.” A
Waterflame Lotus appeared around Ning, but upon being struck by three
attacking arrows, it instantly began to shatter and collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” Ning’s
face completely changed. These arrows were simply far too powerful;
just three arrows contained power great enough to shatter his lotus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now had a
premonition. With their group of Wanxiang Adepts being trapped within
this terrifying restrictive formation, most likely, a number of them
would truly perish.

Chapter 8 - Casualties
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single ice shard
is capable of killing an ordinary peak Wanxiang Adept.” Adept
Vastriver immediately sent urgently, “Everyone, quick, assemble
into formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble into
formation; a five-elements pentagonal formation,” Ji Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is too
terrifying,” Mu Northson said loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…Ning,
Northson, Yu Wei, Ninelotus, and Adept Vastriver were of the same
school; naturally, they instinctively elected to use a five-elements
pentagonal formation of the Black-White College. Combination
formations did not need to be purchased with black-white pellets; on
the contrary, the disciples of the school were required to learn
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their five figures
began to move, and instantly, their bodies began to glow with light.
Metallic light, red light, watery blue light, yellow light, and azure
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Once
their formation was joined, Ning calmed down slightly. “The power
of these ice shards is too astonishing; when I fought against Daoist
Snowplume, he sent out those drops of skywater against me…but
although they were capable of damaging my Waterflame Lotus, they
weren’t able to break through it. Those three ice shards, however,
were able to break my Waterflame Lotus. This means every single shard
contained power comparable to a drop of skywater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume had
only used, in total, 108 drops of skywater…in contrast, these ice
shards came in a tightly clustered, endlessly streaming series of
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, even a
Primal Daoist would be killed by this cluster attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the five of
you, stand in front of me,” Youngflame Nong barked mentally. “The
other ten of you, stay behind me. Xue Hongyi, Adept Bu You, stay to
my sides.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
was the strongest; after all, three of them were somewhat stronger
than ordinary Primal Daoists. After joining forces…they would be
the most powerful force present. Naturally, they would have to block
in front of Youngflame Nong and help screen him from the ambushing
arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the ten Wanxiang
Deathsworn, although they were somewhat weak, there was still ten of
them; when in formation, they were also quite powerful, and thus they
could help Youngflame Nongn block ice shards from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining gaps
would naturally be filled and covered by Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu You.
The two of them both joined together into the most common of
formations, the ‘Liangyi Duality Formation’. This formation was
one which virtually all Immortal cultivators were capable of, but in
turn, it wasn’t very effective; there was a limit to how much it
could raise one’s power. Still, it was still able to increase one’s
power slightly, and so the two would naturally execute it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
trouble,” Xue Hongyi cursed secretly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
very dangerous.” Adept Bu You grew frantic as well; the two of them
were weaker than Ji Ning to begin with. Ning was now in a five-man
formation, while they were only in a two-man formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that these ice shards were capable of easily killing Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu
You were in an extremely dangerous situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, we’re almost unable to hold on,” Xue Hongyi sent
frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m unable to hold
on for much longer as well,” Adept Bu You was similarly frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How useless,”
Youngflame Nong cursed mentally. He was frantic too. “In the end,
it’s still those five from the Black-White College who are
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold for as long as
you can…the longer you can hold, the better our chances,”
Youngflame Nong sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver sent
hurriedly back, “Young master Youngflame, this formation must have
been left behind by Immortal Witchriver. If Immortal Witchriver was
present and personally controlling it, this formation would perhaps
be even more powerful, capable of causing even Loose Immortals or
Earth Immortals to perish. Now that he’s gone, the power of it has
been lessened a bit, but we won’t be able to resist it for too
long. There is a limit to how much elemental ki we have, but the
formation utilizes the elemental energy of the natural world…it can
persist indefinitely! It can exhaust us to death. The most important
thing for us to do right now is to have a formations expert locate a
flaw in this formation and break it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When trapped within a
formation, if a true formations expert was present, he could guide
the party through and out from the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a somewhat weaker
formations expert was presence, he could work hard to find some flaws
and weaknesses in the formation, then use their most powerful attacks
against their weak points. In a situation like that, the chances of
victory would naturally be greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if one was too weak
in terms of formations…then one would remain trapped within the
formation, subject to being trampled upon and incapable of doing
anything but using brute force to try and resist. This was the worst
case scenario.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, you must have brought a formations expert with you in
your investigation of this Immortal estate,” Northson sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong gritted
his teeth. A formations expert? Of course he had brought one! But his
formations expert was in the outside world of the Immortal estate! It
was the Fiendgod - Xiangliu Fang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgods were born
from the natural world. The Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang had been born
during the Fiendgod Era, and he had survived from then until now;
from this, one could imagine how long a life he had lived. However,
Fiendgods were different from other races; Fiendgods were truly the
favored children of the heavens, the beloved scions of the universe.
They were born with the innate ability to train and with innate
divine abilities. In fact, some Primordial Fiendgods were even born
with mastery over a Dao Path, or even an entire Grand Dao Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Fiendgods did not
need to suffer the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations! Their
lives were infinite and unlimited! However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their training speed,
in turn, was incomparably slow. In fact, upon reaching a certain
level, they would be unable to improve any further! For example, this
Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, had reached the Primal level countless
hundreds of millions of years ago, but he remained at the Primal
level. Most likely, his potential had been exhausted, and in the
future, he would forever remain a Primal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, their
extremely long lives led them to begin to analyze and train in other
areas, such as the Dao of Constructs or formations, which required a
tremendous amount of time to research. Thus, although he was a bit
weaker in terms of his comprehensive abilities, due to his extremely
long life, Xiangliu Fang was a true formations master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per their original
plan, Xiangliu Fang was to stay right next to Youngflame Nong and
protect him. They shouldn’t have been separated at all! But
earlier…when faced with attacks from so many monstrous
Dao-soldiers, someone had to go delay them. Thus, Xiangliu Fang had
been separated from the group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang!”
Youngflame Nong was both frantic and filled with regret. “If I had
known this would happen, I wouldn’t have left Uncle Fang leave me.
After we overcome this tribulation and once he returns, I won’t let
him leave me again. Absolutely not!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang is
skilled in formations,” Youngflame Nong sent back hurriedly, “But
he’s completely unable to come inside. Everyone…are any of you
skilled in formations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What kind of a sick
joke is this?!” Northson was both angry and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendgod is
skilled in formations?” Ning and the others were all speechless.
The one who was skilled in formations was trapped outside, unable to
enter the palace. As for the rest of them, who amongst them was
skilled in formations? Although they were all true geniuses, they had
all spent all of their energy on their own Daos; even Ji Ning, who
was talented in terms of formations, he still primarily spent his
time and energy on the Dao of the Sword. He would only occasionally
flip through formation scrolls to relieve boredom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Vastriver,
Rainbowflame Fairy, the two of you are both reincarnated Immortals.
In your past lives, I imagine that you must have researched
formations before. Can you remember anything about them?”
Youngflame Nong sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are only at the
Wanxiang level; we occasionally gain just a few fragments of our
memories. The Dao of Formations is an extremely vast and broad one;
only after completely awakening our former memories will we be able
to master our previous insights regarding formations,” Adept
Vastriver sent back helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong, Ji
Ning, and the others were chatting mentally at an extremely high
speed. However, these arrows of ice that were being created and shot
out by the formation were also moving at extremely high speed. The
two weakest spots in the protective array, Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu
You, were even beginning to suffer wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, we aren’t able to hold,” Xue Hongyi said, left arm
stained red with blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t hold.”
Adept Bu You sent hurriedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and come
in.” Youngflame Nong had no choice but to give this order. “Ji
Ning, Adept Vastriver…the five of you, you’ll have to cover the
locations which Xue Hongyi and Bu You were previously covering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group had no
choice but to grind their teeth and expand the scope of their
formation to cover a wider range. But in doing so, the number of ice
shard attacks they suffered increased as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were almost
finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon entering the
center, Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu You couldn’t help but let out sighs
of relief. They hurriedly swallowed spirit-pills, replenishing their
power and healing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do?” Youngflame Nong began to ponder frantically.
Although he had quite a few protective treasures on him, there was no
way for him to break through this ancient, giant formation which a
Celestial Immortal had set down. But of course, he could give up on
this trial and use a ‘greater teleportation’ to immediately
leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon doing so…that
meant that he would have failed his trial. Youngflame Nong absolutely
would not permit this to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to break this
formation, but how? For now, those five disciples of the Black-White
College and those ten Wanxiang Deathsworn are able to hold on, but as
time goes on, their elemental ki will begin to deplete, at which
point, death will be the result.” Youngflame Nong was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the chaotic void
of the formation, an enormous, grayish-black, winged, ox-bodied,
spiked, tiger-headed golem appeared. It was a Qiongqi Manticore
golem! This Qiongqi Manticore suddenly appeared within the formation,
and then, with a flutter of its wings, swooped out in an arc,
avoiding the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn and clawing towards young master
Youngflame at the center.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect young master
Youngflame,” Xue Hongyi immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Qiongqi Manticore
golem after another came howling forth. In almost a single instant,
eighteen of them appeared in the surrounding area. For the moment, Ji
Ning and the others were all being held down by these other Qiongqi
Manticore golems, and were completely unable to protect young master
Youngflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword struck out like
a gleam of moonlight, chopping against the head of one of the Qiongqi
golems. The Qiongqi golem was knocked backwards by thirty meters,
came to halt, then threw itself forward once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was surrounded
by seven hundred-plus flying swords. Seeing the situation, his face
changed. Right now, the five of them were in a formation, and so his
own elemental ki naturally had strengthed significantly…and yet,
despite using the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], he was still only able to knock the Qiongqi golem back a
short distance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Qiongqi golems
all have the combat capability of a Primal Daoist, and their bodies
are nigh impenetrable, as hard as magic treasures. They are far more
difficult to deal with than ordinary Primal Daoists.” Northson was
a genius of the Dao of Constructs; upon seeing these Qiongqi golems,
he immediately knew that they were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place actually
has golems that are as powerful as Primal Daoists…every single one
of them is incomparably precious, and there are a total of eighteen
of them here!” Ning struck out with one flash of sword light after
another, only just barely managing to tie down two of the Qiongqi
Manticore golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems with the power
of Primal Daoists would generally cause even Loose Immortals
headaches. However, for a Celestial Immortal…purchasing eighteen
golems on this level was still fairly easily done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen Qiongqi
golems. Ten of them were able to completely tie down Ji Ning’s
group of five, as well as the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn. As for the
other eight, they charged straight towards Youngflame Nong in the
center of the array. These Qiongqi golems were sentient; they knew
that Youngflame Nong was the ‘bandit chief’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By Youngflame Nong’s
side was Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu You. They naturally were caught in
the crossfire as well. When these eight Qiongqi golems attacked, both
Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu You began to panic. This was because every
single Qiongqi golem was at least as strong as them. In addition,
their ‘bodies’ were actually magic treasures, and thus were
unbreakably tough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Riiiiip!” A sharp
claw flashed out lightning-fast, slashing past Adept Bu You’s body,
tearing him apart and sending blood flying everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Adept Bu
You’s eyes were completely round. He had thought that by coming, he
would gain young master Youngflame’s favor…but in the end, he had
lost his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first Wanxiang
Adept death in their group had finally occurred.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Heavy Casualties
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Bu You’s death
provoked Youngflame Nong, Ji Ning, and the others. The most provoked
of all, of course, Xue Hongyi, whose strength was essentially on par
with Adept Bu You.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shouldn’t have
come here. I shouldn’t have come here!” Xue Hongyi’s eyes were
completely red. A Dao-seal appeared in his hand, and it instantly
transformed into a barrier of light that covered his body. Boom! It
managed to forcibly endure a claw strike from a Qiongqi Manticore
Golem. The golden light around his body trembled, but Xue Hongyi
seized this chance to quickly escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He fled far away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten of the eighteen
Qiongqi golems were tied down by Ji Ning’s group of five and the
ten Wanxiang Deathsworn. As for the other eight, they focused on
young master Youngflame. Xue Hongyi, going all out, managed to escape
from the center of their array, and for a moment, there were no
Qiongqi golems after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, damn.”
Youngflame Nong gave a cold sideways glance to the distant Xue
Hongyi. Earlier, Xue Hongyi and Adept Bu You had been at least able
to tie down three of the Qiongqi Manticore golems, but now with Adept
Bu You slain and Xue Hongyi fled…the eight golems were completely
surrounding and focusing on Youngflame Nong himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pitiable look
appeared on Xue Hongyi’s face, and he frantically sent mentally,
“Young master Youngflame, I’m truly unable to stop them. Brother
Bu You has already died; even if I were to resist, in just a few
breaths, I would lose my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
was extremely angry, but he knew that these people weren’t his
slaves, nor were they Deathsworn; in the face of certain death, it
was normal for them to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, damn, damn! If
I can reunite with Uncle Fang…within this Witchriver Immortal
Estate, I’m never going to let him leave my side again, ever!”
Youngflame Nong truly felt regret for having allowed Xiangliu Fang to
depart. If he had known that this would be the result, he would’ve
simply used two of his treasures to lock down the two groups of
monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Treasures capable of
blocking more than ten thousand linked Dao-soldiers were naturally
extraordinary, and young master Youngflame hadn’t been willing to
use them up. But now, it was too late for regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
stood there, a crimson red salamander coiling around him. The crimson
salamander was emanating a terrifying aura, and it repeatedly slashed
its claws against the attacking Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! One
golem after another was sent flying back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long tail of the
Redscale Salamander slapped out repeatedly as well, but the ‘body’
of the Qiongqi golems was composed of magic treasures; they were
unbreakable. Thus, they didn’t fear being struck, and they wildly
surrounded and attacked Youngflame Nong. The sharp claws of the
Qiongqi golems left enormous, gaping wounds on the body of the
Rescale Salamander as well, tearing its scales open and sending blood
spraying everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Redscale
Salamander was able to heal its wounds at an astonishing rate, and it
continued to go all out in its battle against these Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This single Godbeast,
the Redscale Salamander, was blocking eight Qiongqi Manticore golems!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
Redscale Salamander.” Although Ning was fighting, he was also
keeping an eye on the overall situation. The power of the Redscale
Salamander made him sigh in amazement. “It lives up to its
reputation as possessing one of the most exalted Godbeast lineages.
In addition, it should also have trained in Fiendgod Body Refining;
although it is only at the Wanxiang level, it already has combat
prowess comparable to a peak Primal. Even if I were to unleash all my
power, I would probably only be on par with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
utilizing his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Although he was
being supported by the five-elements pentagonal formation, the power
of it was still a bit weaker than his close combat prowess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clank.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clank.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
working extremely hard to block the Qiongqi golems. From the side,
those icy shards continued to fill the air and shoot towards them at
high speed as well. However, the Qiongqi golems were also
accidentally struck by and injured by the ice shards; after all, they
were only capable of activating the formation, not controlling it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the master of the
Immortal estate and the heir to Immortal estate were able to truly
control the formation. Without a controller, the icy shards were
unable to differentiate between friend or foe. However, since the
Qiongqi golems had treasure-like bodies, they didn’t care about the
attacks from the icy shards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning’s
face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is trouble.”
Adept Vastriver was shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had been
keeping an eye on the overall flow of battle. Those eight Qiongqi
golems that previously had been surrounding and attacking young
master Youngflame, due to being constantly blocked by the Godbeast,
‘Redscale Salamander’, actually gave up attacking him and instead
immediately threw themselves towards the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparatively speaking,
the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn were a bit weaker. However, their wills
were joined, and after having entered the grand formation, they were
capable of tying down three of the Qiongqi Manticore golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, when eight
more of the golems suddenly charged towards them, this meant that the
number of golems they were facing instantly reached eleven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the eleven golems
were attacking Ning’s group of five, the five of them would’ve
been able to hold on, but they were attacking the ten Wanxiang
Deathsworn instead…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HALT!” Youngflame
Nong was enraged. Up till now, he had not personally intervened, but
at this moment, an enormous black whip suddenly appeared out of
nowhere into his hands. The black whip was covered with a flowing
layer of black firelight. He snapped the whip out powerfully, and it
lashed through the air, striking towards the Qiongqi golems in the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long whip struck
one of the Qiongqi golems, and immediately knocked it backwards,
sending flying all the way out of the formation, causing it to
disappear from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! Young
master Youngflame lashed his whip out repeatedly, each strike
carrying inconceivable power and sending each stricken Qiongqi
Manticore golem flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all shocked. None of them had imagined that this young master
Youngflame was so powerful. In fact, at a single glance, Ning was
able to tell for certain that the fire covering the whip which young
master Youngflame was using was actually ‘earthfire’. And, unless
he was mistaken, it was earthfire that should have reached the first
grade, which was why it was comparable to ordinary skyfire in might!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His flames are
formed from first-grade earthfire. That whip is strange as well. In
addition, young master Youngflame’s aura suddenly exploded with
might; it must be some secret technique.” Ning sighed mentally at
what he had seen. This ancient, massive Youngflame clan clearly had
made multifaceted preparations for the upbringing of their next clan
leader. His combat power, at the very least, was amazing. The man was
definitely at the same level as Ning himself and Yu Wei, and his
treasures were even more powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” A look of
utmost anger appeared on Youngflame Nong’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his whip had
sent three Qiongqi golems flying in sequence, Youngflame Nong was,
after all, just a single person…and there were eleven golems
attacking. Thus, the other eight Qiongqi golems, accompanied by a
large number of icy shards, continued to tear into and through the
formation of the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn, ripping one of them into
tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The death of one caused
the strength of the other nine to immediately fall dramatically. And,
at this moment, those three Qiongqi Manticore golems that had been
sent flying out of the formation now came flying back inside. They
were completely undamaged, and they once more threw themselves
towards the nine Wanxiang Deathsworn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, we are
leaving now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RIP.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Wanxiang Adepts
did not fear death, but they were still torn apart, one by one, by
the Qiongqi golems. Some were torn apart, while others were flattened
to death by blows from the Qiongqi golems’ wings. In virtually just
a single breath’s worth of time, the ten Wanxiang Deathsworn had
all died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
was utterly enraged, but he didn’t dare to allow the Redscale
Salamander by his side to leave, because he himself was not an
Fiendgod Body Refiner. In close combat, he was at a huge
disadvantage, and so the Redscale Salamander had to stay next to him
to protect him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill those five.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleven Qiongqi
Manticore golems didn’t even look at Youngflame Nong; they threw
themselves directly towards the five disciples of the Black-White
College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning’s group had
seen how the Qiongqi golems had surrounded and killed those ten
Wanxiang Deathsworn, they knew that things had taken a turn for the
worse. However, they were being tied down by these other seven
golems…after all, of the five, the three most powerful were Ji
Ning, Yu Wei, and Adept Vastriver, with Ninelotus and Mu Northson
being comparatively weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
Rainbowflame Fairy, Adept Vastriver,” Young master Youngflame sent
frantically, “Be careful of those Qiongqi golems. You have to be
able to hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn these
detestable Qiongqi golems. Damn them! First, they killed my ten
Deathsworn, and now they are going to kill Ji Ning’s group.”
Young master Youngflame knew exactly what was going on. Ning’s
group was helping him tie down quite a few of the Qiongqi golems; if
they were to die, then all eighteen golems would encircle and attack
him. Although he had many magic treasures, his only choice would be
to use the greater teleportation seal and flee. But upon fleeing, he
would have failed this trial, and in the future, his chances of
becoming the next Godplume Duke would be lessened. He absolutely
would not permit this to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, let me in.
Xue Hongyi, get the f*ck over here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
and his Redscale Salamander, as well as the terrified Xue Hongyi,
flew directly into the five-person formation which Ning’s group had
set up. Ning’s group naturally did not prevent them from doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.” Young
master Youngflame, a sinister look on his face, gave the order, then
immediately began to brandish his long black whip, blazing with black
fire. As for the Redscale Salamander, it stretched half of its body
outside, sending its claws towards the Qiongqi golems in raking
attacks. Xue Hongyi also used all of his magic treasures, wanting to
make up for his earlier transgression of fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame,” Ning sent suddenly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Young
master Youngflame was in an extremely foul mood right now, but to one
of his main sources of support, Ji Ning, he still maintained an air
of courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spirit-beast
under my control, the Whitewater Hound, is exceedingly well-versed in
the Dao of Formations, and he has studied it for a long time. He’s
already discovered a flaw in the formation, and is confident in being
able to break it,” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
had been in an utterly furious mood, but upon hearing Ning’s words,
he couldn’t help but feel a hint of eagerness and disbelief. “Did
you just say that the spirit-beast you control, that Whitewater
Hound, is able to break this formation? This is a formation which
Immortal Witchriver set down. He is actually able to break a
formation set down by a Celestial Immortal? Are you sure he can do
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that he was
belittling the Whitewater Hound; rather, he didn’t believe the
Whitewater Hound could possibly be that gifted in formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, although this is a formation left behind by Immortal
Witchriver, he himself wasn’t necessarily skilled in formations. In
addition, although this formation is formidable, there isn’t anyone
currently controlling it. A formation which no one is controlling…is
extremely clumsy and not at all agile,” Ning sent hurriedly. “My
Whitewater Hound spirit-beast, by using the Fuxi Staff Formation, is
absolutely capable of breaking this formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi Staff
Formation? Fine, I’ll trust you. I have a set of top-grade Fuxi
Staff Formation treasures; use them, and the power of his formation
will definitely increase.” At a time like this, young master
Youngflame wouldn’t be stingy at all; he immediately took out a set
of top-grade Fuxi Staff Formation artifacts, then tossed them over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind Ning was the
Whitewater Hound, who had yet to fight and had spent this entire
period of time focusing on analyzing the formation. He sent a surge
of elemental ki out from his body, wrapping it around the completely
ownerless Fuxi Staff Formation artifacts and easily binding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, you
truly feel confident?” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, Ning,
my son. I’ve spent a long time analyzing this formation, and am
absolutely certain that I’ll be able to break it. This formation,
despite being incomparably powerful, has no one at the helm. You
should know that the more powerful a formation is, the more
complicated it is as well. The formation is only able to unleash such
power because it is drawing in the natural energy of the world, then
transforming it through repeated cycles; as long as we are able
‘choke’ a single part of the cycle, then the entire formation
will become useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this formation
had someone controlling it, then he naturally would be constantly
changing things. It would be extremely hard to break the formation.
But without a controller, it is hundreds and thousands of times
easier to break this formation,” the Whitewater Hound said. “And
with these unexpected top-grade Fuxi Staff Formation artifacts…well,
young master Youngflame really is quite generous.”

Chapter 10 - This is the Vault of Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because
you, Uncle White, are capable of breaking the formation,” Ji Ning
sent mentally. “Uncle White, we have no time to waste. Hurry up and
break it. If there’s anything you need, just speak out; young
master Youngflame will definitely provide it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep these Qiongqi
golems a bit farther away; make it so that within thirty meters, I
won’t be disturbed in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning immediately
sent mentally, “Young master Youngflame, everyone, we are going to
expand the scope of this five elements formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Expand it? The
larger we make the formation, the more ice shards will strike us,”
Adept Vastriver said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Whitewater Hound
spirit-beast is able to break this formation, but he needs thirty
meters of space to do so,” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break the
formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were both
delighted and shocked. Youngflame Nong urged frantically, “Everyone,
hurry up and do your best to hold on for a period of time.” After
finishing his words, he gave Xue Hongyi a hard look, and Xue Hongyi
hurriedly tried to make it appear as though he truly was going all
out and risking his life to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation expanded.
Youngflame Nong and his Redscale Salamander displayed their might as
well; the two of them, man and spirit-beast, were able to
simultaneously tie down eight of those Qiongqi Manticore golems,
while Xue Hongyi managed to block one as well. As for Ji Ning and the
rest of the five, they were able to block the other nine Qiongqi
golems. For a period of time, the group was actually able to
overpower the golems and deliver blows to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, while they
were overpowering the golems, they still had to divert part of their
attention and efforts to blocking the icy shards. Each of them were
using up astonishing amounts of elemental ki; they were all operating
at maximum power, a state which they couldn’t maintain for too
long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large, snowy white
hound was in the very center of the entire formation. Around him were
ancient, simple-looking wooden staffs that were covered with magic
runes. The staffs suddenly flew out in every direction, quickly
landing in various areas. As each staff landed down, the space around
them seemed to have been ‘nailed down’. All sixty four Fuxi
Staffs descended on their respective locations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single staff
suddenly began to glow with an eye-catching, watery glow. In
addition, lines of watery light began to connect between the staffs,
forming an incomparably massive seal-formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seal-formation
actually began to merge with the giant formation around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a drop of
black water, falling onto a spotless white cloth, or a iron spike
that was thrust into the spokes of a wheel; in short, the grand
formation which had previously been incomparably harmonious and
perfect was suddenly, instantly, ‘stuck’. In turn, the
incomparably powerful surges of elemental energy from the natural
world ceased to flow, and the attacking ice shards suddenly began to
weaken in power. In but a single breath’s worth of time, they all
vanished into nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the entire
grand formation itself completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient hall that
they had been in previously once more appeared within Ning’s field
of vision. They were still within the hall; they had never actually
left it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation is
broken?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong was
stunned for a moment, but then he was wildly overjoyed. When he had
been trapped within the formation, he had been consumed with the
agony of despair and bitterness. Now that he had been released from
it…it was hard for him to express the joy in his heart through
words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” Mu Northson blinked his eyes as he looked at the
large, snowy white dog in their midst.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
Whitewater Hound.” Adept Vastriver looked at the snowy white dog as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, you
really are formidable,” Ninelotus sent mentally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
absolutely overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Xue Hongyi was
surprised and delighted at their escape, in his heart, he still felt
extremely displeased. “Even his spirit-beast is as formidable as
this in formations…why the hell don’t I have such a powerful
spirit-beast? Damnable, absolutely damanable…this time, Ji Ning
once again became the one to accumulate great merits in front of
young master Youngflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No longer having to
worry about the constant attacks from the overwhelming number of icy
arrows, Ning and the others instantly exploded with power. By relying
on the five-elements pentagonal formation, Ning, Adept Vastriver, and
Yu Wei were each able to lock down four of the Qiongi golems, while
Ninelotus, Northson, and Xue Hongyi were each able to lock down one.
The Redscale Salamander, by itself, was able to block all of the
other golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was now extremely
easy. Young master Youngflame didn’t even need to personally
intervene; all eighteen of the golems were now locked down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, the
formation has been broken. You can come in now.” Youngflame Nong
sent a spiritual message to Xiangliu Fang, who was still outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had set up a
soul-bind long ago. Xiangliu Fang, this Fiendgod, was Youngflame
Nong’s most loyal servant; otherwise, how could the Youngflame clan
be comfortable with sending a Fiendgod to accompany their young
master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang had
successfully fled to the outside perimeter of this palace long ago,
but unfortunately, he wasn’t able to enter. Thus, he could only
continue to run about and flee outside of it. The entire Immortal
estate was only a few tens of thousands of kilometers in size; it
truly was too small. Xiangliu Fang had already completely
circumnavigated this world once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop chasing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Fiendgod is too
crafty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And he won’t die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two mightiest
monstrous powers in the Immortal estate world had both given up their
chase. Although their attacks on Xiangliu Fang had caused him
repeated injuries, as a Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang’s recuperative
abilities were simply too astonishing. In addition, he had been using
evasive techniques, causing his speed to vastly outstrip the combined
Dao-soldier armies. After repeated engagements, the two forces had
given up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Fiendgod isn’t
easy to deal with, but those humans that came in with him are far
weaker. This Fiendgod is a protector for one of them; once they come
out, we’ll kill the humans, then seize the key to the Immortal
estate.” These monstrous powers were also waiting outside the Vault
of Treasures, one of the five palaces of the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning’s
group came out, they would surround them and kill them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their one and
only chance at seizing the key to the Immortal estate. Leaving this
Immortal estate world was something which the various monstrous races
here had hoped and dreamed about for countless ages. Their ancestors
had all passed down legends of how incomparably vast the outside
world was, and how even Immortals could fly for days and nights
without reaching the ends of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Days and nights?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters of the
Immortal estate world couldn’t even imagine such a thing, because
in the Immortal estate world, a Loose Immortal could completely
circumnavigate the world in as much time as was needed to boil a
kettle of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly want to
leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly want to see
that vast, endless world.” All the monsters shared this feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, the
distant Xiangliu Fang was still awaiting Youngflame Nong’s
spirit-message; both of them had extremely powerful souls, and thus
they could naturally communicate spiritually at a fairly long
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master is
trapped within a formation in that palace…what should I do?”
Xiangliu Fang was worried as well. “I can’t go in. If no one can
break the formation and the young master remains trapped in it…in
the end, I’m afraid he’ll give up and leave, but if he does, that
means he will have failed this trial.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang was
worried, but he had no way of entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, the
formation is broken. You can come in now,” Youngflame Nong sent
spiritually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation is
broken?” Xiangliu Fang was amazed and delighted. He immediately
transformed into a streak of light and flew towards the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He flew over at high
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Fiendgod is
coming again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t kill
him…why’s he coming?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that he
wants to enter the palace? Let’s follow him and go in together.”
The monstrous Dao-soldiers reformed into that titanic wave and the
Yaksha Dao-soldier. They looked at the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, but
didn’t attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. In midair, an
enormous palace door suddenly appeared, and then the door swung open.
Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang had just reached that location. With a swoosh,
he flew through the palace door…and then, the illusory door once
more vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang and young
master Youngflame’s coordination was simply perfect. As soon as he
had arrived, the door had appeared, and as soon as he entered, the
palace door had once more shut, causing the pursuing Dao-soldiers
that were right behind him to be unable to enter at all. After all,
Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang was faster than them to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait! I refuse to
believe he won’t come out! As soon as they come out, we’ll first
kill those humans, then seize the key to the Immortal estate.” The
monstrous Dao-soldiers could only choose to wait patiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the massive
palace hall. Ning’s group was still fighting back against the
wildly attacking Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.” A figure
suddenly charged in. It was a pitch-black, narrow-eyed, middle-aged
man…the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang.”
Youngflame Nong was delighted. Finally, he had reunited with Uncle
Fang. After seeing Uncle Fang, his restless, uneasy heart finally
calmed down. With Uncle Fang present, he was safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon entering, Xiangliu
Fang immediately saw those Qiongqi Manticore golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golems?” Xiangliu
Fang, with a single step, arrived next to one of the Qiongqi golems.
The golem immediately bellowed, slashing out with his claws and
wanting to tear Xiangliu Fang apart. But what welcomed it was
Xiangliu Fang’s fist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fist smashed
directly upon the Qiongi golem, like the descent of a meteor,
knocking it flying back and, with a titanic smashing out, sending it
smashing hard against the walls of the palace. The walls of the
Immortal estate were incomparably sturdy, while the Qiongqi golem
itself was a magic artifact; neither were damaged. However, the
Qiongqi golem first slumped to the ground, before them clambering
back to its feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primal golem?”
Xiangliu Fang frowned, and then he threw out an enormous sack.
“Come.” Xiangliu Fang waved his large hands, and then his ten
fingers transformed into ten giant snakes, filling the air as they
seized two of the Qiongqi golems. The two Qiongqi golems struggled
viciously, but weren’t able to escape from Xiangliu Fang’s
snake-hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in.” After
having seized the two Qiongqi golems, Xiangliu Fang tossed them
directly into the sack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang moved as
fast as lightning, his giant hands filled with boundless,
awe-inspiring might. Clearly, this was a powerful divine ability he
had access to. With power far greater than that of the Qiongqi
golems, he snatched them two or three at a time. In the blink of an
eye, all eighteen of the golems had been seized and thrown into the
sack; they didn’t even have a chance to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So powerful.” Ning
and the others were stupefied and speechless with amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang.”
Youngflame Nong was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang nodded,
then gave a sideways glance to the Whitewater Hound, who was still
maintaining the formation. He said softly, “Whitewater Hound? There
are very few monsters who are skilled in formations. Whitewater
Hounds are indeed extremely intelligent and well-suited for analyzing
formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking,
Xiangliu Fang transformed into a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! He
flew to three places, smashing down viciously with his fist. Although
the palace itself was undamaged, some of its decorations, such as its
giant chandeliers and drapes, were smashed into tiny bits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ve
already blocked the critical chokepoints to the formation.”
Xiangliu Fang looked towards the Whitewater Hound. “No need for you
to constantly maintain the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
retrieved the artifacts from his Fuxi Staff Formation, and indeed,
the previously active enemy formation didn’t respond at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning and
the others shared glances, then revealed smiles. With an expert
present, things would indeed be much simpler going forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Xiangliu Fang
frowned slightly as he looked towards a distant place in the palace.
He pointed towards it, and instantly, a ray of black divine power
flew out from his finger, striking against the distant palace wall.
Three giant characters instantly appeared on the wall - VAULT OF
TREASURES.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Vault of
Treasures?” Ning, Northson, and Xue Hongyi were all overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal estate
world had a total of five palaces. Ning’s group had no idea what
the palace they had entered was meant for. Now, upon seeing those
three characters, they knew immediately that this must be for storing
treasures! Originally, Youngflame Nong had promised that any
treasures they were capable of acquiring from within the Immortal
estate would be theirs!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 11 - The Treasure Vault of a Celestial Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” Youngflame Nong could naturally tell what Ji Ning and
the others were thinking. Smiling, he said, “The treasures aren’t
going anywhere. As I said to you, and as I even promised in the name
of the Youngflame clan, anything you acquire will belong to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And these.”
Youngflame Nong pointed towards the ground nearby. On the ground were
the magic treasures left behind by Adept Bu You and the ten Wanxiang
Deathsworn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, we were
trapped within the Immortal estate’s formation; it was thanks to Ji
Ning’s spirit-beast that we were able to break through it. These
magic treasures aren’t worth that much; Ji Ning, go ahead and take
them.” Youngflame Nong looked towards Ning, who didn’t hesitate;
he immediately collected all of the various magic treasures. After
all, these were treasures from eleven Wanxiang Adepts, one of whom
was a two-clawed Raindragon Guard. This sort of treasure was quite
valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi looked at
Ning, musing secretly to himself, “Damn your luck! I want to see
how long it holds!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he felt
jealous hatred, he still understood that right now, the Black-White
College’s five disciples held the advantage in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Youngflame Nong now appeared much more relaxed. With Xiangliu Fang by
his side, he began to walk leisurely to the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the five
palaces were extremely large. However, Xiangliu Fang was a true
expert of formations; he led them with ease through the various
corridors, and they thus naturally made their way towards the heart
of the entire palace. Just a short while later, Ning’s group
arrived at an incomparably wide hall within the palace, filled with a
jade bed at the front and prayer mats below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade bed was most
likely where Immortal Witchriver used to sit and meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…!?”
Youngflame Nong suddenly stared at the jade bed. His Immortal estate
key was vibrating strongly, having sensed where the heart of this
palace was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That jade bed is the
core of this palace,” Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, let me
take a look.” Xiangliu Fang stretched his hands out. His hands
instantly expanded, and his ten fingers transformed into ten giant
snakes which filled the air and swarmed the region. After sweeping
past the region, he nodded and said, “Young master, there are no
dangers here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Youngflame
Nong, with a swoosh, scurry to the top of the jade bed. He sat down
in the lotus position, then began to fill the jade bed below him with
elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This jade bed was the
core of this palace, the Vault of Treasures. Every palace had a core,
and if one could bind them all, the entire Immortal estate would be
bound as well. The test the Youngflame clan had given Youngflame Nong
was to have him completely bind this Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. The rest of
you can go,” Youngflame Nong said, seated on the jade bed, “And
search to your hearts’ content for the treasures which Immortal
Witchriver left behind here. I won’t go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang stood at
the jade bed as well, quietly standing guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged a glance, secretly celebrating. If the most powerful member
of their group, the Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang, was not going to compete
with them for treasures, it would be wonderful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already begun
to bind the core of this palace. None of the restrictive spells
within this palace will activate, so the only thing you need to worry
about are golems lying in wait,” Youngflame Nong said with a loud
laugh. “However, my guess is that this palace doesn’t have any
golems left. If there were, they would’ve attacked us long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, we’ll go search for treasures, then.” Ning and the
others didn’t stay here any longer; they immediately departed. They
had arrived in hall together, but now, they immediately parted ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, treasure-hunting is a matter of individual luck,”
Northson said with extraordinary excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There might be
Immortal-ranked magic treasures,” Adept Vastriver said with great
eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s up to
destiny,” Ninelotus said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
They all quickly parted ways. Even the Whitewater Hound and Little
Qing parted ways from Ning, moving out on their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
you’ll be that damn lucky.” Xue Hongyi, at the rear of the
procession, had a cold look on his face. He chose a pathway for
himself, then began to search.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Vault of Treasures,
one of the five palaces of the estate, was simply too vast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And my divine sense
can’t even penetrate through the walls here?” Ning had no other
options; he had to rely on the simplest, most rudimentary of methods
to search; push through the doors of each room and search them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. A stone door
was pushed out. Ning swept the inside of the room with his divine
sense while also scanning it with his eyes. “Not this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. Yet another
stone door was pushed open, and Ning searched this room as well. “Not
this one either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nope.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly searched
through multiple rooms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! Ning pushed
open the door to the sixth room. “Not this one eith-…eh? This
is…?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
turned bloodshot with excitement. He hurriedly shut the door to the
study, then entered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surges of ripples
emanated from the magic treasures in this room. Ning stared at the
magic treasures and sensed the rippling waves of energy coming from
them, and felt as though he were in a dream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually was the
one to discover the true Treasure Vault. It seems I really am lucky.”
Ning swept the room with his gaze. Upon an enormous display case,
there were many magic treasures, including ropes, flying swords,
gongs, disks, needles, awls, nails, sacks, warhammers, seals, staffs,
ribbons, horsetail whisks, fog bottles, jade flasks, colored clothes,
powders, armbands…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The amount of treasure
here was simply astonishing. They all had different auras of power as
well; the ones closest to Ning had ripples of power that were a bit
weaker, while the more distant ones were more powerful. Clearly,
these magic treasures were divided up by power levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many magic
treasures…how could Immortal Witchriver possibly have a use for all
of them?” Ning sighed gently, but suddenly, he thought about the
so-called ‘Witchriver clan’ which he had encountered in the
outside areas of the Immortal estate world. “Right. Immortal
Witchriver, as a Celestial Immortal, naturally had many, many
monstrous attendants. Of course he would want to be able to take good
care of them and provide resources for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like how
Ning had made certain preparations for the Ji clan as well. Immortal
Witchriver had made preparations to strengthen his descendants. In
addition, as a Celestial Immortal, Immortal Witchriver naturally had
far more members in his clan than the Ji clan did. In turn, then, he
would need to be extremely strict in handing out magic treasures. He
must have created this ‘Vault of Treasures’, with clansmen who
had rendered meritorious deeds or who had extremely good talent being
provided gifts. This was only logical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind them!” Ning’s
body instantly emanated streaks of elemental ki, like ribbons of
light, filling the air with them as he shot them towards the magic
treasures. Countless years had passed; even if the treasures did have
masters in the distant pass, by now, there wasn’t even the
slightest bit of vestigial ki within them, and they were extremely
easy to bind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are
Mortal-ranked. These are Earth-ranked…I’m unable to bind this
one! Haha, it has to at least be a Heaven-ranked magic treasure.”
Ning could no longer remain calm, beginning to laugh wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had hit the jackpot!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had truly hit the
jackpot today. This was a stroke of tremendously good fortune. He
originally had thought that Immortal Witchriver would carry his most
important treasures with him, and thus logically the Vault of
Treasures wouldn’t have too many treasures within, but in reality,
within this treasure room, there was a veritable sea of treasures,
all of which Immortal Witchriver had prepared for his clansmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few poor Witchriver
clansmen had been trapped within the Vault of Treasures after
Immortal Witchriver’s death, forever unable to leave. They had died
within the vault of old age. Fortunately, however, the Witchriver
clansmen outside the vault had some other treasures as well. Still,
despite that, they were only able to be local hegemons in the outside
world of this Immortal estate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In as much time as was
needed to boil a kettle of tea, Ning completely bound everything he
could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heavens.” Ning
took a deep breath, his heart pounding so loudly, he felt as though
he could audibly hear his heartbeats. This was simply too amazing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than 180,000
Mortal-ranked treasures, more than 16,000 Earth-ranked treasures, and
more than a hundred treasures which I could not bind.” Ning was
somewhat stunned. This…this was too amazing. Although he had
already been an extremely wealthy Wanxiang Adept, compared to this
sea of treasures…there was no comparison at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Loose Immortals
and Earth Immortals probably don’t have this much,” Ning sighed
in amazement. “Celestial Immortals live up to their reputation.
Even a small fraction of their wealth is far beyond what ordinary
Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals possess.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m taking this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My precious, my
precious, all of you, come here.” Ning was absolutely giddy. He
collected up all the Mortal-ranked magic treasures, storing them in
his storage magic treasure, then stored all of the Earth-ranked magic
treasures into his Zifu region. His Zifu was incomparably vast; even
the 16,000-plus Earth-ranked magic treasures only took up a small
corner of his Zifu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning, with a
flash, instantly arrived next to one of the longest display counters.
This display counter was covered with magic treasures that emanated
powerful ripples; Ning wasn’t able to bind any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unless I’m
mistaken, these should be Heaven-ranked,” Ning said softly.
Although he was unable to bind them, which meant they could also be
Immortal-ranked treasures, logic argued against it. Although the
magic treasures atop this long table emanated ripples that were
different in power, the general strength of the ripples were roughly
on the same level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, some were
middle-grade Heaven-ranked magic treasures, while others were
high-grade or even top-grade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Primal Daoists
generally only have a few Heaven-ranked magic treasures, but I have
more than a hundred. And, given that they were stored away by a
Celestial Immortal, I imagine that none of them are weak.” Ning
could feel his blood pumping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even the weakest, low-grade Heaven-ranked magic treasures could
only be purchased with five hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence. Slightly better treasures would cost much more, upwards of
five thousand kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If, theoretically…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If all of these
hundred-plus magic treasures were Heaven-ranked, and all of them were
slightly better than low-grade, without a single top-grade…they
would still be worth nearly five hundred thousand kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence! This was a sum that was enough to cause
even Earth Immortals or Loose Immortals to feel their hearts tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial Immortal
could pluck a hair from his head, and it would still be thicker than
my legs. And what I have here isn’t just one of his ‘hairs’…it’s
more like one of his ‘legs’!” Ji Ning was simply too excited.
He actually began to ramble and spout nonsense, while mentally
calculating the worth of these Heaven-ranked magic treasures. The
powerful ripples emanating from them caused Ning to feel incomparably
delighted, especially because several of the ripples were extremely
strong, which caused Ning to feel even more pleasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]? Just 700 Earth-ranked magic
treasures…that’s nothing!” Ning continued to celebrate. “In
training to the Second Cycle of the [Six Cycles of the Starseizer],
I’ll also need a lot of precious materials, but with this, I can go
trade for them at the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he had been
extremely tight on money. He felt that he was extremely poor, unable
to buy this and unable to buy that. Now, however, he suddenly felt
that he was extremely rich. Even ordinary Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals were a bit less wealthy than him! But of course, some of
the top-class Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals were still
wealthier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” After
savoring the feeling for a while, Ning began to collect these
powerful Heaven-ranked magic treasures as well. As he was unable to
bind them for now, he had no choice but to put them within his
storage-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This trip with
Youngflame Nong to this Celestial Immortal’s estate was absolutely
worth it. Celestial Immortals…Celestial Immortals…they really
live up to their reputations.” Ning had completely cleaned out all
of the treasures within this room. Suddenly, he blinked. “Hey…these
display tables that held the magic treasures…the wood seems to be
quite extraordinary. Slumberghost Waterwood? A single kilogram of it
is equivalent in value to two taels…there has to be a million
kilograms worth of Slumberghost Waterwood here. Mm, makes
sense…Immortal Witchriver put the magic treasures on the display
tables for his descendants to look at. Of course he had to procure
some good tables. I’m taking this as well! And this one here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning collected up all
of the tables and cases within this room as well. The entire room was
now completely empty. Not a single thing was left.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - An Immortal-Ranked Magic Treasure Emerges
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, feeling
incomparably delighted, walked out of the treasure storeroom. “This
was a tremendous stroke of fortune. No wonder so many Immortal
cultivators, despite knowing some places are dangerous, insist on
going into them. It is because they hope for strokes of fortune like
this. With such wealth…my power will increase tremendously, and my
ability to stay alive will improve tremendously as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as he had
enough treasures, he would be able to trade for what he needed at the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life-saving items,
fleeing items, support items, Ki Refining techniques, divine
abilities…as long as he was willing to pay a high enough price, he
could acquire them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning currently
had those two extremely powerful life-protecting items from the
underwater estate, one of which had even been personally created by
Daoist Threelives…two wasn’t enough. The likes of young master
Youngflame definitely carried more than ten life-saving items by his
side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had so many
treasures to begin with, my earthfire and dire-ice would’ve been
raised to the first grade long ago.” Ning continued to advance
through the corridors at high speed, pushing open the doors to one
study after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. “Nothing
here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing here
either.” Ning continued to search.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how enormous the
Vault of Treasures was, aside from the items treasure storeroom he
had located, there might be other treasures present. Just as Ning was
continuing to relaxedly search, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire region
seemed to tremble, causing Ning’s skin and hair to begin to shake.
Ning couldn’t help but turn his head to look at the corridor behind
him. Deep from the ends of that corridor, an incomparably powerful
ripple was surging forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A magic treasure
ripple.” Ning, having seen so many magic treasures earlier in the
treasure hall, immediately came to this conclusion. “In addition,
this ripple is far more powerful than the ripples that were given off
by the Heaven-ranked magic treasures in that storeroom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a thought
flashed past Ning’s mind. Immortal-ranked magic treasure! “It has
to be an Immortal-ranked treasure.” Ning instantly swept forward,
moving towards the direction of the ripple at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This material is
excellent. I can use it to create constructs.” Northson was
searching within the palace as well, and he didn’t hold back at
all. He immediately collected all of the drapes, tables, and prayer
mats he found on his path through. “Just now, I discovered
long-decayed corpses with magic treasures that even I am unable to
bind. I imagine they must be Heaven-ranked, while the dead were
Primal Diremonsters. Heh heh, one more corpse, please, one more
corpse!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Immortal
Witchriver had died, the palace had instantly become sealed off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
those granted access to this palace were experts of high status.
However, trapped within, they had no escape, eventually dying of old
age! They left behind their corpses, and all of the treasures next to
the corpses were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One more corpse,
please…” Northson’s gaze was blazing as he continued to search.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful ripple
surged forth. Northson was momentarily stunned, and then he
immediately turned to face a sideways, curving corridor, letting out
a surprised howl. “It must be an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.”
And then, he immediately transformed into a streak of light, flying
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why doesn’t this
Vault of Treasures have anything? I wonder if the others found
anything.” Adept Vastriver had nothing to show for his efforts,
finding nothing on his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Adept
Vastriver suddenly came to a halt, sensing that powerful ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such a powerful
ripple…it must be an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.” Given that
he had fragments of memories from his past life, some naturally
involved Immortal-ranked magic treasures. Adept Vastriver’s eyes
instantly turned red with desire, and he immediately transformed into
a streak of light, hurrying forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them, scattered
throughout the palace, advanced at high speed towards the source of
the ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal-ranked
magic treasure was within an extremely large and quiet secret room.
The room was very large. The insides, however, were quite empty. The
red-robed youth, Xue Hongyi, was currently staring, mouth hanging
open, at a nearby oil lamp. Above the lamp, there was an azure,
blazing flame. The area around the tiny lamp was filled with circles
upon circles of flames, all of which emanated powerful ripples,
forcibly preventing Xue Hongyi from reaching out to seize it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This,
this…Immortal-ranked magic treasure?!” Xue Hongyi felt that this
really was his lucky today. Just now, when he had entered, he had
seen that to the side of the room, there was a seemingly ordinary
decorative lamp. Only, a fire was blazing within the oil lamp,
causing him to feel intrigued. What he had thought to himself was,
“Given that Immortal Witchriver has died countless hundreds of
millions of years ago, for this lamp to remain burning means that it
must be extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately had
stretched his hand out to collect it into his storage-type magic
treasure, but as he was about to do so, the lamp suddenly exploded
with awe-inspiring might. Circles of fire blazed out from within the
lamp, emanating a powerful, rippling energy aura that easily
deflected him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, who says Ji
Ning is the only lucky one around? I, Xue Hongyi, can be lucky as
well. This Immortal-ranked magic artifact is mine.” Xue Hongyi was
incomparably excited. He produced a horsetail whisk within his hand,
then swept out with it. The white threads on the whisk immediately
flew out, moving to surround the oil lamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The oil lamp remained
where it was, but the flames around it began to blaze even greater,
forcibly keeping the threads at bay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” A look of
amazement appeared on Xue Hongyi’s face. “I can’t take it, even
when I’m using a magic treasure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A puny Wanxiang
wants to be my master?” The flame atop the oil lamp suddenly
transformed into the face of a child, which then stared angrily at
Xue Hongyi. “You had best know your own limits and quickly depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi, however,
only felt all the more delighted. According to the legends,
Immortal-ranked magic treasures would give birth to treasure-spirits
which could speak in the human tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is as the legends
say. They really are capable of human speech. An Immortal-ranked
treasure!” Xue Hongyi’s eyes were shining. The entire Snowdragon
Mountain was not in possession of a single Immortal-ranked magic
treasure, but now, he had a chance to acquire one! A tremendous bit
of luck had befallen him; it would be a sin to to anything besides
seize it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasure, you
had best obediently follow me.” A snowy white ribbon appeared in
front of Xue Hongyi, the power of it clearly much greater than the
previous treasure. This was one of Xue Hongyi’s most favored magic
treasures, and it went sweeping in an entangling manner towards the
lamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lamp remained where
it was. It was, after all, only an Immortal-ranked magic treasure; it
wasn’t yet able to fly about and move about on its own. However, it
was capable of manifesting a bit of its might…and even just a small
portion of the might of an Immortal-ranked magic treasure, was not
something which an ordinary Wanxiang Adept could handle. The circles
of fire around it began to grow even larger, and the ripples it
manifested grew even stronger, managing to forcibly block Xue
Hongyi’s white ribbon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t able to
collect me. Your power is lacking, lacking by far.” The
blaze-turned-toddler face sneered, “You had best leave now. If
someone who is weak acquires an Immortal-ranked magic treasure, it
will only be a disaster, not a blessing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I can take you
and trade you for top-grade Heaven-ranked magic items and many other
treasures. Alternately, I can go to the local Raindragon Guard branch
and immediately enter secluded meditation, only leaving once I reach
the Primal level…by then, my power will greatly expand, and
Snowdragon Mountain will hold me in reverence.” Xue Hongyi’s eyes
were filled with madness. “I refuse to believe I can’t collect
you, an inanimate object!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi used magic
treasures repeatedly, attempting to capture it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he simply
could not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t dare use
his own hand to snatch it; after all, he wasn’t a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. Upon doing so, he would probably be burnt to ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.” Ripples
of power suddenly came from outside, and the stone door began to be
pushed open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone’s coming
in.” Xue Hongyi could no longer afford to wait. “GET OVER HERE!”
Xue Hongyi let out a howl, then executed a forbidden technique. His
face turned completely red, and a series of flying needles flew out,
exploding with power and transforming into a gigantic hand that
grabbed the lamp, smothering and breaking the flames surrounding it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GET IN!” He
immediately collected the Immortal-ranked magic treasure. Only now
did Xue Hongyi turn his body, only to see that two figures had
appeared from behind; Ji Ning and Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Decisive and
vicious,” Ning said softly. Xue Hongyi just grinned, seeming quite
smug. At the critical moment, he had executed a forbidden technique
and collected the Immortal-ranked magic treasure. He, too, felt that
he had been quite decisive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, you
were a step too late.” Xue Hongyi gave Ning a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was an
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp!” Yu Wei said softly, “It can be used to
nourish skyfire and raise it to the first grade in power! In
addition, the azuresilk godfire within it can be activated to attack
enemies. It will pose a grave threat to even Loose Immortals,
although it isn’t very effective against Celestial Immortals…still,
it can be considered an excellent Immortal-ranked magic treasure. If
it were to be sold to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, it could fetch
a price of 1.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
1.5 million? And, according to what Yu Wei said, it seemed as though
this Azuresilk Godfire Lamp was similar to the Earthfire Heartlamp in
effect, capable of nourishing skyfire to the first grade! And it
could also be used to fight against enemies…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.
A series of figures flew out; Ninelotus, Adept Vastriver, Northson,
the Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal-ranked
magic treasure? Where is it?” Northson hurriedly looked around,
then stared at Xue Hongyi. “It wasn’t acquired by Xue Hongyi, was
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was him,” Yu
Wei explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the largest hall
within the Vault of Treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong was
seated in the lotus position, continuously working to bind the hall.
He, too, could sense the powerful ripples emanating from the
Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There actually is an
Immortal-ranked treasure?” Youngflame Nong said, surprised, “Was
Immortal Witchriver so wealthy that he wouldn’t keep all of his
Immortal-ranked treasures by his side?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful experts would
keep their most powerful artifacts by their side. A Celestial
Immortal would generally have multiple Immortal-ranked magic
treasures. Youngflame Nong had originally felt certain that the
Witchriver Immortal Estate would have no Immortal-ranked magic
treasures within, and so he didn’t care about the treasures here at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, are
you going to take action?” Xiangliu Fang asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.”
Youngflame Nong shook his head. “I have, after all, made a promise
in the name of the clan. In addition, they will be needed within this
Immortal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once they are no
longer of use…” Youngflame Nong’s eyes suddenly flickered with
a bit of heat. “I have to say, that Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei…she
really is quite fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang laughed.
He knew exactly what his master was thinking about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, when
the time comes, you just need to give a few subtle hints, and Yu Wei
will know how she should act. She’s merely a reincarnated Immortal;
to Immortal cultivators, the most important thing is their
cultivation paths. The pleasures of the flesh are, by comparison, a
minor matter. For the sake of being able to proceed to greater
heights on her path, she will yield to you, young master.” Xiangliu
Fang spoke in a soft voice; his young master, in the imperial
capital, was quite a lavish, generous spender.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the future
Godplume Duke! Given his status, the types of pleasures he enjoyed
were quite extravagant as well. It was actually quite common for
reincarnated female Immortals to submit to being maidservants for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not the same. This
Yu Wei isn’t like the others; she’s even better than those I had
in the imperial capital.” Youngflame Nong licked his lower lip.
“But as for that Ninelotus, heh heh…her demeanor and aura is
quite extraordinary as well. People from large, top-tier clans like
her know how to judge a situation. I imagine that it would be a bit
easier to convince her to play with me a few times. Yu Wei will
probably be harder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about…”
Xiangliu Fang’s voice grew even softer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. I still
need them.” Youngflame Nong shook his head. “Some matters are
more important than others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Xiangliu
Fang nodded.

Chapter 13 - The Humble Xue Hongyi
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Yu Wei, Ninelotus, Adept Vastriver, the
Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing were all staring towards Xue
Hongyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The allure of an
Immortal-ranked magic artifact was incomparably great. Although Adept
Vastriver had been a Loose Immortal in his past life, he had never
acquired an Immortal-ranked magic treasure…for the sake of such a
treasure, even the annihilation of entire clans and sects was not
uncommon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t we kill
them, then take the Immortal-ranked magic treasure to the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain and trade it for liquefied elemental essence? We
can split it evenly,” Adept Vastriver sent mentally, a hint of
coldness in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all
hesitating, but the most determined one was Adept Vastriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xue Hongyi
weren’t exactly on good terms; in the past, Xue Hongyi had even
intended to try and capture Ning. Fortunately, Northmont Baiwei had
stopped him. Ning didn’t feel any compunctions against killing Xue
Hongyi…but they had entered this Immortal estate together. And,
when they had done so, Youngflame Nong had already given them a
strongly worded warning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you
planning on doing?” Xue Hongyi shouted, “Previously, when we
arrived at this Witchriver Immortal Estate, young master Youngflame
said on the warship that we were forbidden from fighting against each
other!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi was mentally
panicking as well. Although Youngflame Nong had issued this warning,
the reality was that at this point in time, these five disciples of
the Black-White College were definitely more important to Youngflame
Nong than Xue Hongyi was. If they really were to kill Xue Hongyi,
most likely Youngflame Nong wouldn’t be too upset about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Youngflame
Nong had said these words: “After we enter the Witchriver Immortal
Estate, we have to be of one mind and work together. We cannot fight
internally. If anyone causes chaos inside, then don’t blame me,
Youngflame Nong, for becoming cruel and unfeeling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is there to
fear? We five disciples of the Black-White College are more important
to Youngflame Nong,” Adept Vastriver sent mentally. “After we
kill Xue Hongyi, Youngflame Nong definitely wouldn’t act against
us; that would be like breaking his own arms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t act
against us now, but after he binds this Immortal estate, we won’t
be of use to him and he’ll be able to act against us,” Ninelotus
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Act against us? We
aren’t so easily dealt with. What’s more, you, Ninelotus, are the
next leader of the Dongyan clan. Youngflame Nong won’t dare to act
too rashly; after all, he’s currently just an ordinary disciple of
the Youngflame clan who has a high chance of becoming the next
Godplume Duke; he’s not the actual Godplume Duke yet. If he dares
to act against you…his inheritance might actually be seized and
stolen by another,” Adept Vastriver said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t act
against senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus, but he would act against
us,” Yu Wei sent mentally. “If we don’t kill Xue Hongyi, then
he won’t have an excuse to attack us, because he previously gave us
a promise. But once we actually kill Xue Hongyi, then we’ll have
given him an excuse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whether or not an
excuse was created was of great importance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all matters, one
needed to occupy the moral high ground. After all, behind Ning and
the others were powerful forces such as the Black-White College and
the Dongyan clan. If Ning and the others were extremely weak and
without much influence, then simply killing them might not matter.
But because they did have backgrounds…in all matters , there was a
need to occupy the moral high ground before dealing with them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We cannot give him
an excuse. After all, that Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, is far more
powerful than us,” Yu Wei said. “As for Xue Hongyi…after we
leave, we can find another chance to get rid of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree with senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei.” Ning expressed his opinion mentally as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver
frowned. Of the five of them, himself, Ning, and Yu Wei were the most
powerful. With Ning and Yu Wei disagreeing…while Vastriver was
capable of defeating Xue Hongyi, he wasn’t certain of being able to
kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Adept
Vastriver turned his head and left. Ning and the others exchanged a
glance, then all left as well. The only one left in the room was Xue
Hongyi, who finally let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, I was
able to rely on Youngflame Nong to scare them off,” Xue Hongyi
mused to himself. “After we leave the Witchriver Immortal Estate, I
need to immediately stick very close to young master Youngflame, and
then find a chance to use a Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal and flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood that
successfully escaping might be difficult. But he had to take the
risk; for the sake of this Immortal-ranked magic treasure, he had to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, he didn’t
even dare trust the three Primal Daoists of Snowdragon Mountain. In
the Immortal path, it was not rare for disciples to kill their
masters and ancestors, and it was even more common for masters to
kill disciples. For the sake of acquiring an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure…anything might happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
spread out, once more continuing to search through the palace for
treasures. After all, this was the Vault of Treasures of a Celestial
Immortal; any random treasure would be worth more than the entire
holdings of an ordinary Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They carefully searched
for another hour. Each of them had completely searched the entire
palace. They all believed that it might be possible that the others
might have missed searching a spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m finished.
Master, I don’t have anything, not even a single magic treasure.”
The distant Little Qing was chatting mentally with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not a single magic
treasure? That’s so sad!” Ning teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ask Uncle White and
see if he found any treasures,” Little Qing sent back through their
spirit-link.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, I’ll
ask.” Ning sent spiritually to the Whitewater Hound, “Uncle
White, have you finished your search?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m finished.”
The Whitewater Hound’s mental voice seemed quite delighted. “My
luck wasn’t bad. I discovered a corpse, which had a magic robe and
some other treasures near it. I don’t know if it was left behind by
a Loose Immortal or a Primal Diremonsters, but all the treasures are
excellent. I’m not able to bind them; they should be Heaven-ranked
magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Vault of Treasures
actually could be said to be the most important of the five palaces.
It had the most treasures, and thus it was normally guarded by
monstrous experts that were at least at the Primal or Loose Immortal
levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Loose Immortals
generally wouldn’t have access to an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure, and so it was quite hard to judge from magic treasures
alone if they were left behind by a Loose Immortal or a Primal
Diremonster. Only after binding the storage items and seeing how many
treasures were inside it would one know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master, how
did Uncle White do? Did he also find nothing?” Little Qing sent
spiritually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White’s luck
was better than yours; he acquired the treasures from a skeletal
corpse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A corpse? His luck
was actually better than mine? I’m an Azure Skyserpent; it’s as
easy for me to encounter a stroke of luck as it is to eat rice. I’m
surrounded by good fortune…but his luck was better than mine?
Master, what about you? Did you find any treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I acquired…even
more than Uncle White,” Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even more?! How can
this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the largest hall
in the palace. Youngflame Nong remained seated in the lotus position
on the jade bed, continuing to bind it, while Xiangliu Fang stood to
one side. Ning and the others had all regrouped here together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Vault of
Treasures. It should be the place within the Witchriver Immortal
Estate which was meant for the storage of treasures, and the place
with the most treasures. By the looks of it, you have all gained
quite a bit.” Youngflame Nong sat above them, smiling. “And just
now, I could sense some ripples; it should have been an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure emerging. I wonder which of you was so
lucky as to acquire the Immortal-ranked treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all turned their heads, looking towards Xue Hongyi in unison. Xue
Hongyi was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, so it was you,
Xue Hongyi?” Youngflame Nong raised an eyebrow. Earlier, when
trapped within the formation, Xue Hongyi had hid far away and
abandoned Youngflame Nong. This caused Youngflame Nong to feel
ill-will towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, I am willing to offer this Immortal-ranked magic treasure
to you,” Xue Hongyi said hurriedly. Against Ji Ning’s group, he
was willing to threaten them and struggle against them, but young
master Youngflame was simply too powerful. In terms of both
background and political power, Youngflame Nong could completely
crush him. In terms of personal power, that Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang,
could probably annihilate him with one blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
looked over with surprise. Offering it to young master Youngflame?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures should go
to the worthy!” Xue Hongyi said hurriedly. “I, Xue Hongyi,
acknowledge that I am lacking in worthiness; a treasure like this, to
me, is a disaster, not a blessing. It is better for me to offer it to
you, young master Youngflame. It is only natural and reasonable that
someone as exalted as you, young master Younglame, be the possessor
of this treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He liked those who knew
how to flatter, especially when the flatterer was a fairly powerful
genius. Ji Ning and the others were from the Black-White College; all
of them were proud by nature, and there was no way they could debase
themselves to flatter in this way. Xue Hongyi, however, had lowered
his head and bent his waist, truly humbling himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
promised, in the name of my Youngflame clan, that the treasures you
acquire will belong to you. I absolutely will not fight with you for
them, or ask you to offer them,” Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t
fighting with me, nor is it asking me to offer it up…this is a
normal trade,” Xue Hongyi said hurriedly. “This Immortal-ranked
magic treasure, the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp, isn’t very useful to
me. I’m willing to trade it to you, young master Youngflame, for
some other treasures. You can just give me some random Heaven-ranked
magic treasures and it would suffice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are
over-thinking things.” Youngflame Nong shook his head. “No matter
what, I will not accept this Immortal-ranked magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Xue Hongyi
let out a mental sigh of relief. He had proactively offered the
treasure, but young master Youngflame had declined. Now, he was calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xue Hongyi is quite
the clever fellow,” Youngflame Nong mused secretly to himself. “I
can’t accept it now. If I did, the hearts of Ji Ning and his group
would turn cold! They are still very useful to me. After I bind the
immortal estate…at that point, I can have Xue Hongyi offer it to me
again. If necessary, I can just bestow a few treasures upon him in
exchange.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After two full hours
later, Youngflame Nong finally completed binding the jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, the binding is
finally complete.” Youngflame Nong walked down from the jade bed, a
smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master,” the
nearby Xiangliu Fang said with a frown, “Right now, the two most
powerful monstrous forces in the entire Immortal estate world are
waiting outside. As soon as we emerge, we will most likely suffer
their immediate attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two most
powerful monstrous forces?” Ning and the others were all startled.
The titanic wave formed from more than ten thousand Dao-soldiers, and
the giant Yaksha Dao-soldier formation formed by the Witchriver clan?
Those were capable of completely suppressing even the Fiendgod,
Xiangliu Fang; he had been forced to rely on his astonishing
recuperative abilities and evasive techniques in order to escape with
his life. He hadn’t been able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can stay alive,
but I am not confident in being able to protect the young master.”
This was Xiangliu Fang’s worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Youngflame
Nong frowned slightly. “You say they are waiting outside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They’ve
been waiting outside the entire time,” Xiangliu Fang growled.
“They’ve been trapped for countless years within this Immortal
estate world; every generation has always dreamed of leaving and
going to the vast Grand Xia Empire. Thus, they will definitely stop
at nothing and be willing to pay any price in order to seize the key
to the Immortal estate you hold, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong nodded.
He could understand the powerful desire and urge these two monstrous
forces had to leave. It was a desire to see the greater world, a
desire that would lead them to use all their might in acting against
Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be
trouble.” Youngflame Nong gritted his teeth. Ning and the others
all stood there, racking their brains. What to do?
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 14 - The Immortal Grass Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strong are the
Dao-soldiers of the monsters in this Immortal estate world?”
Youngflame Nong frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood that the
biggest obstacles to him binding this Immortal estate were the local
monster races present. They had all been trapped in this tiny world
for far too long; every generation dreamed of leaving. This sort of
powerful desire was something which would cause them to be willing to
sacrifice anything. The worst thing was, these monstrous Dao-soldiers
were all extremely powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two most
powerful forces are the Titanwave Dao-soldier formation and the
Yaksha Dao-soldier formation,” Xiangliu Fang said. “These two
forces both have more than ten thousand Dao-soldiers, and the leaders
of each are at the Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both are at the
Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal level?” Youngflame Nong was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They each
should have one,” Xiangliu Fang said. “The Titanwave Dao-soldier
formation’s leader should be a bit stronger. As for the Yaksha
Dao-soldier formation’s leader, although their Immortal is a bit
weaker, as a whole, they are stronger…against these two forces,
even the most supreme of Loose Immortals would be beaten so badly
they would have no choice but to flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang was a
true, primordial Fiendgod, and one of the Hydraga race at that.
Although he was at the peak Primal level, he was comparable to a
supreme Loose Immortal in actual combat power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slightly weaker
Titanwave Dao-soldier formation was already powerful enough to force
Xiangliu Fang into constant flight. The Yaksha Dao-soldier formation
was also able to dominate Xiangliu Fang with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t too
likely that we would be able to defeat them.” Xiangliu Fang shook
his head. “Even if a few extra Loose Immortals came, it would be
far from being enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal estate
has five palaces in total,” Youngflame Nong said in a low voice.
“Right now, I’ve bound one of them. I’m confident in being able
to move to the other two palaces, but the final two will be
troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, you are confident in being able to go to two palaces?”
Mu Northson said with surprise, “Since you can go to two, why can’t
you go to all four?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
looked towards Youngflame Nong, confused. The two monstrous forces
were waiting outside; how were they supposed to charge past them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t
understand,” Youngflame Nong said with a laugh, “I’ve already
bound this Vault of Treasures. This palace is extremely large, one of
the five main pillars of the entire Immortal estate world, capable of
affecting an area of ten thousand kilometers around it. By relying on
the key to the Immortal estate, I can open a corridor, allowing us to
exit this palace at any location within ten thousand kilometers of
this palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If these two
monstrous forces choose to just wait close nearby, then I can move us
to a location thousands of kilometers away from them. Afterwards, by
relying on Uncle Fang’s evasive techniques, we can hurry towards
the next palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others now
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I bind all
five palaces, I can appear in any location within this Immortal
estate world!” Youngflame Nong sighed, “But right now, I’ve
only bound one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, by using this ability,” Xue Hongyi said with astonished
delight, “Can’t you just go into all four of the palaces? There’s
no way these monstrous forces can possibly prevent us from entering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are wrong.”
Youngflame Nong shook his head and sighed. “They have been sealed
within this Immortal estate world for too long, and so they’ve
forgotten about the power of the palaces. But once I use the palace
to move us to a location thousands of kilometers away…as soon as I
use this technique, they’ll know that it is possible for us to do
this. By then, they will probably go and guard the palaces which I
have yet to bind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The looks on everyone’s
faces grew solemn. Right! Five major palaces…there was no need for
the monstrous forces to wait for them outside. They could just go and
completely surround and guard the palaces that had yet to be bound!
For the sake of binding the Immortal estate, Youngflame Nong would
still have to charge towards them, even though he knew that the
unbound palaces were now surrounded in rings of protection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lying in wait to
catch the hare!” Ning murmured this saying to himself. “The
unbound palaces…Youngflame Nong has to go there. As long as they
surround the unbound palaces with layers of protection, then…there
will be no way for us to avoid them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lying in wait to catch
the hare was a seemingly clumsy technique. But this technique was
aimed at their weak point; Ning’s group would have no other options
other than to fall into the trap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, there’s
nothing we can do. Let’s first go bind two of the palaces,”
Youngflame Nong said. “Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around the
pillar of light which represented the Vault of Treasures. The two
most powerful monstrous forces of this world were gathered here. The
Titanwave Dao-soldier formation and the Yaksha Dao-soldier formation
were both present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Duohe, this time,
the two of us should set aside our differences and work together to
deal with the humans and seize the key to the Immortal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witchsui, if your
Witchriver clan is willing to join forces, I naturally will be
delighted to comply.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the two most
powerful figures of the entire Immortal estate world. One was an old
Loose Immortal, Immortal Duohe, who had lived for more than a hundred
thousand years. The other was Immortal Witchsui, who had only lived
for ten thousand years. The two of them immediately swore an oath to
the Dao of the Heavens to join forces on this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of being
able to leave, they would be willing to sacrifice anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides continued
to wait quietly. A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The two Loose
Immortals, as well as some Primal Diremonsters, simultaneously turned
their heads to stare thousands of kilometers away. There, a warship
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. And then, aboard the warship,
Xiangliu Fang’s body suddenly blurred, transforming into an
enormous Fiendgod that was three thousand meters tall, with the lower
body of a serpent and nine heads. The Fiendgod Hydraga clutched the
warship in his claws, then used an evasive technique, fleeing at an
utterly astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He left behind only a
streak of light in the air. This caused both Immortal Duohe and the
Witchriver clan to be flabbergasted. They knew very well that in
terms of speed, they couldn’t possibly catch up with that Fiendgod.
Since they had already started at a distance of thousands of
kilometers…there was no hope at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this be?
How could they have suddenly appeared thousands of kilometers away?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When they had
entered the palace, they had all been very close to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They had to be very
close to enter…why were they able to leave at a distance of
thousands of kilometers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even countless years
ago, when Immortal Witchriver was still alive and the master of this
place, his clansmen didn’t fully understand the special powers of
these palaces. And now that countless years had passed? How could
these monsters possibly understand them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They must have bound
the palace. The palace is under their control, which is why they were
able to do something so unique,” Immortal Duohe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That has to be the
case,” Immortal Witchsui agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal estate
has five palaces in total. They’ve only bound one. There are four
which remain unbound. Let us each guard one of the unbound palaces;
unless they give up their quest, they will have to fight us head on,”
Immortal Duohe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides quickly
agreed on a plan, and they howled through the air as they flew at
high speed towards two of the distant golden Skypillars of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The worst case
scenario has already come to pass.” The nine-headed, serpent-bodied
Hydraga was still clutching the warship. Within the warship,
Youngflame Nong, Ji Ning, and the others were watching those two
distant monstrous powers begin to move. They hadn’t moved to pursue
or attack; rather, they had flown off into two different directions,
towards two of those golden Skypillars of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to bind this
Immortal estate.” Youngflame Nong gritted his teeth. “These
monsters…damn them. Damn them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the enormous
Hydraga Fiendgod, warship in one hand, had arrived at one of the
other golden Skypillars of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.” Youngflame
Nong activated the key to the Immortal estate, opening up a corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all felt a certain somberness. They were able to easily enter this
time, but that was only because there were no monsters blocking them.
Two of the five palaces, however, were now under heavy guard; how
could those two palaces be so easily traversed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hydraga shrank
himself, once more entering the warship, and the entire warship flew
into the opened tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An incomparably massive
hall, so large that it was more than a thousand times larger than the
first hall they had entered in the Vault of Treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s so big.”
Ning’s group was completely amazed. Looking at this world felt like
looking at an entire continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This utterly massive
hall actually really was a miniature sealed world. In the skies above
it, a ‘sun’ was blazing with endless light and heat. In the earth
below, there were countless types of spirit-grass and spirit-fruit
that were growing. During the passage of countless years, the
Immortal grass here had been taken care of by some constructs, but
hadn’t truly been nourished properly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These types of
spirit-grass and spirit-fruit generally needed many unique treasures
in order to grow properly. Still, despite that, after the passage of
countless years, some truly rare and precious specimens of
spirit-grass and spirit-fruit had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal grass and
Immortal fruit!” Ning and the others were overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHOOSH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the Fiendgod
Hydraga by Youngflame Nong’s side stretched his hands out. His
hands quickly increased in size as his fingers transformed into ten
giant snakes, covering the skies as they swept out towards the entire
region of Immortal grass. In a twinkling, the eighteen types of
Immortal grass and spirit-fruit with the densest elemental auras were
all plucked clean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl…damn you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Master’s
Immortal Grass Palace. You dared to steal his Immortal grass…damn
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three golems came
flying out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod Hydraga
sent one of his giant hands outwards in a backhanded blow. The three
golems were instantly sent flying away, smashing against the distant
walls. And then, Xiangliu Fang sent out another hand to grab them,
tossing the three Primal-level golems into his own large sack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did Xiangliu
Fang come to a stop, standing there calmly by Youngflame Nong’s
side, as though nothing had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uhh….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
stared towards the Fiendgod Hydraga in astonishment. There was no way
they could compete against Xiangliu Fang, when he chose to act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures will
go to whoever obtains them. I said these words earlier. Since Uncle
Fang obtained them, those things will go to Uncle Fang,” Youngflame
Nong laughed. “There is still quite a bit of spirit-fruit and
spirit-grass remaining. Although their medicinal value is a bit
lower, they still are very good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t help but curse in secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This medicinal garden
left behind by Immortal Witchriver, despite the passage of countless
years, had never received the top-tier treatment it deserved. The
‘large fish ate the small fish, and the small fish ate the shrimp’;
as a result, eighteen truly Immortal-grade spirit-fruit and
spirit-grass had emerged. All of the other remaining Immortal grass
and Immortal fruit had had much of their spiritual energy stolen by
those eighteen. Although all of them were unhappy, Ji Ning and the
others, including Xue Hongyi, still hurriedly went to collect all of
the Immortal grass and Immortal fruit remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal Grass
Palace is an empty place; there are barely any rooms here.”
Youngflame Ning quickly discovered the core of this palace; it was a
quite, secluded little room built right next to the Immortal grass
garden. The entire room was the core of this palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you can
do some sightseeing outside. You might find some treasures.”
Youngflame Nong calmly entered the room, beginning to bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
cursed in secret. Immortal Grass Palace, Immortal Grass Palace …from
the name alone, one could tell that the treasures within consisted of
Immortal grass. The Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, had already taken the
most valuable specimens for himself; what other treasures could they
possibly find?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite that, Ning and
the others still separated and began a quick search. Unfortunately,
this Immortal Grass Palace didn’t have so much as a single skeleton
within it. It made sense; this was Immortal Witchriver’s personal
medicinal garden. He trusted his own constructs above all, and thus
forbade any of his clansmen from entering this palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already bound
the Immortal Grass Palace,” Youngflame Nong laughed. “Come. Let
us go to the next palace.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three thousand
meter tall Hydraga Fiendgod, warship in hand, once more used his
evasive techniques to move towards a third palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These local
monsters…” Youngflame Nong stared coldly into the distance. Of
the five Skypillars of golden light, two of them were tightly
surrounded by dense clusters of Dao-soldiers. “After I bind this
Immortal estate, I am definitely going to summon the clan’s army
and enslave all of these local monsters. They will forever serve our
Youngflame clan in battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local monsters of
this Immortal estate were all exceptionally powerful. Even after
binding the Immortal estate, Youngflame Nong wouldn’t be able to do
anything to these powerful monsters. Still, behind him, there was the
even more powerful Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what method do you think young master Youngflame
will use in order to bind the final two palaces? It seems quite
difficult to me. The monsters present really are a bit too powerful,”
Mu Northson sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate Youngflame Nong. He is one of the ‘Four Dukelings’
of the imperial capital; since he has dared to come accept this
trial, he definitely has many things up his sleeve,” Ji Ning sent
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Soon, Ning’s
group entered a new palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the midst of the
sky-covering Titanwave Dao-soldier formation. The leader was a
silver-haired, feather-robed, middle-aged man. His eyes flashed with
electricity, and his bearing was graceful and leisurely. He was the
the most powerful and longest living figure within this Immortal
estate world; Immortal Duohe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, the moment
has come for the destinies of all of us within this world to be
changed. I won’t try to invade or to assimilate you.” Immortal
Duohe stared into the distance. Right in front of him, there was
another massive wave. This was a wave formed from one of the lesser
monstrous powers of this world; all of the weaker monsters had been
invited to come over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal estate
world was simply too small; it was very easy for them to gather
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can even swear an
oath to the Dao of the Heavens that I am willing to enter an alliance
with you to work together against that Fiendgod and those humans,”
Immortal Duohe said. “We have to acquire that key. As long as we
can acquire the key…all of us who live within this Immortal estate
world can leave and go to the wider world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Duohe, you
might not act against us, but what about the Witchriver clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.
Witchsui and I have already sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.
At a moment like this, why should we engage in internecine strife?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The decision came very
quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because all of
the monsters present shared the same goal - to go to the greater
world outside. Since they were all sincere in their desires and had
no wish to squabble, the leaders naturally decided to swear oaths to
the Dao of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these loose,
scattered powers were seemingly small and weak, if one added them all
up, they were definitely not any weaker than the ten thousand-plus
Dao-soldiers which Immortal Duohe himself commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witchsui, your
Witchriver clan is a bit stronger than my forces. Let these monsters
stay with me and stand on guard here,” Immortal Duohe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The proud Witchriver
clan disdained from allying with the other monsters. With a teleport,
Immortal Witchsui once more departed, returning to his own Yaksha
Dao-soldier formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
no idea at all that the monsters outside had finally accomplished a
miracle which had not been seen in all the countless years after
Immortal Witchriver’s death…absolute unity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-soldiers which
Immortal Witchriver had left behind consisted of two types; the
‘Seawave Dao-soldiers’ and the ‘Yaksha Dao-soldiers’. The
Seawave Dao-armors were extremely numerous. As for the more elite
Yaksha Dao-armors, he had left them to his own Witchriver clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, under Immortal
Duohe’s command, all of the Seawave Dao-soldiers had been gathered
in one place, forming a power that was no weaker than the Yaksha
Dao-soldier formation! These Seawave Dao-soldiers tightly surrounded
one golden Skypillar of light, while the other Yaksha Dao-soldiers
tightly surrounded the other one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group flew
into the palace. This was an extremely large hall, almost identical
to the Immortal Grass Palace. Within the hall were many, many
corpses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are
Dao-soldier armors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-soldier armors!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group, upon
entering, was immediately stunned by the many corpses on the ground.
And then, they noticed those Dao-armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The Fiendgod
Hydraga once more stretched out his two massive hands. With
inexorable power, he snatched up the the magic treasures around two
corpses that were covered with Dao-armors that were nearly
translucent and which glowed with black light. These two Dao-armors
both emanated incredibly powerful ripples; although they were
inferior to Immortal-ranked magic treasures, they vastly surpassed
the other Dao-armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After collecting these
two Dao-armors and sets of magic treasures, the Fiendgod, Xiangliu
Fang, once more returned to stand on the warship next to Youngflame
Nong, acting as though nothing had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guy…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
completely helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had no time to
waste for words. All of them transformed into streaks of light,
beginning to frantically collect the treasures lying on the ground.
The entire, massive hall had to have at least hundreds of skeletons
littering it, all of which were covered by Dao-armors. These
Dao-armors varied in strength; some were suitable for the Zifu level,
some were suitable for the Wanxiang level, and some were even
suitable for Primals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two that
glowed with black light were probably meant for Loose Immortals or
Earth Immortals to wear,” Ning and the others mused silently to
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning’s group
had completely swept through this entire hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This palace didn’t
have any private rooms; it was just a massive, empty palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. The Fiendgod,
Xiangliu Fang, pointed off into the distance. A black surge of divine
power landed on the distant walls of the palace, and three characters
instantly appeared on the wall - DAO SOLDIER PALACE.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Dao
Soldier Palace,” Youngflame Nong laughed. “However, Immortal
Witchriver had too many Dao-soldiers, so most remained in the outside
world. Only a small number of them remained in here…just now, the
two Dao-armors which Uncle Fang collected can only be considered
top-grade Heaven-ranked treasures; they are far from being at the
level of Immortal-ranked treasures. If they were Immortal-ranked
treasures, then they probably would have manifested
treasure-spirits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
understood that Youngflame Nong was trying to console them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the wide palace,
there were also a series of extremely large pillars. One of them,
covered in decorative carvings of a divine, coiling dragon, was the
core of this palace. Youngflame Nong thus sat down in the lotus
position in front of the pillar, beginning to bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
could do nothing but wait patiently to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, that’s amazing,” Northson said, seated next
to Ning. He chortled, “Just now, each of us only managed to acquire
a few of the treasures from those hundreds of Dao-soldier corpses,
but you, senior apprentice-brother…with two spirit-beasts helping
you, it was as though there were three of you scavenging at the same
time. And that Azure Skysnake in particular…with a blink, she moved
from corpse to corpse at astonishing speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, it had
primarily been Ji Ning’s group, Xue Hongyi, the Whitewater Hound,
and Little Qing who had been scavenging the corpses. Ning, Uncle
White, and Little Qing had thus made up three of the eight
scavengers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. He ended up
with the most Dao-armors as well. Still, I acquired an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure; it’s even better than a thousand or
ten thousand Dao-armors.” The nearby Xue Hongyi mused silently to
himself, but he didn’t dare to say anything aloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, after we go to the next palace, you need
to take it easy,” Adept Vastriver laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? Take it easy?”
Yu Wei laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is your own fault
for not having spirit-beasts.” Ninelotus spoke up in Ning’s
defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver sighed,
“Everyone wants good spirit-beasts. If, for example, a Redscale
Salamander was willing to submit to me, of course I would accept it.
Unfortunately, there’s no way I can even get close to that sort of
Godbeast; as soon as the mere hint of one appears, supremely powerful
clans like the Youngflame clan will immediately capture it. Even your
Azure Skysnake, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning…Azure Skysnakes
are extremely skilled at finding treasures and fortuitous legacies.
They are extremely rare and hard to find; to take in one as a
spirit-beast is quite hard as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake,
come, take me as your master,” Northson called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woody, you
blockhead, you think you are worthy of being my master?” Little
Qing, coiled around Ning’s arm, raised her serpentine head and
spoke out in the human tongue, clearly filled with disdain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, you Azure
Skysnake, I’m still your master’s brother, you know!” Northson
stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only acknowledge
my master. You? Go sit in the corner somewhere,” Little Qing said
with tremendous arrogance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” Northson,
utterly infuriated, was only able to let out a snort. “You know
what? I’m not going to squabble with a little snake like you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never been able
to win a verbal victory over Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, watching this,
began to laugh. Actually, the likes of Yu Wei and Adept Vastriver,
both reincarnated Immortals, trained at extremely rapid rates. Thus,
they generally would not acquire spirit-beasts, because their
spirit-beasts wouldn’t possibly be able to keep up with them! As
for some truly powerful Godbeasts…they weren’t so easily
acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
Redscale Salamander; everyone wanted them, but they weren’t so
easily acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Azure
Skysnake was a bit weaker in power, it was still extremely talented
in seeking out fortuitous legacies and treasures; generally speaking,
Immortal cultivators would all be willing to tame one. Unfortunately,
they were too rare, and also very skilled in escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Whitewater
Hounds? By comparison, they were actually a bit inferior. Their
strengths mainly lay in their intelligence and their comprehensive
abilities. Still, to Ning, the Whitewater Hound was his Uncle White,
like a parent or an elder in the family. He had also once saved both
Ning and Ning’s mother, and had always quietly supported Ning in
his endeavors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it had to be
said that Uncle White was indeed quite accomplished in the art of
formations; he had been the main problem-solver in the Vault of
Treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong rose to
his feet. He had already bound the core of this palace, but there
wasn’t a hint of joy on his face. Ning and the others weren’t
smiling either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…they
had now completely bound three of the palaces; the Vault of
Treasures, the Immortal Grass Palace, and the Dao Soldier Palace. Two
more palaces remained…and one was under heavy guard by the Yaksha
Dao-soldiers, while the other was under heavy guard by the Seawave
Dao-soldiers. If they wanted to enter, they would have to fight.
There would be no way to avoid them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those terrifying
monstrous Dao-soldiers were so powerful that they had beaten even a
Fiendgod like Xiangliu Fang into a constant retreat. If Ning and the
others were to engage them in battle, they would probably be
effortlessly slaughtered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Compared to Xiangliu
Fang, they were in a position of extreme weakness, to say nothing of
those Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The threat of imminent
death…it caused all of them to have ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.”
Youngflame Nong swept Ning and the others with his gaze. “I have
the key to the estate, and can open a corridor to leave from any
location within this Immortal estate. If we truly encounter a great
danger that we simply cannot withstand…I’ll lead you all in
fleeing this Immortal estate. Don’t worry; I’m still confident in
my abilities to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, everyone,
you need to be very careful; I don’t wish for any of you to end up
being killed by the monsters,” Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
understood that there was no way out now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, none of them
had thought that challenging a Celestial Immortal’s estate would be
an easy task. Danger was expected and normal. Ning and the others all
had their own life-saving measures, none of which had been used yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very good. Let’s
head out,” Youngflame Nong ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the monsters of
this Immortal estate world had been divided into two forces. One was
the Witchriver clan’s Yaksha Dao-soldiers, while the other was the
Seawave Dao-soldiers. They were each guarding one of the palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In air, far away, a
large warship suddenly appeared. Waves of energy rippled out from it
as it cruised forward, flying through the air at high speed and
heading directly towards the Seawave Dao-soldiers, led by Immortal
Duohe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Fiendgod and
those humans are coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Duohe, it’s up to
you,” Immortal Witchsui sent mentally from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Duohe had more
than twenty thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers under his command. They
formed into an incomparably titanic wave that covered the skies, and
all of them stared coldly towards the large warship flying towards
them.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
stared at the massive, distant wave, and the savage, sky-filling aura
the wave emanated. All of them had heavy feelings in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These monsters…after
I bind the Immortal estate, I am going to enslave all of them. All of
them!” Youngflame Nong stared at the distant monsters, his face
turning savage. He also gritted his teeth, then produced in his hand
a queer contraption that was the size of a person’s head.
Extraordinarily powerful ripples emerged from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t help but look at this item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Wildcore?” Mu
Northson called out in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
including Adept Vastriver, Ninelotus, and Xue Hongyi, all had puzzled
looks on their faces. Clearly, they had no idea what this was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually know
about Wildcores?” Youngflame Nong nodded. “Right. This is a
Wildcore! An Immortal-grade Wildcore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But your
construct-warship is only at the Heaven-rank. If you put this
Immortal-grade Wildcore into this construct-warship, it won’t be
able to withstand the power. Even if it looks perfectly fine from the
outside, the formation diagrams inside it will begin to crumble. Your
construct-warship will be doomed.” Northson couldn’t help but
voice his concerns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be able to
hold for a short period of time, the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea,” Youngflame Nong said calmly. He then immediately pressed the
head-sized Wildcore towards the planks of the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dark corridor
naturally appeared in the floorboards of the warship, and the
Wildcore burrowed within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For at least that
period of time, this warship of mine will be able to reach a level
that approaches the Immortal-rank. Perhaps it wouldn’t be able to
withstand the attacks of Celestial Immortals, but these monstrous
Dao-soldiers won’t be able to break my warship,” Youngflame Nong
said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s a
Wildcore?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, what sort of a thing is this Desolate Heart?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
puzzled, all sent mental messages to Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was extremely
skilled in the Dao of Constructs, and he also understood Wildcores
very well. He immediately sent back, “It’s quite complicated, but
to simplify it…Wildcores are, in reality, meant to be used for
Immortal-ranked construct-warships, allowing them to temporarily
explode with power. Immortal-ranked construct-warships are able to
withstand this sort of sudden increase in power…but Immortal-ranked
warships are far more valuable than even ordinary Immortal-ranked
magic treasures. Even young master Youngflame most likely doesn’t
possess this sort of warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, Youngflame
Nong is placing his Wildcore into the warship he is using. His
warship is actually very good as well; it is Heaven-ranked, and a
very precious one. But the power of a Wildcore is simply too great,
and this Heaven-ranked construct-warship cannot endure it. Even
though its own ‘body’, being a magic treasure, won’t be
damaged, the formations and diagrams within it will begin to
crumble,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning and the
others understood little of this craft, they understood the
importance of formation-diagrams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation-diagrams
of a construct served as their core; they were what made the
constructs work properly! It was precisely because of the existence
of formation-diagrams that constructs were able to possess sentience
and unleash powerful, precise attacks. Once the formation-diagrams
crumbled, the entire construct would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One warship, one
Wildcore,” Youngflame Nong growled. “We have to enter this
palace. We have to!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged glances. They could all sense Youngflame Nong’s resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship steadily
moved forward. Immortal Duohe, in command of more than twenty
thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers, stared coldly as it approached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill that Fiendgod.
Kill those humans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These monstrous
Dao-soldiers were all eager and impatient. However, without Immortal
Duohe’s order, nobody dared to attack rashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seemingly placid
and calm warship, that had been advancing at an ordinary speed,
suddenly began to glow with an dazzlingly brilliant golden light. Its
aura vastly increased, and a golden halo suddenly covered the entire
warship as it became criss-crossed with lines of power. It seemed to
have transformed into a long awl, shuttling through the air at an
incomparably astonishing speed towards the massive, sky-filling
Seawave Dao-soldier formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too fast! The
warship’s sudden explosion of speed made it move lightning-fast,
catching the Seawave Dao-soldiers off-guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Immortal
Duohe’s already-gravelly voice suddenly rang out in the minds of
every single Dao-soldier. All of them activated their elemental ki
into their Dao-armors, and an enormous, endless amount of elemental
ki passed through their armors as more than twenty thousand monstrous
Dao-soldiers merged powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Immortal Duohe,
he was the ‘head’ of this massive Seawave Dao-soldier formation.
How to attack and how to defend…it was all up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Immortal Duohe howled. The massive wave came smashing down towards
the lightning-face warship. BOOM! The wave heavily struck the warship
head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden aura
surrounding the warship, however, just trembled once, then regained
it’s perfect stability. However, the collisive power was simply too
great, causing the warship to be knocked backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t charge
them head-on,” Northson shouted hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
standing within the warship, were incomparably stable. All of them
had solemn looks on their faces, and their raised their heads to
stare at the massive wave which came crashing down upon them once
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, go,”
Youngflame Nong said, gritting his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Xiangliu
Fang let out a growling response, and each of his hands became filled
with a long awl that emanating an astonishing aura. And then….swoosh!
He passed straight through the outer layer of golden light
surrounding the warship. The golden light didn’t impede him at all,
allowing Xiangliu Fang to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monsters, f*ck off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang, having
transformed into his true form of a three thousand meter tall,
nine-headed, serpent-bodied Hydraga, went forward to clash with the
massive, sky-filling wave. He began to launch his attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, his awls were
also three thousand meters long. They struck out like the galloping
thunder or the dancing lightning, stabbing directly into the wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny Fiendgod, don’t
even think of affecting us.” Immortal Duohe’s voice boomed out,
and the massive, savage wave sent out another surge of power,
smashing directly against the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skin tore open, and
flesh split apart. Blood flew everywhere. One of the long awls was
knocked flying, while Xiangliu Fang himself was sent hurtling through
the air as well. Last time, although he was capable of fighting
against Immortal Duohe’s monstrous Dao-soldiers, there had only
been ten thousand of them. This time, Immortal Duohe had unified all
of the other smaller powers, forming a Seawave Dao-soldier formation
of more than twenty thousand monsters. The power had increased
several times over, causing even Xiangliu Fang to be completely
unable to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Xiangliu
Fang’s hands stretched out, transforming into countless giant
snakes and latching onto the discarded awl. The injuries on his body
rapidly healed, and he once more fearlessly charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clashes between the
Fiendgod and the wave contained enough power to shock the heavens and
shake the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Fiendgod,
Xiangliu Fang, was in a position of absolute inferiority, he still
managed to divert a large part of the power of the Seawave
Dao-soldiers. For a moment, the warship, seeming incomparably tiny in
the face of this vast wave, was able to once more advance at high
speed, seizing the chance to hurtle forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Detestable.”
Immortal Duohe was frantic as well. If he had to deal with Xiangliu
Fang, it was hard to avoid the warship from advancing through
openings in their defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no idea how this
warship could have suddenly grown so powerful; despite the power of
the waves and the collisive force of the blows, they still weren’t
able to force the warship back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhenbao, you come
and lead my tribe,” Immortal Duohe sent mentally. “We will divide
into two Seawave Dao-soldier formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhenbao was the
disciple which Immortal Duohe trusted the most, and was second only
to him in power. He was already a peak Primal, and was extremely
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divide!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive wave in the
air instantly split apart, dividing into two. The Seawave Dao-soldier
formation personally commanded by Immortal Duohe, formed from many
merged lesser monstrous tribes, went to block the Fiendgod, Xiangliu
Fang. As for the other ten thousand Dao-soldiers, they were led by
Daoist Zhenbao to block the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
within the warship, watched as the massive Fiendgod battled with the
giant wave. The warship continued to advance forward at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, it is
capable of stopping Uncle Fang, but not me.” Youngflame Nong’s
eyes were filled with madness. “Keep charging. Charge to the edges
of the palace, and I’ll be able to enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around them were
countless waves, but the warship continued to charge forward with
inexorable power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive wave
suddenly split apart, forming into two waves. One completely focused
on stopping the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, and completely tied him
down. The other, seemingly slightly weaker, was completely focused on
guarding against the encroaching warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The advance of the
warship instantly grew much more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They separated?”
Youngflame Nong ground his teeth. “Charge, charge, charge!
Wildcore, blaze for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The light on the
surface of the warship suddenly skyrocketed in luminosity, and its
charging power grew even more ferocious. The ten thousand monstrous
Dao-soldiers commanded by Daoist Zhenbao were completely capable of
suppressing Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals, but in the face of
this explosively powerful warship, they actually weren’t able to
tie it down, and the warship continued to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop it, Zhenbao,
stop it, stop it!” Immortal Duohe hurriedly sent a mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
master, leave it to me!” Daoist Zhenbao was going crazy as well.
His entire wave suddenly grew even more savage, transforming into a
bloody color. As for the warship, it too advanced forward at a
berserk speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster, faster,
faster.” Youngflame Nong gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dangerous. This is
dangerous. This is way too dangerous.” Northson’s eyelids were
twitching as he watched. He hurriedly sent a mental message to Ning
and the others, “Senior fellow disciples, be careful. Youngflame
Nong has gone utterly mad. This Heaven-ranked construct-warship was
unable to withstand the Wildcore to begin with, and now he’s
burning its power like mad, causing its power to explode even more in
a short period of time. The formation-diagrams within this
Heaven-ranked warship can collapse at any moment. Once it does, the
warship will be finished, and we’ll have to suffer the attacks from
these ten thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers head on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yu Wei, Adept
Vastriver, and the others all began to feel nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge, charge,
charge!” Youngflame Nong’s face was completely red, and madness
was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madman. He’s a
madman.” Xue Hongyi, seeing this, felt panic in his heart. In front
of the warship was that terrifying Seawave Dao-soldier formation; it
was capable of splitting the skin and rending the flesh of even a
Fiendgod like Xiangliu Fang. If the warship was destroyed and the
wave slammed against them, it would probably break them all into tiny
pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack crack crack…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the entire
warship began to emanate sounds. Its charging speed began to lessen,
and the aura of golden light around it began to grow unstable,
starting to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s breaking.
It’s breaking!” Northson immediately called out, “Young master
Youngflame!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daoist Zhenbao,
who was in command of the ten thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers, he
naturally noticed that the speed of the warship he was in charge of
dealing with was beginning to lesson, and that the golden light
surrounding it was weakening. He immediately was overjoyed, and he
bellowed out, “Kill them! Kill them all and seize the key!”
Instantly, an even more terrifying wave-crest formed, smashing down
viciously towards the warship!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Adept
Vastriver, Yu Wei, Ninelotus, Mu Northson, and Xue Hongyi were all
incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Yu Wei, a dim
spot of light appeared in her forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s elemental ki
had already seeped into his storage-type magic treasure. Within it,
there was a green leaf that was covered with gray runes, causing it
to appear unfathomably mysterious This was one of the two life-saving
treasures which Ning had acquired within the underwater estate, the
one meant for defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ninelotus
clenched her fist as well, and the skin on her arm began to vaguely
emanate with white lotus flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
preparing to activate their life-saving treasures at a moment’s
notice. They stared towards the warship nervously, watching the
shuddering, fluctuating golden barrier of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive, savage wave
viciously struck against the barrier of light. The warship flipped
over, but then continued to charge forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite the warship
flipping over, Ning and the others all stood firmly on the floor of
the warship, as though rooted to it. Their eyes couldn’t help but
suddenly widen as they all stared at the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack crack rack….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of shuddering
cracks rang out from inside the warship, the golden barrier of light
began to dim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AAAAARGH! Damn you,
damn you, DAMN YOU!” Youngflame Nong let out a throat-rending howl.
A rolled paper scroll suddenly appeared within his hand. The scroll
seemed quite ordinary; although paper was relatively rare in the Ji
clan’s territory, in Stillwater City, it was still quite common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This seemingly ordinary
scroll, however, had a single, large character written atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LOCK!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lock!” The gazes
of Ning and everyone else were completely captivated by the ‘lock’
character on the paper scroll. It was an extremely simple character,
but it emanated with the aura of a vast Dao, far broader and wider
than the Dao of Rainwater and the Dao of the Inferno which Ning
normally meditated on. In fact, Ning even felt a desire to submit and
kowtow towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘lock’
character atop the scroll suddenly began to glow with light. It
emanated a blurry radiance which spread out to the sourrounding area,
and the surrounding Seawave Dao-soldiers were caught by it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…the
wind halted. The water halted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
world had frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
however, were completely unaffected. All of them couldn’t help but
feel astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, what, what was
that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait. Those Seawave
Dao-soldiers are still moving, only…they are moving extremely
slow.” Ning’s group immediately realized that the massive,
surrounding wave hadn’t actually frozen; it was just advancing at
an extremely slow pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without the Seawave
Dao-soldiers blocking the way, the warship instantly traversed the
final ten kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open!” The
ashen-faced Youngflame Nong activated the key, and an illusory palace
door instantly appeared in front of him. The warship immediately flew
into the illusory gate, and then the gate swung shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Youngflame Nong and
the others entered the illusory gate, the massive wave, which had
seemed to be almost frozen in place, suddenly came crashing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can…how can
that have happened?” The leader of the Seawave Dao-soldiers, Daoist
Zhenbao, stared in disbelief at the distant, already-shut palace
door. “Just now, just then…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would never forget
that feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He clearly had already
unleashed the full power of the Seawave Dao-soldiers, and had been
attacking at high speed, but…how could the enemy warship have
suddenly increased in speed by ten thousand times or a hundred
thousand times? It was precisely because the enemy’s speed had
suddenly increased by an utterly ridiculous amount that he had been
unable to control the wave and unleash an attack. Thus, the enemy had
passed straight through his Dao-soldiers and entered the illusory
palace gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, they…how
did they suddenly move so fast? I was completely unable to block
them,” Daoist Zhenbao sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Immortal
Duohe, who had been dealing with Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang in the
distance, had actually been paying attention to the battle over here
as well. After all, the humans aboard the warship were what mattered
the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had been
completely stupefied as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t that
they were fast; it was that you were slow,” Immortal Duohe sent
mentally. “All of the Dao-soldiers, in that instant, seemed to be
crawling even slower than a baby turtle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can that be? I
didn’t feel as though my speed lessened, and none of the
Dao-soldiers under my command felt that their speed had lessened,”
Daoist Zhenbao said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s
because…time changed for you. You should have heard the saying, ‘a
day in the Deva realm, a year in the mortal realms’, right? This is
because time passes at different rates in the Deva realm and in the
mortal realms. Perhaps in the Deva realm, you might only feel as
though a day had passed, but in the mortal realm, a year might have
passed. This is exactly what happened just now. You felt as though
just an instant had passed, but in reality, an extremely long period
of time had passed, and the enemy warship flew more than ten
kilometers away.” A hint of despair was in Immortal Duohe’s eyes.
“These humans were actually able to produce such a treasure…can
it be that the Heavens themselves wish to destroy those of us in this
Immortal estate world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Zhenbao now
understood as well. So it was time. Time had changed for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though an
instant had passed for him, but thousands of years had passed for
them; when time flowed at completely different rates, what happened
just now would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually a
treasure like this…” Daoist Zhenbao murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…you aren’t
capable of stopping my young master. You aren’t capable of it!”
The distant Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang, had already begun to flee. As he
did so, his laughter echoed out in the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seawave
Dao-soldiers were completely unable to catch him with their attacks.
When Xiangliu Fang completely focused on running away, they weren’t
able to catch up to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, all of
us.” Immortal Duohe had the appearance of a middle-aged man, but in
that instant, he seemed to have aged significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Seawave
Dao-soldier formations reformed into one, and the massive seawave
flew at high speed towards the distant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short period of time
later, the massive Seawave Dao-soldiers reunited with the Yaksha
Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually failed?
Failed?!” Immortal Witchsui sent a mental message over, and the
other members of the Witchriver clan looked at them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failed.” Immortal
Duohe said hoarsely, “These humans actually held an inconceivably
powerful treasure.” Earlier, the two sides had been separated by
ten thousand kilometers, and so the Witchriver clan hadn’t been
able to clearly watch the exchange of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
treasure was it, for it to be able to break through your defense?”
Immortal Witchsui asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure capable
of affecting time itself,” Immortal Duohe said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time?” Immortal
Witchsui was shocked as well. He was, after all, of the Witchriver
clan; he knew some secrets. Generally speaking, it was fairly common
for Celestial Immortals to encounter treasures that affected time
itself. For Celestial Immortals, it was a common type of attack. But
it was rare for even even one out of ten thousand Earth Immortals to
become a Celestial Immortal…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Treasures capable of
influencing the flow of time, to Loose Immortals, were incomparably
powerful. The Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals of the outside
world might have witnessed such treasures before, but these two Loose
Immortals of the Immortal estate world had only heard of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Immortal Witchsui sent mentally. “It is already incredible that the
human had even one such treasure. I refuse to believe he has a second
one.” Immortal Duohe nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Duohe, we have no
way out now. This is the last palace. We have to guard it! This is
our last chance to acquire the key to the Immortal estate,”
Immortal Witchsui said. “The dream which those of us within the
Immortal estate have held for countless generations…this is our
very last chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just our last
chance at leaving,” Immortal Duohe said hoarsely. “Our last
chance at survival as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survival?”
Immortal Witchsui was startled…and then, his face turned completely
pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone capable of
having a treasure like this, and having a Fiendgod serve as a
guard…these humans definitely have an extraordinary background.”
Immortal Duohe’s voice echoed out in the minds of every single
Dao-soldier. He slowly said something which caused terror in every
single monstrous Dao-soldier’s heart. “After he completely binds
this final palace, then he will be in complete control fo the entire
Immortal estate. By then, he can do whatever he wants to us;
everything will be under his control. He can also summon an army from
the outside world, or he can also destroy the environment of this
Immortal estate world, causing our descendants to not even have
anything to eat or drink, starving them to death. In short…if he
binds this Immortal estate, he will have countless tools at his
disposal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the monsters
were terrified. Right. If the enemy was to control the Immortal
estate, he could launch sneak attacks from anywhere in the estate. If
he were to toss out some powerful, deadly poisons…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would be too simple
to destroy an area of mere tens of thousands of kilometers. Some
terrifyingly powerful poisons were capable of causing an area of tens
of thousands of kilometers to be completely poisoned, where not even
a blade of grass would grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creation was hard.
Destruction was easy. After destroying the environment of this
Immortal world, a few tens of thousands of years later, most likely
almost no one would be left alive within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our last
hope.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our last
chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to seize the
key to the Immortal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if all of us
die, we cannot let them bind this final palace!!!” Immortal Duohe’s
voice rang out in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FIGHT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the monsters
howled in anger. All of them brimmed with eagerness for battle. This
was no longer a battle for freedom; it was a true battle for
survival!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship had charged
in, and as soon as it did, the golden glow around it completely
vanished. The mysterious, powerful aura that had previously permeated
the warship was completely gone; it seemed completely inert and
lifeless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The
formation-diagrams finally collapsed.” Northson shook his head.
“Towards the end, the warship was just flying forward on momentum.
A Heaven-ranked construct-warship, just like that, was destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven-ranked
construct-warship was nothing.” Adept Vastriver shook his head,
gesturing with his eyes. “Take a look at young master Youngflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
noticed as well. Youngflame Nong was currently clutching that paper
scroll, staring fixedly at the ‘lock’ character atop it. Alas,
the ‘lock’ character now seemed completely ordinary. There was
nothing special about it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One Instant, A
Thousand Years,” Yu Wei said softly. “This sort of treasure, when
used, can virtually guarantee the death of a Loose Immortal. Although
this sort of treasure isn’t Immortal-ranked, it isn’t too far
from it in value.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were puzzled. The nearby Ninelotus, seeing the look on Ning’s face,
sent mentally to him, “One Instant, A Thousand Years - this name
symbolizes the ability of this sort of treasure to affect the rate of
time. For you, it might feel as though an instant had passed, but for
the enemy, more than a thousand years would have passed. But of
course, that’s only an extremely, overly extravagant description.
In short, when the rate of time is flowing at very different speeds,
a Primal Daoist is capable of killing a Loose Immortal. From this,
you can tell how precious this treasure is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, when he had
been received the [Starseizing Hand] transmission in the transmission
space of the underwater estate, he had spent months within, but time
in the outside world had barely moved. This was indeed far more
incredible than a mere scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn.”
Youngflame Nong stared at the scroll in his hand, grinding his teeth.

Chapter 18 - The Dao Repository of the Ji Clan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
look on young master Youngflame’s face, he must be about to go
crazy from grief.” Mu Northson’s mental voice had a hint of
schadenfreude to it. This exalted young master had taken one one
powerful treasure after another. How could Ji Ning, Northson, Xue
Hongyi, and the others not feel powerless before them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood
that they were nothing more than geniuses of Stillwater
Commandery…while the man before them was very likely going to be
the next Godplume Duke! Someone who was even more exalted than the
Marquis of Stillwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though he was just
the heir to the position, the treasures he possessed were enough to
cause Ning and the others to constantly sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The monsters of this
Immortal estate…I won’t spare any of them.” Youngflame Nong
ground his teeth. To charge into this fourth palace, he had to use up
his Heaven-ranked construct-warship, a Wildcore, and his ‘Lock’
scroll; psychologically, he had been completely unprepared to have to
use up all three treasures. And this was just the fourth palace; by
now the Seawave Dao-soldiers and the Yaksha Dao-soldiers had surely
assembled outside the fifth and final palace. The cost for them to
enter that fifth palace would definitely be incomparably astonishing.
Just thinking about it made young master Youngflame feel miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am definitely
going to enslave them all, then sell them offer to various tribes.
Their descendants will forever be slaves,” Youngflame Nong said
with a hate-filled voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.” Xue Hongyi spoke out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes?” Young master
Youngflame looked at him. “What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi immediately
smiled and said, “Young master, are you worrying about entering the
fifth palace? As I see it, actually, there’s no need to fight
head-on against them. These monsters just want to leave this Immortal
estate world, right? Young master, you can promise to let them leave.
I imagine that these monsters would be willing to accept. Each of you
can set an oath to the Dao of the Heavens, which they wouldn’t dare
violate. In this way, young master, you would be able to enter the
fifth palace without using up any treasures. What do you think, young
master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi thought that
his idea was a good one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Youngflame
gave him a cold glance. Between grinding teeth, he spoke out two
words: “You imbecile!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young…” Xue
Hongyi’s face instantly turned red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Being a genius of
cultivation didn’t necessarily mean that one was intelligent in
handling worldly affairs. Still, Xue Hongyi was still quite
intelligent; upon being rebuked as young master Youngflame as an
‘imbecile’, although he felt incredibly insulted, he then
immediately understood what Youngflame Nong was thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, standing
next to Ning, sent a mental laugh to him. “This Xue Hongyi really
is an imbecile. Since young master Youngflame has elected to come to
this estate, he most likely has already prepared for all
contingenices. As far as he is concerned, if he can bind this estate,
then all of the monsters within can be toyed with as he pleases; they
wouldn’t even be able to escape. Tens of thousands of
monster-slaves, and all of which are Dao-soldiers as well! There are
even precious Yaksha Dao-soldiers here…only Celestial Immortals
could afford to be so extravagant. Once he offers these Dao-soldiers
to his clan, not only will he be able to make up for his losses, he
will be rewarded richly! To negotiate with the monsters and to let
them leave…isn’t this the same as letting an enormous fortune
just walk away?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded his head.
The vast number of Seawave Dao-armors and Yaksha Dao-armors alone was
an inestimable fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This palace actually
doesn’t even have a single golem within, nor are there any
attacking formations.” Youngflame Nong no longer focused on his
losses, instead carefully inspecting the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” He suddenly
waved his hand, and a bubbling, boiling black strand of elemental ki
spread out in every direction, striking against the walls of the
palace. Rumble, rumble, rumble. The palace walls were incomparably
sturdy, but under the assault of the elemental ki, three words
suddenly appeared on the palace wall in front of them: DAO REPOSITORY
PALACE.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Repository
Palace?” The eyes of Ning and everyone else lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single power
needed to build a Dao Repository. Even the Ji clan of West Prefecture
City had its own vault that was used for hiding sutras and scripts
for its descendants to learn from. The Black-White College had its
own Dao Repository as well. Immortal Witchriver had his own forces;
although his roots weren’t as deep and his history wasn’t as old
as the Black-White College, he vastly surpassed the likes of
Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without even waiting
for Youngflame Nong to say anything, Ning and the others transformed
into streaks of light, charging towards a corridor right next to the
three characters, ‘DAO REPOSITORY PALACE’. The reason they all
charged towards this corridor was because this was the only corridor
there was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These guys…”
With a swooshing sound, Youngflame Nong charged forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon charging into the
corridor, what greeted them was a massive, vast hall. The insides of
this hall were filled with countless books, a veritable sea of them,
most likely not much smaller than the Dao Repository of the
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, take them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them seemed to
have been possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single power
cared deeply about its techniques and secret arts. If they were to
find any which the Black-White College was not in possession of and
offer it to them, they would be able to acquire enormous sums of
black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Ning
waved his hand, and a large number of books in front of him were
immediately collected in into his storage-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Azure
Skysnake, she blinked from place to place, calling out in
celebration, “C’mere, all of ya!” The books beneath her all
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” The
Whitewater Hound collected the books before him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi had gone
crazy as well. Everyone, including the final person to enter,
Youngflame Nong, began to quickly collect the books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this giant
hall had a massive number of books, in just a few moments, the entire
hall had been completely emptied out. In the end, they didn’t even
spare the shelves used to carry the books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at how crazy
all of you have gotten.” Youngflame Nong shook his head. “I hope
these aren’t just the abridged versions. All of you will be
stupefied if they are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
knew this as well. It was very likely that the books here were simple
abridged versions…but no one wanted to take the risk that they
weren’t. After all, it would take some time to ascertain if a book
was an abridged version or not, and in the time it took, everyone
else would have seized all the other books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a
look.” Ning and the others started to take out one book after
another, perusing through them carefully. Moments later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Abridged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is
abridged; it just has the very first part of the technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is abridged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is also
abridged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one isn’t
abridged, it is complete, but it is actually the most commonly seen
formation technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
instantly downfallen; nearly ninety percent of the books were
abridged, and as for the complete versions? They were commonly known
commodies; in the Black-White College, one didn’t even have to use
black-white pellets to trade for them. Almost all larger schools had
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The books with more
valuable techniques, secret arts, and divine abilities…were all
abridged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost all of these
are abridged,” Ning mused to himself. “But there should
definitely a place where the full versions are located. The full
versions should be located in a more hidden area. I refuse to believe
that Immortal Witchriver carried all of those books with him. Can it
be that his clansmen wouldn’t need to train while he was wandering
and adventuring?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh1 Ning
immediately scurried towards one of the four corridors leading away
from the massive hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t just Ning
who had come to this conclusion; the others had as well. There had to
be complete versions somewhere! And that place was most likely
hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Youngflame
Nong, by relying on the affinity from the key to the estate, moved
into one corridor, quickly discovering a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here it is.”
Youngflame Nong entered the room, immediately seeing the skeleton
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This skeleton was the
guardian of the Dao Repository Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.”
Youngflame Nong collected the skeleton, and then turned his gaze
towards a stone book. His key was telling him…that this stone book
was the core for the entire Dao Repository Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind.” Youngflame
Nong just bound a small part of it, then came to a halt. He only
needed to bind a small part of it to ensure that all of the
formations and restrictive spells within the Dao Repository Palace
would be deactivated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Youngflame
Nong quickly left the room, beginning to search as well. If he were
to locate a powerful divine ability or secret art which the
Youngflame clan didn’t already possess, he would be rendering a
major merit. However, given how ancient and powerful the Youngflame
clan was…it was very, very hard to discover secret arts or divine
abilities they didn’t already have.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
had been activated long ago, filling every single part of the hall he
was in. However, since the walls of the Immortal estate blocked out
divine sense, he wasn’t able to search deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, quick,
come over here!” Uncle White suddenly sent him a mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, just about to
push open a stone door and investigate, suddenly came to a halt. He
transformed into a streak of light, hurrying towards Uncle White’s
direction. Just a few seconds later, he entered a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room, there were rows of books, all of which were protected by
restrictive spells. However, these restrictive spells were all
inactive, and the Whitewater Hound, Xue Hongyi, and Adept Vastriver
were frantically seizing them.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no time to
waste. He began to frantically start collecting books. Actually, as
soon as he entered the room and saw the books and bookshelves, Ning
felt quite certain that they should all be complete versions. This
was because generally speaking, complete versions of techniques would
span up to ten full volumes. Abridged versions, in turn, might take
up just a thin book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…and this. And
this!” Ning was frantically collecting books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the entire room was completely empty. The final person to arrive,
young master Youngflame, was only able to collect a few books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all full
versions.” Ning and the others began to look through the books they
had acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Just
Earth-ranked techniques?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is
Mortal-ranked?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These ‘secret
arts’ are too ordinary.” Ning and the others began to frown as
they looked. They were all geniuses, and in the Black-White College,
they chose from Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques. However, the
books they had found here were all Mortal-ranked and Earth-ranked
techniques and secret arts. Although the books were extremely
numerous, there wasn’t even a single Heaven-ranked technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Youngflame clan
has plenty of this sort of crap. There isn’t even a single useful
book here.” Youngflame Nong furrowed his brows, shaking his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
laughed. Right. These books were useless to him, but they would be
very useful to the Ji clan. The Ji clan had far, far too few
techniques and secret arts, and those they had, he had purchased from
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. But how many could he possibly buy,
on his own? To accumulate a large number of secret arts and
techniques, generally speaking, the only way was annihilate another
large clan and seize their books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than a million
techniques and secret arts. Although they aren’t that good, they
are enough for Xiantian lifeforms and Zifu Disciples to use,” Ning
mused to himself. “In the future, after I find some top-tier Ki
Refining techniques, my Ji clan will be able to set up a Dao
Repository of its own to pass down to later generations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Repositories were
the heart of any tribe, sect, or school. Each generation relied on
their Dao Repositories to grow strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Witchriver
was a Celestial Immortal; he definitely must have more powerful
techniques and divine abilities. But where are they?” Youngflame
Nong frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most powerful
techniques and divine abilities must be stored in extremely
well-hidden places. They might not even be in this Dao Repository
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
just pondered briefly, and then…swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! They all
scattered in different directions, searching for treasures. Although
this Dao Repository Vault didn’t necessarily have any top-tier
techniques, secret arts, or divine abilities, perhaps it did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong once
more returned to that earlier room. He sat down in the lotus position
in front of the stone book, beginning to once more bind the core of
this Dao Repository Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I bind it, I’ll
be in complete control of this entire Dao Repository Palace. No
matter how well-hidden a room is, I’ll know about it,” Youngflame
Nong mused to himself. “I need roughly two hours to bind it. Given
how well-hidden the top-tier secret arts and divine abilities must
be, they might not be able to find them within two hours.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top-tier
techniques, divine abilities, and secrets arts. They are going to be
mine, all mine!” Xue Hongyi was rapidly checking one room after
another, his eyes filled with an endless frenzy. He came from
Snowdragon Mountain, which currently didn’t even have a single
Loose Immortal; even if it did occasionally produce a Loose Immortal
or Earth Immortal throughout its long history, there was no way those
figures could compare to a Celestial Immortal like Immortal
Witchriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine abilities
and secret arts left behind by a Celestial Immortal would definitely
be extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one’s level of
power was very close to another’s, the deciding factor were divine
abilities and secret arts. This was especially true for geniuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a chance. A
tremendous chance. I have to find it. With powerful secret arts, in
this life, I might be able to overcome the Celestial tribulation.”
Adept Vastriver was filled with endless desire as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was searching.
Ji Ning, the Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing had separated as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is it? Where
could it be?” A little azure serpent was slithering forward like a
streak of light, occasionally disappearing into thin air and
reappearing somewhere else, and at other times moving directly into a
room without even pushing the stone door open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For me, finding
fortunes is as easy as eating rice, but in this Immortal estate, I’ve
gotten fewer treasures than even Uncle White.” The Azure Skysnake
used her Void Blink technique repeatedly, and even blinked from one
end of a hallway to the other to save time, or directly into rooms.
She wildly teleported about with abandon, trying to find something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another Void Blink.
The Azure Skysnake appeared within a new room. “Nothing here eith…”
The Azure Skysnake suddenly came to a halt. “Eeee?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
looked about this room in surprise. This was a very ordinary room. It
wasn’t very large, and it only held two bookcases and a single
table. The bookcase was covered with a few books, while the number of
books on the table was even more pitifully low. The total number of
books in this entire room was very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that training tomes for Immortal cultivators were extremely massive
and complicated; a single set might comprise of dozens of books. For
example, when Ji Ning had received the transmission of the
[Starseizing Hand] divine ability, it had been directly transferred
to his soul, and had taken several months. From this, one could tell
how massive the amount of information was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
couldn’t help but transform into an azure-robed maiden. She lowered
her head to glance at the books, and as she did, her gaze narrowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, master,
quick, come quick!!!” Little Qing hurriedly shouted through their
spirit-link.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wha..? Coming!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, located in
another region, spread out his divine sense, searching through the
various corridors. Given that he could mentally sense where Little
Qing was located, he quickly found a route to her. As he did, he felt
extremely surprised. “Little Qing actually ran to this place? This
place really is rather unassuming and out of the way. How long would
it have taken to find such a tiny little study?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
transformed into a streak of smoke, rapidly advancing forward and
soon arriving outside the room. He pushed the door open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Upon
entering, Ning saw that the room was completely empty. There was
nothing there, aside from Little Qing, who stood there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I collected it all,”
Little Qing said excitedly. “I didn’t dare leave them here, for
fear that others might take them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What techniques did
you discover? Why are you so careful?” Ning began to grow excited
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing said in a
lowered whisper, “Six types of Immortal-ranked Ki Refining
techniques, totaling more than three hundred volumes. Three types of
divine abilities, totalling more than a hundred volumes. One divine
will technique, totaling six volumes. All of them are complete!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
turned completely round.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal-ranked Ki
Refining techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine abilities?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A divine will
technique?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This…this was truly,
truly priceless. Even in the Black-White College, it would number
amongst their top-tier materials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This room was
actually filled with Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques, divine
abilities, and divine will techniques.” Ning quickly understood.
“Previously, we only discovered Mortal-ranked and Earth-ranked
techniques and what not…I imagine that another room was used to
store Heaven-ranked techniques and arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mortal, Earth, Heaven,
Immortal - the higher the rank was, the more precious the technique
was. Now that he had acquired the Immortal-ranked Ki Refining
techniques, divine abilities, and a divine will technique, Ning was
no longer too interested in those Heaven-ranked techniques and arts.
It’d be nice if he could get them, but it wouldn’t matter if he
didn’t.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, they are all
over here.” Little Qing waved her hand, and a pile of books
instantly appeared in front of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was so terrified
that he instantly waved his hand, collecting them into his own
storage-type magic treasure. He actually began to sweat from fear.
“How could you just take them out?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s better to
leave them with you. I’m not a Fiendgod Body Refiner; those divine
abilities are useless to me. I already have top-tier Ki Refining
techniques of my own as well. Right…later, I’ll give that divine
will technique a try,” Little Qing instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He immediately sent his divine sense into his storage
treasure, beginning to investigate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only a few
hundred tomes present; in total, there were ten complete sets! Six
sets of Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques! Three sets of divine
abilities! One divine will technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques are useless to me. The divine
abilities?” Ning swept them with his divine sense. “[Heavenly
Transformation], [Three Heads, Six Arms], and [Pentabolt Vajra].”
This caused Ning to feel delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heavenly
Transformation] was a commonly seen divine ability, which virtually
all larger schools and sects possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three Heads, Six Arms]
was in the possession of the Black-White College, but it could be
considered quite a precious divine ability. Ning had yet to train in
it, primarily because he didn’t have enough black-white pellets
yet. Now, however, he had acquired it, and a complete set at that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ability, [Three
Heads, Six Arms]…when executed, it will allow me to grow four more
arms that are identical to real arms.” Ning was extremely excited.
Actually, at the Void level, powerful Fiendgod Body Refiners were
capable of transforming a single strand of hair into a clone, and
could completely change their physical appearance. It would be
extremely easy to even generate eighteen new arms, but that would
just be a superficial change; those wouldn’t be true arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why [Three
Heads, Six Arms] was so powerful was because the heads and arms it
generated were absolutely real, allowing one’s power to truly rise
exponentially! Ning could execute the [Starseizing Hand] divine
ability with two arms, but once he used the [Three Heads, Six Arms]
technique, all six arms would be able to use the [Starseizing
Hand]…this was why Ning had always deeply desire to acquire this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t acquire
it at the Black-White College, but I acquired it here.” Ning was
absolutely overjoyed. “The [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique, when
synergized with my [Starseizing Hand]…the power will definitely be
exponentially greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Pentabolt Vajra]?”
Ning, with a thought, made a book appear in his hand. It was the
first volume of the [Pentabolt Vajra]. He began to flip through it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Pentabolt Vajra]
was a divine ability which only a true Fiendgod, or perhaps a
Fiendgod Body Refiner who was very close to being a true Fiendgod,
was capable of learning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I
trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].” Ning
let out a secret sigh of relief. Previously, when he had been at the
local Raindragon Guard branch, Ning had discovered that some supreme,
top-tier divine abilities had extremely high requirements for
Fiendgod Body Refiners. Some actually stated outright that only
someone who trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] or someone who was a true Fiendgod could train in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That Immortal of the
Raindragon Guard had also told Ning…that once he passed the trials
of the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, he would soon come to
learn how truly powerful the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was so mighty was because
it allowed the user to train in some truly top-tier divine abilities,
including some which generally only Fiendgods were able to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Pentabolt Vajra]…to
bathe in thunder and lightning and form a vajra-like body. Only after
five baptisms by five types of lightning can one be said to have
mastered it. But the fifth one actually requires one to be at the
Empyrean God level before training in it?” Ning was secretly
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the same as the
[Starseizing Hand], which was divided into the Six Cycles. The
[Pentabolt Vajra] was divided into five levels; the highest level was
only trainable by Empyrean Gods. Only at that level could this divine
ability be truly perfected to a supreme level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
simplified version of the legendary divine ability, [Golden Nirmana
Body]?” 1 Ning, upon seeing this, nodded in understanding. The very
first tome said it plainly; this divine ability’s creator had
developed it as a simplified version of the [Golden Nirmana Body], to
be left to his descendants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Nirmana
Body]…it was a legendary divine ability that was one of the top
divine abilities of the entire Three Realms. From the notes in this
tome, at least, the [Golden Nirmana Body] was one of the absolute
best divine abilities. Ning hypothesized that it should be on the
same general level as his own [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which major
power simplified the [Golden Nirmana Body] into this [Pentabolt
Vajra],” Ning mused to himself. “To be able to simplify it…this
major power must be incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting the divine ability book, then took out the divine will
technique. There was only one of them, and it was titled [Soldiers of
the Mind].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soldiers of the
Mind?” Ning had just begun to flip through it, but he suddenly
frowned, then hurriedly sent through their spirit-link, “Little
Qing, hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Little Qing
instantly disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. The stone door
was pushed open, and Xue Hongyi charged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?!” Xue Hongyi
stared in astonishment towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a coincidence.”
Ning glanced at Xue Hongyi, then paid him no attention, immediately
flying out from the stone door that had just been opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi frowned as
he studied the room. It was completely empty, with nothing within. He
hesitated a moment, then shook his head. “Nah…no way…” He
then turned and left, continuing the search.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the rooms
within the Dao Repository Palace were hidden quite well. Ning
continued to frantically search through them in a seemingly crazed
manner. He didn’t want others to know that he had already acquired
top-tier Ki Refining techniques, divine abilities, and a divine will
technique. It must be understood that the Yuchi clan had suffered
annihilation, simply because they had been discovered to be in
possession of a single divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, it was best not
to casually reveal such things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong gave
the stone book in front of him a glance. He had already completely
refined the core to this Dao Repository Palace, and everything within
it was now under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” He closed his
eyes, sensing everything in the palace. “Nothing? There is actually
nothing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His senses were telling
him that the entire Dao Repository Palace didn’t have a single book
within it. It was completely empty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another hour passed.
Ning and the others had just reunited with Youngflame Nong at the
outermost hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re all here.
Did you find any divine abilities or secret arts?” Youngflame Nong
laughed as he looked at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all shook their
heads. Ning, too, shook his head. “Nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Rainbowflame
Fairy and Adept Vastriver were fairly lucky; they discovered those
Heaven-ranked techniques,” Xue Hongyi spoke out. “But…there
should be Immortal-ranked techniques, divine abilities, and secret
arts. We didn’t find them anywhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that those
things were too valuable, and so they weren’t placed in the Dao
Repository Vault, and were instead hidden somewhere else?” Northson
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm, that’s
possible,” Ning nodded.
</P>

Chapter 20 - The Final Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong gave
the group of Wanxiang Adepts a look. He mused to himself, “Perhaps
they aren’t in the Dao Repository Palace…or perhaps one of them
has them. Still, Immortal Witchriver was merely a Diremonster
Immortal; his roots weren’t that deep. Even if he had some divine
abilities or techniques, the Youngflame clan probably has them as
well. And they are still very useful to me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, since we
have finished our investigations, then let us head to the final
palace,” Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
immediately began to grow nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
Youngflame Nong took out yet another magic treasure, a flying
weaver’s shuttle. The flying shuttle expanded to thirty meters long
and ten meters wide. Ning and the others entered it, which was quite
roomy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The flying
shuttle immediately exited the Dao Repository Palace. As they
emerged, the Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang was already waiting for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Xiangliu Fang transformed into a streak of light, flying towards the
shuttle
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong smiled
and nodded towards Xiangliu Fang, seeming somewhat relaxed. But then,
he turned his head to stare at the final golden Skypillar of light,
and the many monstrous Dao-soldiers guarding it. He snorted coldly,
“These monstrous Dao-soldiers have blocked me repeatedly. After I
bind this Immortal estate, I am definitely going to repay them for
their actions!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could the
monsters of a puny little Immortal estate possibly withstand the
Youngflame clan?” Xiangliu Fang laughed as well, and Youngflame
Nong nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were secretly surprised…why was it that Youngflame Nong didn’t
seem to be the slightest bit worried?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many monstrous
Dao-soldiers…” Ning mused to himself, “The Seawave Dao-soldiers
and the Yaksha Dao-soldiers are all far more powerful than ordinary
Loose Immortals; even Xiangliu Fang was dominated. What sort of
treasure does this Youngflame Nong have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, he seems quite confident,” Northson said with a
smirk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s watch and
see,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the flying shuttle
continued to fly forward, constantly advancing towards that distant
golden Skypillar of light and the Seawave Dao-soldiers and the Yaksha
Dao-soldier formations surrounding it. They were now quite close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans!” A deep
voice shook the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong just
laughed icily, while next to him, Xiangliu Fang spoke out on his
behalf. “What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, there is
no need for you to fight with us, the monstrous races of the Immortal
estate world. So long as you are willing to open up a corridor out
with your key and let us leave to the world of the Grand Xia Empire,
then we are willing to permit you to enter this final palace,” the
deep voice said. Immortal Duohe and Immortal Witchsui both felt that,
given these humans still dared to advance in the face of so many
monstrous Dao-soldiers, that they probably felt confident in passing
through them. Thus, Immortal Duohe and Imimortal Witchsui quickly
came to the decision of negotiating with these humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let you leave?
That’s not impossible.” Youngflame Nong revealed a smile. “But
I have a requirement.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Speak. What
requirement.” The deep voice echoed forth once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple. Hand over
all of your Dao-armors, and I’ll let you leave.” Youngflame
Nong’s voice also echoed out in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of our
Dao-armors?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill this human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In his dreams!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of ferocious
howls rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Dao-armors had
been left behind by Immortal Witchriver, and were the reason why
these monsters were so powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without the
Dao-armors, we would be like a pile of loose sand; we wouldn’t even
be able to defeat that Fiendgod by your side. In fact, we’d
probably be beaten by him instead,” the deep voice thundered
angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can swear an oath
to the Dao of the Heavens that if you are willing to hand over all of
your Dao-armors, that I will let you leave and will not pursue or
kill you,” Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-armors
interested Youngflame Nong the most; if he could obtain them easily,
then he wouldn’t mind letting the wielders of them leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!” The
deep voice bellowed angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then don’t blame
me for this,” Youngflame Nong shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are forcing us!”
The deep voice snarled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. So what if I
am?” Youngflame Nong snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These powerful monsters
were bloodthirsty to begin with. Given how excessive Youngflame Nong
had behaved, they were now truly angered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
sky-filling wave arose, blotting out the heavens and smashing down
towards the flying shuttle which Ning and Youngflame Nong were
riding. The flying shuttle, however, went directly towards the giant
wave with incredible agility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the moment.”
A long time ago, Youngflame Nong had produced a queer-looking disc in
his hand, which was a mixture of black and white in color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“POLARIS
STARSHIFTER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong let out
an angry roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black and white
bi-colored disc floated into the air. A ray of black light enveloped
the entire flying shuttle, while a ray of white light shot directly
towards part of the distant Yaksha Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space instantly
distorted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That portion of the
distant Yaksha Dao-soldiers instantly disappeared, then appeared in
the location where the shuttle had been. As for the flying shuttle,
it appeared in the location where those Yaksha Dao-soldiers had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.” As soon as
the shuttle appeared, a corridor into the palace appeared. Swoosh!
The long shuttle flew directly into the tunnel, and then the gate
shut behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Duohe and
Immortal Witchsui were completely stunned. All of the Dao-soldiers
were stunned. Then stared stupidly at the bi-colored black and white
disc. As the energies of the disc were used up, it silently,
soundlessly shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They entered?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They entered, just
like that?” Immortal Duohe and Immortal Witchsui, as well as all
the other monsters, had looks of disbelief, anger, and despair in
their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It shouldn’t have
been like this. It shouldn’t have…” Immortal Duohe’s eyes
were filled with boundless rage. Raising his head, he let out an
earth-rending, pained, agonized roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had lost. Utterly
lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this had been an
actual battle, teleporting away a small part of their Dao-soldiers
would have only been a minor matter. But this wasn’t an actual
battle; the enemy, upon teleporting those soldiers away, had
immediately been able to enter the final palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After this, the
Immortal estate will be bound. After this, all of us will be under
his control.” Immortal Witchsui was mumbling to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, the
countless monstrous Dao-soldiers were all howling in anger, grief,
and despair…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long shuttle appeared
within the hall, with Youngflame Nong, Xiangliu Fang, Ji Ning, and
the others within it. They all emerged from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.”
Youngflame Nong, upon entering, began to laugh joyfully. “We’ve
finally arrived at the final palace. Mmm, and it is quite beautiful
as well, far more so than those other four palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were still feeling shocked by what had happened with that bi-colored
disc. It had actually caused them to completely swap positions with
the distant enemy Dao-soldiers. What treasure was that? Ning, at
least, had never even heard of such a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is much
more beautiful. Every single pillar is exquisitely, intricately
carved,” Xue Hongyi said quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final palace.
After binding it, the entire Immortal estate will be under my
control, and the trial the clan gave me will have been concluded.
I’ll have earned an Immortal estate as well.” Youngflame Nong was
quite delighted, but then he let out a sigh. “What a pity,
though…after entering this Immortal estate, I lost two of my three
most powerful treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures are meant
to be used. After you master the Immortal estate, you’ll acquire
even better treasures, young master,” Xiangliu Fang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope so.”
Youngflame Nong still felt a bit of pain in his heart. The ‘Lock’
scroll and the Polaris Starshifter disc were two of the most powerful
magic treasures he had on him. These were treasures which even many
Loose Immortals didn’t have access to; even if one had large
amounts of liquefied elemental essence, it would be difficult to
purchase them. After all, they were simply too rare. Youngflame Nong
had only managed to acquire them after many years of collecting
resources. Still, for the sake of solidifying his status as the next
Godplume Duke, he had no other choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acquiring the
Immortal estate will mean that I’ll have recouped my costs, and
earned a little on top of it. Those monsters…hmph. They should make
their preparations for all of their descendants to forever be
slaves.” A cold light flashed through Youngflame Nong’s eyes.
“And that Xue Hongyi…I need to acquire his Immortal-ranked magic
treasure as well.”

Chapter 21 - Preparing a Celebratory Feast
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This impressive group
of experts filed in through a corridor, arriving at a massive,
towering hall. The hall was lined with seats, and the walls were
lined with musical instruments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This must have been
the place where, when Immortal Witchriver was alive, he would
merrymake with his monstrous clansmen,” Youngflame Nong laughed
loudly. “These tables, these pillars, and these sculptures…all of
them are utterly exquisite and extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded. They could completely imagine how, countless years ago, the
Diremonsters would all be seated next to those tables, eating and
drinking and making merry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And there. That’s
the place where Immortal Witchriver must have sat.” Youngflame Nong
pointed towards the front of the hall. The front of the hall had the
most beautiful, lavish table of all, and decorative screen behind it
was also exquisite. To each side of the decorative screens, there
were bronze lamps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That bronze lamp was
the core of this Witchriver Palace,” Youngflame Nong said, pointing
towards a Zifu Disciple. “Go next to that bronze lamp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Zifu Disciples
were all Deathsworn. They knew very well that they had been trained,
solely for the purpose of obeying their master. If their master was
to order them to their deaths, they wouldn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the Zifu
Disciple moved to walk towards the front of the hall…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire hall
instantly began to change in appearance. Ning and the others watched
as the scenery around them transformed into a beautiful peach tree
garden. They were surrounded by peach trees, and the floor was
covered with petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful. It is an
illusory formation,” Xiangliu Fang shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it. This
place, the main palace, the Witchriver Palace…there’s no way we’d
be able to acquire it so easily.” Youngflame Nong laughed coldly.
With Uncle Fang present, he wasn’t nervous at all. This was a
formation that had been in storage for countless years, and it didn’t
have anyone truly controlling it; at most, this formation would be
able to unleash a tenth of its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble into
formation.” Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Yu Wei, Adept Vastriver, and
Ninelotus all immediately assembled into that five-elements,
pentagonal formation. All of them were on their guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This illusory
formation is very formidable; even divine sense is unable to see
through it,” Adept Vastriver said. “And I have a vague
feeling…that this formation is even stronger than the one which had
been located in the Vault of Treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation seems
to be gathering Azurewood Godbolts,” Ning said with a frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you
understand a bit about formations as well.” Xiangliu Fang, standing
next to Youngflame Nong, gave Ning a glance, then said calmly, “This
formation activates the power of the Solar Star. Using wood to guide
the power, it generates Azurewood Godbolts. Although no one is
controlling it, you still can’t underestimate the power of the
Azurewood Godbolts. I need some time to break this formation; I wish
all of you the best during this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the five moved closer to each other, prepared to deal with the
Azurewood Godbolts at any moment. They didn’t dare to run about
wildly; to do so in this illusory world was to seek death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I, what should I
do?” Xue Hongyi was panicking internally, but on the surface, he
continued to grit his teeth and wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, three bolts
of azure lightning thundered down from up above, smashing directly
towards Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is
commanding the formation?” Xiangliu Fang was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could someone be
commanding it?” The nearby Youngflame Nong was panicked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Xiangliu Fang
stretched his large hands out. His hands were like dark clouds
capable of covering the skies and smothering the sun; they stretched
out to those three bolts of lightning. Boom, boom, boom…the
lightning struck against the giant hands, and although the giant
hands sank down momentarily, and the skin on the hands split apart as
lightning writhed and spat against them, the hands endured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, young
master, don’t worry.” While receiving the lightning bolts,
Xiangliu Fang actually began to laugh loudly. “Immortal Witchriver
died countless hundreds of millions of years ago; the Witchriver
Palace definitely has no living creatures within it. Anything still
surviving should be a golem. Generally speaking, golems only possess
a simple level of intelligence; at most, they can activate
formations. They aren’t able to control them. After all, this sort
of large formation is quite complicated. Without Immortal Witchriver
passing down the the special technique to control it, there is no way
they will be able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my guess is
correct, the Witchriver Palace should have a powerful golem within
it, and this golem should have a sentient spirit animating it. Thus,
this golem is extremely intelligent, and is thus also skilled in
controlling formations. Immortal Witchriver must have trusted him so
much that he transmitted the formation control method to him,”
Xiangliu Fang laughed. “But unfortunately, he is still merely a
golem, with no elemental ki within his body; at most, he is capable
of unleashing twenty to thirty percent of the power of the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Xiangliu Fang was
speaking loudly, one bolt of thunder after another continued to come
crashing down from the skies. Xiangliu Fang, by himself, received all
of these blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others let
out sighs of relief. Xiangliu Fang’s guess was most likely
accurate; to truly control a formation required the usage of
elemental ki. If the ki was that of an Immortal, then the power of
the formation would naturally increase greatly. But golems didn’t
have any ki at all; even if they were able to control the formation,
they would only be able to, at most, increase its power by a small
amount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans, you are not
the Immortal’s heirs. To barge into the Witchriver Palace is a
capital offense.” A furious shout rang out from within the illusion
of a peach garden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A capital offense?
Who is going to carry out the penalty, you? If my guess is correct,
you are at most comparable to an ordinary Loose Immortal in
strength,” Xiangliu Fang laughed coldly. “Your power is far from
being a match for mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came out, Xiangliu Fang suddenly let out a savage howl. “BREAK!”
Instantly, Xiangliu Fang’s hands swung outward, howling out as the
fingers on his large hands all transformed into giant serpents. The
ten giant serpents instantly latched onto something in the void and
gave it a hard pull. The entire formation immediately seemed to have
been ‘stuck’, and the peach blossom formation trembled, grew
blurry, and completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
An astonished cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the disappearance
of the peach blossom, Ning’s group once more was able to see the
giant hall, and the tables within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad, not bad. I
managed to survive. Fortunately, that golem was extremely intelligent
and knew that it had to kill Youngflame Nong, and so it focused all
of its efforts on him. If those lightning bolts had struck amongst
the rest of us, although those five of the Black-White College would
probably be able to endure it, I would have been in danger.” Xue
Hongyi felt as though he had been blessed with tremendous luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, when he and
Adept Bu You had faced those attacks from the golems, Adept Bu You
had died, while he had been lucky and survived. He had then acquired
an Immortal-ranked magic treasure, and just now avoided yet another
tribulation. He had survived multiple dangerous encounters, and had
even acquired an Immortal-ranked treasure. Wasn’t this a tremendous
blessing of luck?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation is
already broken.” Xiangliu Fang swept the hall with his gaze, then
said calmly, “Everyone, no need to be afraid. Immortal Witchriver
was only a Celestial Immortal, and his roots were not very deep; it
is already quite impressive for him to have produced a golem that is
fairly close to a Loose Immortal in power. If that golem doesn’t
appear, then fine; if he does, however, I’ll capture him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong laughed
and nodded, then instructed, “There are golems lying in wait within
the Witchriver Palace. Everyone, don’t run around rashly; if you
run into those golems, Uncle Fang won’t be able to save you in
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could we dare to
run about rashly? Are we suicidal?” Xue Hongyi hurriedly responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
shared a glance. Clearly, an extremely powerful golem was lying in
wait within the Witchriver Palace. They were no fools; naturally,
they wouldn’t run about wildly within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang and
Youngflame Nong moved to the front of the main hall, beginning to
bind a bronze lamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, this is the
core of the final palace.” Youngflame Nong was utterly delighted.
“After binding it, the entire Immortal estate will be under my
complete control. The Witchriver Palace definitely has other dangers
lurking within; however, there’s no need at all for us to go and
take any risks. Once I bind the Immortal estate, the golems will
naturally have lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you, be
careful; those golems won’t just watch and wait for me to
successfully bind this palace. I imagine they will try to ambush us,”
Youngflame Nong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen savage,
fearsome looking Qiongqi Manticore golems were looking at their
leader, a black- armored, muscular man. The black-armored man
growled, “That person who broke the formation just now, he is most
likely a Fiendgod. He was able to make his hands so large, and his
fingers transform into giant serpents; only true Fiendgods are
capable of such a thing. From the techniques he displayed, I can tell
that he is more powerful than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are starting to
bind the Witchriver Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Qiongqi golems were
all panicking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I estimate he will
need two hours to completely bind the Witchriver Palace,” the
black-armored man said in a low voice. “We need to come up with a
method…and we need to succeed in one try. We need to kill the
humans that Fiendgod is protecting. From the conversation between
those humans when they first arrived, that human should have already
bound the other four palaces. This is the last one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to obey my
orders.” The black-armored man’s cold, dark eyes flashed with a
freezing light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of Zifu
Disciples were scattered in the surrounding area. Ji Ning, Ninelotus,
Adept Vastriver, Xue Hongyi, and the others were all waiting
vigilantly, worried that the golem might suddenly attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong, seated
high above at the front of the hall and binding that bronze lamp,
seeing how nervous everyone in the hall was, couldn’t help but
frown. He barked, “No need to be so nervous. It’s just a few
golems. If one comes, Uncle Fang will capture one. They will
definitely lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others,
including Xue Hongyi, silently tightened their lips. Yes, Xiangliu
Fang could defeat all comers. But the most powerful of those golems
had the combat strength of an ordinary Loose Immortal; if golems of
such power were to suddenly attack and catch this group off guard,
some of them might die. They were not protected by Xiangliu Fang,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attend me.”
Youngflame Nong, seeing how Ning and the others remained vigilant,
couldn’t help but frown and bark, “Prepare a celebratory
banquet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very soon, the two Zifu
Disciple maidservants who personally served Youngflame Nong had
prepared a banquet of fine wine. Actually, during the two day journey
on the warship from Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain to the
Immortal estate, they had often drank and enjoyed themselves, and so
the fine wine had been prepared long ago. Very soon, the table became
filled with wine, spirit-fruit, and delicacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong sat
down in the lotus position, laughing loudly as he scooped up a goblet
of wine. He only needed to use up a small amount of his attention on
binding the bronze lamp. “Everyone, no need to worry. The outer
perimeter will be handled by my Zifu Deathsworn; even if golems
attack, they’ll be the first ones engaged, giving you enough time
to react and fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit, all of you,”
Youngflame Nong called out. Seeing Ning and the others continue to
hesitate, he couldn’t help but snap, “I told you all to sit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged a glance. They had no choice but to sit down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more like
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong
laughed, “You’ve all accompanied me into this Witchriver Immortal
Estate and engaged repeated dangers with me. You’ve rendered quite
a few merits. However, this is the final moment; after I bind this
bronze lamp, the task shall be complete. Although a few golems
continue to resist, they aren’t much to be worried about. Come, let
us toast each other for the treasures we have gained, and for my
successful binding of the Witchriver Immortal Estate.” After
speaking, Youngflame Nong lifted up his bronze wineglass, etched with
a tattoo of flames.

Chapter 22 - Youngflame Nong’s True Face
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us down this cup
together,” Xue Hongyi hurriedly called out. He wanted to flatter
Youngflame Nong as best as he could, because in his heart, he was
still thinking about later leaving the Witchriver Immortal Estate,
then fleeing alive with the Immortal-ranked magic item in tow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow disciples,
we must be vigilant against the outsiders. Let’s not drink this
wine,” Adept Vastriver sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were useful to
him earlier, but now we are useless; who knows what sort of tricks he
might play,” Northson sent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ninelotus said, “I
imagine he wouldn’t dare to be so heartless and crazed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While sending mental
messages amongst themselves, they all lifted up their cups and drank
from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gulp.” The wine
entered Ji Ning’s mouth, then a surge of elemental ki surrounded
the liquid. The liquid was completely vaporized by a streak of fire.
Only then did Ning put down his winecup.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chun and Ji, the two
of you, perform a dance and help us enjoy ourselves.” Youngflame
Nong was in an extremely fine mood as he gave the orders. Instantly,
two of the female Zifu Disciples behind him moved. Previously, their
robes were in the shape of maid robes, but the robes now changed.
Their sleeves fluttered as the two of them laughed, unveiling their
astonishing charisma as the two of them began to dance gracefully in
the center of the palace hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strum. Clink. Three
other nearby Zifu Disciples who were musicians moved to those ancient
musical instruments in the hall, then in a very practiced manner,
began to drum and strum. Although countless years had passed, the
instruments were completely undamaged, as they were all magical
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One melody rang out
after another, while the beautiful courtesans danced. Youngflame Nong
was absolutely delighted with himself as he watched and drank, and
Ning and the others all accompanied him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His spirits having
grown increasingly high as he drank, Youngflame Nong suddenly glanced
sideways at the truly peerless, fairy-like beauty, ‘Yu Wei’. In
terms of appearance and aura, even he, Youngflame Nong, who had seen
reincarnated fairy-like maidens in the capital of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, felt her to be astonishing. His throat went a little dry,
and his heart began to grow heated. The desire he had held down this
entire time was beginning to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, he knew quite
well that this Rainbowflame Fairy would probably be hard to convince.
Thus, he then looked towards Ninelotus, then laughed, “Little
Sister Ninelotus, now that I have completed my task, we need to have
a good celebration. Little Sister Ninelotus, why don’t you perform
a dance to us and help us celebrate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned,
his face growing somewhat unsightly. ‘Little Sister’ Ninelotus?
This was not a form of address for Youngflame Nong to use. And he
wanted Ninelotus to dance? How could Ning not feel angry?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Youngflame Nong
is going too far,” Little Qing sent through the spirit-link.
“Master, this Youngflame Nong holds you in no regard at all; he
knows that you are Ninelotus are Dao-Companions, but he still acts in
such a way.” Indeed, all of the others present in the hall were
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was
astonished as well. She first gave Ning a glance, then said
hurriedly, “Young master Youngflame, I have no talent in dance.
Compared with the beautiful courtesans you have by your side, I am
far inferior; I’d rather not go up and embarrass myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can they compare
with you, Little Sister Ninelotus?” Youngflame Nong laughed, “What,
aren’t you even going to give me, Youngflame Nong, even this tiny
bit of face?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus hesitated a
moment, then put a smile on her face. “Then I’ll go up and dance
to a song.” At the same time, she gave Ning a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just sat there, an
ugly look on his face. It was just a dance. With so many fellow
disciples present, it wasn’t appropriate for Ning to grow angry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, be
careful,” the Whitewater Hound sent spiritually. “Inviting her to
dance as part of the victory celebrations is a small matter.
Youngflame Nong clearly knows that you and Ninelotus are
Dao-Companions, but when he asked her to dance, he didn’t even look
at you or say a single word to you. Clearly, he holds you in no
regard at all. Given that, you need to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately came
to his senses. “Don’t worry, Uncle White. I understand,” Ning
sent back, and then turned to look at Ninelotus, who was dancing in
the middle of the hall, in tune with the melodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning watched, he
suddenly realized…that Ninelotus was actually a very skilled
dancer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truth be told, Ning
knew far too little about the Dongyan clan and the other major clans.
The people which future clan leaders like Ninelotus interacted with
were generally some of the more formidable figures of the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty, and thus she would learn a bit of this and a bit
of that, so as to ensure that her performance in any event was
perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.”
Youngflame Nong laughed as he drank his wine, occasionally clapping
his hands in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was like a
blooming lotus flower, swirling about throughout the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as she moved closer
to Youngflame Nong, Youngflame Nong suddenly swung his arm out. A
long, black whip actually swept out, coiling around Ninelotus’ arm,
then tugging at her. Ninelotus, caught completely offguard, couldn’t
help but be pulled even closer to Youngflame Nong. Still, Ninelotus
was a Wanxiang Adept; by activating her elemental ki, she managed to
stabilize herself as she was pulled closer to Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Youngflame
Nong intimately grabbed her by the arm; he had originally actually
been planning on taking her by the waist. Laughing, he pulled at
Ninelotus’ arm, wanting to pull her in while saying, “Little
Sister Ninelotus, come, let’s drink a cup of wine together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene shocked
everyone present in the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Mu
Northson, Yu Wei, and the others were all shocked. As for Xue Hongyi,
he just gave Ning a sideways glance, revealing a cold smile as he
took a sip of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt as though his
head had gone blank. Earlier, Ninelotus’ dance could have been said
to be a performance for everyone, but now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly rose to
his feet, smashing his hand hard against the table. This table was
technically a Mortal-ranked magic treasure, but it was only used for
holding wine and food; it wasn’t meant for combat. In addition,
Ning was currently gripped by rage, and even his eyes had begun to
turn bloodshot. This slap towards the table was actually even more
powerful than the palm blows he would deliver in a life-or-death
battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The energy wave alone
from this palm blow smashed all of the plates into tiny pieces, and
the fine wine and meat were utterly transformed into dust. BOOM!!!
The entire table actually was split apart. Large amounts of shards
went flying everywhere, and some of them actually sliced across the
body of a nearby Zifu Disciple, causing blood to instantly fly
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Youngflame
Nong immediately gave him a cold look. “What, I can’t even share
a drink of wine with Little Sister Ninelotus?” As he finished
speaking, a hint of anger appeared on Youngflame Nong’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
anger would’ve instantly reduced most people to a quivering pile of
fear. But Ning’s eyes only reddened further. Ignoring all else, he
barked out, “Youngflame Nong!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninelotus realized that Youngflame Nong’s eyes had a hint of a
murderous intent in them, and she immediately barked out towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at
Ninelotus, then said coldly, “Ninelotus, there’s no need for you
to pay any heed to this young master of the Youngflame clan. Hmph.
He’s not even the Godplume Duke yet! When we first followed him
into the Immortal estate, he was so mild and humble. But not that we
are useless to him, this is how he acts!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are courting
death.” Youngflame Nong’s anger was beginning to build.
Previously, Ning was a useful assistant, but he was now useless.
Geniuses like him…they weren’t much in the eyes of him,
Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said angrily, “Do
you remember our original agreement? You made us promises in the name
of your Youngflame clan. What, now that you have the Immortal estate,
you are planning to act against us? Are you feeling greedy for the
treasures we acquired in the Immortal estate? You endured it then,
but are now planning to act against us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be silent!”
Ninelotus cried out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus.” Ning
was utterly infuriated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit down!”
Ninelotus shouted at him, while also sending him a frantic mental
message. “Ji Ning, you are too rash. Think about Youngflame Nong’s
status. He’s normally in the imperial capital, and when together
with the imperial princes and various young dukelings, they often act
in dissolute, wanton ways. I just have to deal with it and drink a
few cups of wine with him, and this matter will be at an end. If you
let anger cloud your mind, then it will be trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent back, “Some
things, I can endure, but others, I cannot. Ninelotus…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you trying to
get yourself killed? You want to fight him?!” Ninelotus sent
furiously, “Don’t be so immature!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immature?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong was
naturally watching the mental argument between Ninelotus and Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
this young and famous Ji Ning doesn’t live up to his reputation,”
Youngflame Nong sent mentally to the Fiendgod by his side, Xiangliu
Fang. “A scene like this has already angered him to the point of
insanity. To deal with him would be simplicity itself. For now,
however, there’s no rush to deal with him; if I kill him within the
Immortal estate, once the news of it is spread out by the Dongyan
clan, the other large tribes will all think of me, Youngflame Nong,
as a narrow-minded man.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Xiangliu
Fang concurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’ words had
truly enraged Ning now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who was Ninelotus? She
was the next leader of the Dongyan clan! There was absolutely no need
for her to compromise in such a manner; since there was no need, why
did she do so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, Ji Ning is still young; please pardon him.” Ninelotus
smiled towards Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong didn’t
continue with his earlier actions. He could tell that if he went just
a bit farther, this Ji Ning probably would actually start to a fight
to the death against him. He dared to kill Ji Ning, but Ninelotus?
Ninelotus was the next leader of the Dongyan clan. If he killed her,
he would be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus quickly
returned to Ning’s side and sat down. Ning remained seated in the
lotus position on his chair. Zifu Disciple servants removed the
shattered magic treasure table in front of him, replacing it with a
new one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” As soon
as Ninelotus returned to her seat, she immediately spoke mentally to
Ning. “Calm down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, so you know I’m
pissed?” Ning looked towards NInelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really was
nothing. This was a small matter. If in the future, you were to see
how the young masters of the major clans act when they are together,
you’ll understand that this sort of minor flirtation…it really
means nothing. Generally speaking, everyone has a bottom line that
they won’t cross; to engage in a little playing around is nothing,”
Ninelotus sent. “You’ve seen too little, which is why you were so
easily enraged. Look over there; after drinking a cup of wine,
Youngflame Nong is no longer harping on this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve seen too
little?” Ning sent back with a shout, “Bottom line? Ninelotus,
you are my Dao-Companion. This so-called ‘a little playing around’
of yours, being embraced by others men, being teased by them,
drinking with them…these thigns have already gone beyond my bottom
line. Do you understand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…how can you
act this way?” Ninelotus was furious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the way I
am. Can it be that you didn’t know?” Ning stared at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and Ning’s
gazes intersected. She could sense the determination and resolve from
Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I won’t be
act like this in the future.” Ninelotus lowered her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head
as well, beginning to drink. Although Ninelotus had bowed her head to
him, Ning still felt as though there were thorns stuck in his heart.
Just now, he truly hoped that Ninelotus would directly refuse
Youngflame Nong. Even if she didn’t throw the cup of wine into
Youngflame Nong’s face, she had to at least turn and immediately
leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this recent period
of time, the two had already argued twice due to differences in the
way they behaved towards others. This time, their fight was due to
the fact that they handled matters and conducted themselves in
completely different ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh. Heh. Heh heh.”
Youngflame Nong, seated at the front of the hall, was able to tell
that there was some unhappiness between Ji Ning and Ninelotus. He
actually laughed…and then his gaze fell towards the nearby
Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei. The flames in his heart blazed even
hotter. The desire he felt towards Yu Wei was far stronger than the
desire he felt towards Ninelotus.

Chapter 23 - Windwing Evasion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few thoughts
were going through Youngflame Nong’s mind. At the same time, the
other members of the Black-White College began to console Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, endure it,” Adept Vastriver sent to Ning.
“After we leave the Witchriver Immortal Estate, you won’t have to
stay here and swallow Youngflame Nong’s attitude.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Yu Wei sent, worried, “We aren’t
able to beat Youngflame Nong right now. However, truly powerful
Immortal cultivators rely on themselves; no matter what how
impressive he might be, in the future, Youngflame Nong will only be
the Godplume Duke, whereas the real powers behind the Youngflame clan
are those old fellows who have lived for countless years. When you
train to the Celestial Immortal level in the future, the Youngflame
clan will treat you with courtesy, not daring to slacken off in the
slightest. What would a Godplume Duke be to you? He’s nothing more
than a titular leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Yu Wei a
look. He had met with the Lord of Cui Manor and Granny Meng, and had
watched as a great power had assaulted the Six Paths of
Reincarnation! His master, Daoist Threelives, was one of the most
incredible figures of the Three Realms…it really was as she had
said; personal strength was the truest foundation to power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning were to also
become a major power of the Three Realms, what would a mere
Youngflame clan, one of the clans subordinate to the Grand Xia
Dynasty’s major world, be to him? There were three thousand major
worlds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as he was able
to reach the Celestial Immortal level, the Youngflame clan would be
respectful to him. After all, it was rare for there to be even a
single Celestial Immortal for every ten thousand Loose Immortals.
Celestial Immortals were true Immortals, who had escaped the binds of
the Three Realms and lived carefree lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother,” Northson sent to him, “If you aren’t happy
with senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus, then as I see it, you should
just break up. I mean, I’m just saying…it’s up to you, and how
you really feel. You need to ask yourself if you truly want for
senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus to be your Dao-Companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Northson a
glance. “Junior apprentice-brother, no need to say anything
further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart…Ning
truly did like Ninelotus. In his past life and in this life, Ning had
never been in a romantic relationship. He couldn’t quite explain
how he felt towards her, but he truly did feel a hazy liking for her.
However, these recent arguments had caused Ning to truly feel upset!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Glugglugglug.”
Ning held his cup, constantly drinking wine. Although he downed one
cup after another, all of the wine continued to be burnt away by
flames after it entered his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sat there in
the lotus position, staring at the constantly drinking Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems Ji Ning is
really angry.” Ninelotus felt frustrated as well. “How can Ji
Ning act like this. I lowered my head to him, and this wasn’t even
a big deal to begin with. This sort of thing is too common; I just
had to deal with it in a casual, superficial manner. Why does he have
to be so angry about it? If he gets angry at this and angry at
that…in the future, after I become the leader of the Dongyan clan,
am I supposed to follow his every wish and desire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let him calm
down and sober up first. He should understand, later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One had been held up
high since childhood, and had been chosen to be the next leader of a
major clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other came from a
world of peace in his past life, and was a genius who had been born
into a backwater clan in this life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
attracted each other. When they had been in the secluded peach-garden
utopia of Serpentwing Lake, there had been no problems, but once they
truly began to face worldly affairs together, their disagreements had
begun to constantly worsen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninelotus were
both feeling rather frustrated in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure carrying a
terrifying, tremendous force came charging in. Those Zifu Deathsworn
that had been stationed in the outer perimeter instantly blew apart,
their bodies being knocked flying and blood spraying verywhere. In
the blink of an eye, the entire hall was transformed into an asura’s
hell, the floor stained with blood and chunks of meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The golem.”
Youngflame Nong, seated at the front of the hall, was greatly
surprised, but then he immediately grew excited and eager.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One golem after another
charged in. As for Ji Ning and the others, as they had been assigned
to sit down at various locations in the table, they weren’t able to
assemble into formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That dogshit
Youngflame Nong…he said that those Zifu Deathsworn would be able to
hold on for a few moments, but in reality, they weren’t able to do
so at all.” Ning’s Darknorth swords appeared in his hands as he
hurriedly blocked the Qiongqi Manticore golem which was pouncing
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
flashed out, crashing against the body of the Qiongqi golem and
sending it flying away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, protect junior apprentice-brother Mu
Northson,” Adept Vastriver sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know, don’t
worry,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This hall was simply
too large. Ning’s group had been divided into two rows that sat on
each end of the table. Ninelotus, Vastriver, and Yu Wei were on the
side opposite to Ning, and were quite far from each other as well. As
for Ning, Northson, and Xue Hongyi, they were on the same side. Right
now, six Qiongqi golems were throwing themselves against Ning and the
rest of the six Wanxiang Adepts. Even more of the golems were
charging towards Youngflame Nong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very easy for
Ning to handle a single Qiongqi golem, but clearly it was a bit
difficult for Northson; Northson was more talented in controlling
golems, not at close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A pair of black
wings appeared on Ning’s back, and the wings fluttered as he began
to execute the Windwing Evasion, howling through the air as he moved
next to Northson. His sword-light flashed out, striking against a
Primal-level Qiongqi golem and sending it flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson was covered with cold sweat, and he
hurriedly controlled a giant silver serpent construct, sending it
into battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s nothing.”
Ning laughed, twin swords in hands, and then lotus petals began to
bloom around him, easily blocking those two Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
including Xue Hongyi, were each dealing with a single Qiongqi golem.
In truth, these six golems weren’t meant to kill them; they were
assigned to keep them tied down. The other twelve Qiongqi golems and
their black-armored leader simultaneously charged towards Youngflame
Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Youngflame Nong laughed loudly. “Capture them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s twin
hands struck out, and those massive hands seemed to cover the skies
as they did so. His fingers transformed into massive serpents, which
seemed to coil about as they moved to wrap around the Qiongqi golems.
In fact, some of them managed to snare two Qiongqi golems each. All
twelve of them were actually seized by his giant hands…but the
black-armored man pulled out a longsword from within his leg with his
right arm, hacking it directly against Xiangliu Fang’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
was filled with a deafening explosion. Actually, it was quite taxing
for Xiangliu Fang to rely on nothing but a pair of hands to capture
those twelve Qiongqi golems. The power of this sword attack was even
more tremendous. His hands trembled and were knocked aside, allowing
the Qiongqi golems to all escape their captor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Xiangliu Fang
was shocked. “This sword of yours…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CHOP. The black-armored
man transformed into a streak of light, charging forwards and
slamming the sword down towards Xiangliu Fang once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
the other twelve Qiongqi golems howled through the air, flying
towards Youngflame Nong. Youngflame Nong frowned, and instantly that
enormous Redscale Salamander appeared around him. At the same time, a
leaf-like Dao-seal appeared in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are rather
irritating.” Youngflame Nong muttered softly, but he felt
completely confident; he had Uncle Fang, the Redscale Salamander, and
a protective treasure; he was definitely going to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Redscale Salamander
howled with rage as it fought against the Qiongqi golems. But
suddenly, a Qiongqi golem reached out to snatch the nearby bronze
lamp, then began to run away withi t!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bronze lamp!”
Youngflame Nong was shocked. Now, he understood. These golems weren’t
meant to kill him; they knew that they weren’t strong enough to do
that. Thus, their real target was the bronze lamp. To bind a
treasure, one had to be right next to it and slowly use one’s
elemental ki to bind it. If one was a bit too far away, or if someone
else took possession of it, then there would be no way for one to
fill it with elemental ki. Naturally, then, there would be no way to
bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This would result in it
taking forever for him to control the Immortal estate. Given how well
these golems knew the Witchriver Palace, they could simply play
hide-and-seek with him within it. The golems could delay for
thousands of years…but he could not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, seize the
bronze lamp,” Youngflame Nong howled furiously..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang
immediately let out an astonishing howl as well. His right arm
suddenly split apart and flew out from his body. His severed right
arm blasted out with a sky-filling black-colored divine power, which
rippled forth, then transformed the right arm into a new Xiangliu
Fang. As for the original Xiangliu Fang, he grew out a new arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
two Xiangliu Fang’s had appeared within the main hall. However, by
the time this splitting process had completed, that Qiongqi golem had
already charged out of the main hall; after all, Primal-level Qiongqi
golems were indeed as fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Xiangliu Fang
remained in combat against the black-armored man. The other, however,
went chasing after the Qiongqi golem that had fled with the bronze
lamp. With a swoosh, he charged into the corridor, continuing his
pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two Xiangliu Fang’s?
A clone?” Ning and the others were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bronze lamp, the
bronze lamp! Damn them, damn them!” Youngflame Nong bellowed with
rage. But right at this moment, at a distant corridor within the
hall, Xiangliu Fang suddenly reappeared, bronze lamp in one hand,
sack in the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Youngflame
Nong instantly laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
black-armored man, he immediately felt disappointed. He knew that the
difference in power between himself and these invading humans was
simply too great; thus, he had hoped to catch them offguard and seize
the bronze lamp. Unfortunately, this Fiendgod was truly too powerful;
the Fiendgod was able to tie him down with one body, then use another
one to chase after the Qiongqi golem and bring the bronze lamp back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The overall
situation has been cast in stone.” Youngflame Nong immediately felt
completely relaxed, watching the battle going on in the rest of the
hall with leisure. But as he did so, his face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was looking at Ning
and Northson, located far away from him. Ning was wielding two
Darknorth swords, and on his back was a pair of black wings; he was
effortlessly blocking two Qiongqi golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wings?” Youngflame
Nong carefully watched the way in which Ning moved. At the same time,
he sent mentally to Xiangliu Fang, “Uncle Fang, look at Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s two
bodies had merged into one again. Fighting at full power once more,
Xiangliu Fang stuffed the black-armored man into his sack. Upon
hearing Youngflame Nong’s words, he immediately turned to look.
Upon doing so, his face changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, that’s
the Windwing Evasion. I’m not mistaken, am I?” Youngflame Nong
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong himself
had never trained in it, but he had watched his clansmen train in it
repeatedly. Because of how often he had seen it, and because he had
personally read the contents of the [Windwing Evasion] manual, he
could see traces of it in the way Ning moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That’s the
Windwing Evasion. I’ve trained in it before. Although Ji Ning is
using wings to mask it, he is definitely using the Windwing Evasion,”
Xiangliu Fang sent mentally. “In the past, the descendants of the
Yuchi clan also used wings to hide it; Ji Ning is using the same old
trick. Although this is a rather clumsy method, unless one has an
extremely deep understanding of the Windwing Evasion, there’s no
way one would be able to tell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong sent
mentally, “Uncle Fang, how could Ji Ning know the Windwing
Evasion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be one of
the surviving spawns of the Yuchi clan!” Xiangliu Fang sent back.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 24 - Enmity Born From Genocide
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surviving spawns of
the Yuchi clan?” Youngflame Nong began to feel a killing intent in
his heart. “Not a single member of the Yuchi clan is to be spared,
and those members of the Yuchi clan who have trained in the Windwing
Evasion are all the more deserving of death. The Windwing
Evasion…only my Youngflame clan can have it. It cannot be learned
by others!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The secret arts and
divine abilities which were unique to a certain major clan were
absolutely forbidden to be taught to others. Any outsiders who
learned these techniques would suffer pursuit and assault!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, let’s
deal with these golems first.” Youngflame Nong had no desire to
play around anymore at all. For the first time, he truly had the
desire to kill Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s two
large hands swished through the air, snatching away at the Qiongqi
golems with abandon while shouting, “Everyone, stop these Qiongqi
golems. Don’t let them escape; if they escape, they’ll cause
problems in the future.” While saying this, he continually captured
Qiongqi golems and stuffed them into his sack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone did their best
to stop the Qiongqi golems from escaping, allowing Xiangliu Fang to
capture them, one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really were
suicidal.” The black wings on Ning’s back disappeared. He gave a
glance to the bloodstained corpses on the ground. Although those Zifu
Disciples were all Deathsworn and were able to assemble into
formation…the difference between them and golems at the Primal
level of power was simply too vast. The first wave of assaults from
the Qiongqi Manticore golems had caused virtually all of the Zifu
Disciples to be wiped out, leaving behind only ten or so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How pitiable. They
were Zifu Disciples…but against these golems, they were completely
useless. And yet, Youngflame Nong insisted on having them watch the
perimeter; clearly, he didn’t give a damn about them dying,” Mu
Northson sent with a mental sigh. “Youngflame Nong truly is
cold-blooded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Deathsworn had
been voluntarily gifted by Northmont Yin and some others. To
Youngflame Nong, however, these Deathsworn had been raised by outside
clans, and there was no way the Youngflame clan would truly trust
them. There was no point to him bringing him back! And yet, he
couldn’t just ‘return’ them back to Northmont Yin. Thus, he
might as well let them die. If some were lucky enough to survive,
then that meant that they had been blessed with good fortune and
might be worthy of bringing back to the clan and training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The few lucky Zifu
Disciple survivors hurriedly began to clean the hall, completely
removing all of the corpses and bloodstains and restoring it to a
pristine condition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong
reseated himself at the front of the hall. His gaze cold, he stared
directly at Ning, then barked, “Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the hall
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, Yu Wei,
Ninelotus, Adept Vastriver, and Xue Hongyi were all astonished; they
could sense that there was a terrifying look in Youngflame Nong’s
eyes, and the cold, tyrannical way he had just shouted was something
they could all sense. Not even earlier, when Ning had shattered the
table, had Youngflame Nong been so formal and cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame.” Ning looked towards Youngflame Nong. “What is it?
Speak..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong.”
This time, it was Ninelotus, seated on the other side, who grew
angry. “Ji Ning is my Dao-Companion. Earlier, he offended you, but
that was just a minor matter. For you to act this way…you are being
a bit too narrow-minded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these young
masters and princes of major clans often chatted and teased each
other, there were some bottom lines that could not be crossed. Ji
Ning was her Dao-Companion, after all, and he had also helped
Youngflame Nong this time. It was one thing for the two of them to
have had a bit of friction earlier, but for Youngflame Nong to act
this way now was going too far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus, you’ll
understand after hearing what I say,” Youngflame Nong said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I shall listen
attentively,” Ninelotus said with cold anger as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I ask you
this.” Youngflame Nong looked at Ning. “Just now, was the divine
ability you displayed the Windwing Evasion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windwing Evasion? How
did Youngflame Nong know about the Windwing Evasion? Ning’s
mother’s clan, the Yuchi clan, had been almost completely
obliterated; most likely, the only remaining member was Ning’s
uncle’s daughter, and Ning didn’t even know if she was still
alive. Ning could be somewhat considered a descendant of the Yuchi
clan…but the Yuchi clan was extremely secretive about the Windwing
Evasion to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to deny it.
You used the Windwing Evasion,” Youngflame Nong said with a cold
laugh. “Uncle Fang, display it for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang suddenly
disappeared from Youngflame Nong’s side. He seemed to have
transformed into a giant Roc, instantly appearing in the center of
the main hall. Then, with another movement, he retreated and returned
to Youngflame Nong’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this, felt
his heart tremble. His other fellow disciples of the Black-White
College couldn’t tell, but he himself, as a practitioner of the
Windwing Evasion, could - Xiangliu Fang truly was using the Windwing
Evasion! In addition, it was even more precise and profound than
Ning’s own usage! But this made sense; after all, Ning was only a
Fiendgod Body Refiner; compared to Xiangliu Fang, a true Fiendgod, he
was still far inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are the
culprits!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are the ones
who annihilated my clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thought suddenly
entered Ning’s mind. “Can it be that it was the Youngflame clan
which annihilated my mother’s Yuchi clan? Can it be that the
grandparents and aunts and uncles who I never met were all slain by
the Youngflame clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well?” Youngflame
Nong looked at Ning. “Is it the same as yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do indeed train in
the Windwing Evasion.” Ning knew that there was no point in lying.
Frowning, he said, “But so what if it is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, Yu Wei,
Adept Vastriver, and Northson all sood there, watching nervously but
not rushing to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong laughed
loudly, “The Windwing Evasion technique was originally unique to
the Yuchi clan of the Eastisle Commandery of our Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this,
felt his heart shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Yuchi clan had
possessed this divine ability for a long, long time; however, they
relied on using wing-type magic treasures to hide it. Our Youngflame
clan, however, found out about it long ago. After preparing for an
extremely long period of time, we annihilated the entire Yuchi clan
in one blow…but were unable to find the original manual of the
[Windwing Evasion]! Some of the powerful Immortals of my Youngflame
clan personally intervene and used a soul-scour technique to collect
enough memories from members of the Yuchi clan to completely rebuild
the [Windwing Evasion] manual from scratch.” Youngflame Nong looked
at Ning. “Right now, the [Windwing Evasion] is unique to my
Youngflame clan, and it is absolutely forbidden to teach it to
others. For you to learn the Windwing Evasion without the permission
of my Youngflame clan…this, in and of itself, merits the death
penalty for you. What’s more, I suspect that you are one of the
surviving spawn of the Yuchi clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SPEAK! Are you a
surviving spawn of the Yuchi clan?” Youngflame Nong stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone else now
completely understood. So this was what it was all about! Warfare
between clans…there was no real right or wrong in inter-clan
warfare! Since the Youngflame clan had annihilated the Yuchi clan,
and the Yuchi clan’s Windwing Evasion technique was now solely
possessed by the Youngflame clan…from the Youngflame clan’s
standpoint, it was true that all descendants of the Yuchi clan had to
be annihilated. After all, between the two clans, there was now a
grudge that stemmed from clan genocide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninelotus sent to Ning, saying frantically, “No matter what, don’t
admit that you are a descendant of the Yuchi clan. If you admit to
it, given that there is hatred that stems from clan genocide between
you and the Youngflame clan, the Youngflame clan will definitely not
permit you to remain alive. You only need to say that you acquired
the original copy of the [Windwing Evasion] manual through
happenstance, and that without knowing the full backstory, you
learned it. Thus, since you didn’t know it was forbidden to learn
it, you cannot be blamed. I will have my Dongyan clan engage in
negotiation with the Youngflame clan on your behalf, and this matter
will quickly come to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Youngflame Nong and Xiangliu Fang. His heart was filled with
boundless rage. The Immortals of the Youngflame clan had soul-scoured
the souls of many Yuchi clansmen in order to remake a complete
Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon being
soul-scoured, one’s soul would generally be dispersed and
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn. Damn!”
Ning truly wanted to take revenge for his mother’s entire clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you the
surviving spawn of the Yuchi clan?” Youngflame Nong stared at Ning,
his murderous intent billowing to the heavens. Previously, during the
banquet, he had just been flirting a bit with Ninelotus; he hadn’t
truly felt any desire to kill Ning. After all, he had to protect the
Youngflame clan’s face and reputation. However, if Ning truly was a
spawn of the Yuchi clan, then even the patriarchs of the Youngflame
clan were present, they would still mercilessly kill Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, he was
the representative of the entire Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am not.” Ning
stared at Youngflame Nong and Xiangliu Fang. He forcibly repressed
his anger and said in a low voice, “Youngflame Nong, if you want to
kill me, there’s no need for you to put on such a show to find an
excuse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My senior
apprentice-brother has already spoken; there is no relationship
between himself and the Yuchi clan,” Northson said angrily. “Young
master Youngflame, we came here to help you; is this how you are
going to treat us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame, since my junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has said that
he is not a descendant of the Yuchi clan, that means he is not. He
most likely acquired this divine ability through a fortuitous
encounter. He can negotiate with your Youngflame clan and offer some
compensatory gifts, then swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens that
he absolutely will not pass this divine ability out ot anyone else,”
Adept Vastriver said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei spoke out as
well. “Young master Youngflame, for you to claim at a time like
this that junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is a descendant of the
Yuchi clan…once word of this spreads, people will think that it is
you, Youngflame Nong, who intentionally sought out an excuse to act
against him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong.”
Ninelotus stared at Youngflame Nong as well. Filled with wrath, she
said, “Ji Ning is my Dao-Companion!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was standing
out, pressuring Youngflame Nong from all sides. But he only laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…don’t
worry,” Youngflame Nong said with a laugh. “Since Ji Ning has
accompanied me on this trip through the Immortal estate, I’ll give
him a chance to live.” As he spoke out, he produced a set of black
manacles, covered with ancient golden runes. He tossed the manacles
directly towards Ning. Clank. They landed on the ground before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are godlock
chains.” Youngflame Nong looked towards Ning. “Upon being
manacled, you’ll be like an ordinary mortal. Even Fiendgods, when
locked by these chains, won’t be able to resist. Put these chains
on and wait for my orders. I can swear an oath as well; so long as
you are not a spawn of the Yuchi clan, I absolutely will not kill
you, nor harm your power. I will go out and engage in an
investigation. If, however, I can verify that you are a spawn of the
Yuchi clan, I will kill you. If you are not? I’ll release you to
your freedom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning furrowed his
brows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei spoke out in a
high voice, “Young master Youngflame, think about how powerful your
Youngflame clan is; is it necessary for you to act in such a petty
manner? You can let junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning go free for
now, then engage in your investigations; upon verifying the results,
you can act against him later. Can it be that in the face of the
power of your Youngflame clan, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning
would be able to escape your reach?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, do you
agree or not?” Youngflame Nong looked at Ning. “I’ve given you
your only way out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at
Youngflaem Nong. “You want me to chain myself and hand over my life
to you? Do you think this is possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
face instantly turned even colder and more sinister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, Ning
would not voluntarily put the godlock chains around himself. But
right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Youngflame!” The nearby Xue Hongyi suddenly laughed coldly as he
pointed at Ning. “Don’t listen to his lies. This Ji Ning’s
father was known as Ji Yichuan, while his mother was known as Yuchi
Snow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You learned the
Windwing Evasion, and your mother was Yuchi Snow?” Youngflame Nong
instantly revealed a savage look on his face, and his voice became as
cold as ice. “So you truly are the spawn of the Yuchi clan! Die! Ji
Ning shall die! Anyone who attempts to block the path of the
Youngflame clan in doing so will be killed, without reservation!”

Chapter 25 - Grand Dao Domain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone close to Ji
Ning, such as Mu Northson and Ninelotus, all knew that Ning’s
mother was named Yuchi Snow. However, they all wanted to try and buy
him some time; at the very least, they wanted to make sure that could
leave this major world alive. Later on, the Dongyan clan and the
Black-White College could use some methods at their disposal to
ensure that Ning could be sent and escape to other lesser worlds, or
perhaps even a different major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi had
thoroughly investigated Ning long ago, and had even purchased a set
of intelligence reports regarding Ning from the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. Naturally, he knew who Ning’s parents were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong!”
Ninelotus was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold!” Yu Wei’s
forehead suddenly began to glow with white light. Her aura quickly
became terrifying as she, too, roared with fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver and Mu
Northson all called out in anger as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang only
stretched out a single hand, which instantly expanded to a tremendous
size. At the same time, his five fingers transformed into five giant
serpents, each more than three hundred meters long. They stretched
out towards Ninelotus, Yu Wei, Northson, and Adept Vastriver. Every
single serpent emanated a terrifyingly powerful aura, causing the
faces of Ninelotus and the others to become unsightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus, I won’t
kill you.” Youngflame Nong pointed towards Ninelotus. “But those
three fellow disciples of yours…Uncle Fang, if they dare interfere,
just kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he felt lust
towards Yu Wei…women, to Youngflame Nong, were nothing more than
playthings. Playthings, in the end, were still playthings; they could
be killed at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, Northson, Yu
Wei, and Adept Vastriver all stared towards him with hatred, but they
knew exactly how strong Xiangliu Fang was; he was absolutely capable
of crushing them. Although they had some protective items on them,
those items would at most allow them to stay alive for a short period
of time. To completely change the situation…was impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-sister, junior
apprentice-brother…Ninelotus.” Ning looked towards Youngflame
Nong, seated at the front of the hall, then said calmly, “There’s
no need for you to intervene. This is a matter between myself and
Youngflame Nong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninelotus called out frantically towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Ninelotus. “Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOUNGFLAME NONG!!!”
Ninelotus was absolutely livid. “You are provoking my Dongyan
clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it was the
Forefather of the Dongyan clan who said these words to me, then I
might truly be forced to reconsider. But you?” Youngflame Nong
laughed, then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus suddenly
produced a black lotus petal in her hand, a petal with an aura that
inspired terror. The black lotus petal quickly expanded, causing
Xiangliu Fang to called out icily, “Are you looking to die!?” His
giant python-finger instantly smashed headlong against the black
lotus flower, which trembled, then began to crack. This cracked black
lotus flower continued to fly straight towards the giant serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant serpent
quickly froze into a statue of ice, then shattered apart. In fact,
Xiangliu Fang’s entire hand became frozen, all the way to his
elbow, then began to splinter across. However, Xiangliu Fang’s arm
then once more grew out. WHAP. His fingers once more transformed into
serpents, striking heavily against Ninelotus and causing her to be
knocked flying, vomiting blood from her mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.
Unfortunately, you were only capable of injuring Uncle Fang.”
Youngflame Nong shook his head. “Even I am unable to produce
treasures capable of killing Uncle Fang. You?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang was of
the ancient Fiendgod ‘Hydraga’ race; his lifeforce was incredibly
powerful, and his combat ability was comparable to a peak Loose
Immortal’s. To kill Xiangliu Fang? This was an incredibly hard
task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xue Hongyi, I’ll
give you a chance to render merits for yourself.” Youngflame Nong
looked towards Xue Hongyi. “Go and kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? Kill Ji Ning?”
Xue Hongyi was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you going to
kill him or not?” Youngflame Nong’s eyes flashed with a cold
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi mentally
cursed nonstop. He had been flattering Youngflame Nong this entire
time, and had even told him that Ning’s mother was named Yuchi
Snow. He had done all of this in the hopes of making Youngflame Nong
like him…but who would’ve imagined that Youngflame Nong would be
this vicious? Youngflame Nong had actually ordered him to go kill Ji
Ning…he had no confidence in being able to do so at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, yes, kill.”
Xue Hongyi nodded frantically, but in his heart, he thought to
himself, “I’m not going to be able to kill Ji Ning, but I should
be able to stay alive at least.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, prepare to
die,” Xue Hongyi called out with anger, then instantly shot out a
series of flying needles towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong and
Xiangliu Fang stood there at the front of the hall, watching this
happen. A look of anticipation was in Youngflame Nong’s eyes. “Xue
Hongyi’s strength should be a bit weaker than Ji Ning’s; if Ji
Ning really was to go all-out against him, he should be able to kill
Xue Hongyi…and after Xue Hongyi dies, his Immortal-ranked magic
treasure will be mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fang, after
Xue Hongyi dies, you attack and kill Ji Ning,” Youngflame Nong
sent. “The Immortal-ranked magic treasure will be mine then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master,”
Xiangliu Fang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing Youngflame
Nong say, the words, “Ji Ning shall die” and “anyone who
attempts to block the path of the Youngflame clan in doing so will be
killed,” Ning had already made up his mind to kill Youngflame Nong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang was far
too powerful; Ning didn’t feel any confidence in his ability to
defeat him, but he had no choice now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Xue Hongyi
charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First you. Then
Youngflame Nong.” Ning wielded his Darknorth swords in his hands.
At this point, he couldn’t be bothered to use wings to hide his
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of flying
needles filled the skies, shooting towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Ning let
out an enraged bellow. In this moment, Ning’s sword-heart was more
steadfast and firm than it had ever been before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, he had
embarked on a brand new path. If he didn’t kill Youngflame Nong,
then due to being physically located within this Immortal estate, he
wouldn’t be able to escape. He would die! But if he did kill
Youngflame Nong, someone who had the highest chances to become the
next Godplume Duke…the Youngflame clan would definitely pursue him
with full power. This was a clan that was even more terrifyingly
powerful than the Northmont clan of Stillwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two roads lay ahead of
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was the road to
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other was the road
of being pursued by the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having been
pressured to this extent…Ning actually became incomparably
resolved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul became
completely pure and transparent in this moment, more than it ever had
been before. Ning suddenly felt as though time itself slowed down.
Something that he had been struggingly this entire time to reach, and
yet had never been able to…finally, he truly had reached it, and
embarked on a new journey through his Grand Dao. This was…the Grand
Dao of the Sword! A vast, awe-inspiring Grand Dao! In this moment,
Ning felt as though he had transformed into a sword that was swimming
through the entirety of the Grand Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…Ning
had completely reached the Grand Dao Domain level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Immortal cultivators who trained in a Dao all had the chance to reach
the ‘Dao Domain’ level, but that was generally only true for an
ordinary Dao. The Dao of the Sword, however, was one of the Grand
Daos; to reach the Grand Dao Domain was far more difficult than even
completely mastering an entire Dao-Path. Although Ning had reached
the fifth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword] long ago, if he hadn’t
been placed under such enormous pressure this time, causing his heart
to suddenly and completely comprehend and allow him to pass through
the final barriers, it would have remained very difficult for him to
reach this new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his sea of
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul suddenly
transformed into a sword, an incomparably dazzling sword. This was
the sword-soul, which only a Sword Immortal who had truly reached the
Grand Dao Domain level would possess. This was a fundamental change,
an evolution of the soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword suddenly
transformed into Ji Ning’s appearance…but the spirit-Ning faintly
emanated with the light of a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the purpose
of a life lived?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I ask for is to
be joyful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exterminate all
injustices!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exterminate all
those who deserve killing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only then will I be
exultant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As Loose Immortals,
there is no path to immortality.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Better to live
passionately for a day, than to live a century while stifled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword is the
joyous sword, the sword of passion, the sword which exterminates all
injustices. The name of this sword technique is the [Three-Foot
Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While battling against
Xue Hongyi, Ning suddenly began to laugh. Laugh loudly, and with joy.
“Kill, kill, kill; exterminate all ijustices, and exterminate all
those who need killing! Better to live passionately for a day, than
to live a century while stifled.” As Ning laughed loudly, the
Darknorth swords in his hands suddenly became incomparably brilliant
and incomparably awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An unfathomably
terrifying sword-aura instantly filled the entire hall. A dazzling
streak of sword-light lashed out, tearing through the flying needles
as though they were made of rotting wood, then sliced across Xue
Hongyi’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I, I…” Xue
Hongyi’s eyes were completely round. He had never imagined that he
would end up like this. Filled to the brim with terror, even his soul
began to crack and shatter under the terrifying sword-aura filling
the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…his body
fell into two parts on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword]…the Grand Dao Domain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Three-Foot Sword],
as the highest level sword art of the Black-White College, had six
stances that were available to the public. The final three stances,
however, were limited to direct, Epochal Transmission for Sword
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stance -
Lustrous Sword-Heart
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stance -
Manifold Thistlethorns
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stance -
Sudden Sword-Light
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stance - Sun
in the Sky
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stance -
Moonlight Hiding the Sword
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance -
Grand Dao Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These sword stances
weren’t completely set in stone; for example, the first stance,
Lustrous Sword-Heart, was different for each person, depending on how
they comprehended it. The [Three-Foot Sword] primarily served as a
guide. It guided Sword Immortals towards techniques that suited them
best. Every single practitioner of the [Three-Foot Sword] was capable
of executing the [Three-Foot Sword] in a way which suited them the
most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In dire straits, Ning’s
heart had completely merged into the Grand Dao, allowing him to reach
the Grand Dao Domain level. The power of this sixth stance he had
comprehended was truly incomparably frightening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this a Grand Dao
Domain?” Youngflame Nong watched as a terrifying sword-aura washed
over the entire hall, causing even his own soul to shudder.
Youngflame Nong’s face completely changed from its previous, calm
and smug look. He stared at Ji Ning, this young man from a backwater
clan, who seemed to have gone berserk and who had just killed Xue
Hongyi with one blow. “How old is he? He actually…actually has
already reached the Grand Dao Domain level? And in the Dao of the
Sword, the most offensive of Daos?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong
suddenly felt jealousy in his heart; why couldn’t he be this
talented? Why did this sort of talent had to fall onto a rustic youth
like this one?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Dao Domain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dao of the
Sword…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Adept
Vastriver, and Ninelotus were in a state of shock. The sword-aura
that filled the hall…all of them could feel the resoluteness, the
sharpness, the indomitableness emanating from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword was a sharp
weapon. The heart of a Sword Immortal…only one whose heart was
truly as sharp, resolute, and indomitable as a sword would be capable
of truly comprehending the exquisiteness of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword emerged,
there was no room for regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword emerged,
it could not be blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what it meant
to be a Sword Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Ning
wielded his twin swords in his hands. His body suddenly increased
dramatically as he transformed into a thirty meter tall giant as he
simultaneously executed his divine ability, [Starseizing Hand] as
well. In this moment, the sword-light in Ning’s hands had reached
an awe-inspiringly powerful level. But Xiangliu Fang just let out a
furious growl, smashing out with his palm, which swept forward like a
dark stormcloud as the giant serpents that were his fingers
ravenously bit down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An explosive sound rang
out. The flesh on Xiangliu Fang’s serpent-hand split open, and
fresh blood sprayed everywhere as divine power lashed everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was sent flying
nback as well, blood spewing out from his mouth. In this moment, Ning
understood…that although his power had increased dramatically,
compared with Xiangliu Fang, who possessed the power of a peak Loose
Immortal, the difference in power was simply too great. The opponent
was able to defeat him with just one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, Yu Wei, and
Ninelotus all called out in alarm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While being knocked
backwards, Ning’s eyes became filled with madness. That black loop,
which had been tucked into his bracer the entire time, suddenly
appeared in his palm. This was the treasure which Daoist Threelives
had personally forged; of Ning’s two important life-saving
treasures, it was the only one capable of an active attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no other
choices left to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GO!” Ning waved
his hand, sending the black loop flying out.
</P>

Chapter 26 - Killing Youngflame Nong
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black loop seemed
quite ordinary, but as Xiangliu Fang struck out with his massive,
dark, cloud-like hand, with those giant, serpentine fingers…the
black loop actually passed straight through it. The giant Fiendgod’s
hand wasn’t harmed at all; it was as though the black loop was
composed of a different type of force, as though it was illusory. It
passed straight through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Xiangliu Fang was completely flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
Youngflame Nong’s eyes were filled with a murderous intent as well,
but then…he too stared in amazement at the black loop which had
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A seemingly ordinary
black loop, but it caused both Youngflame Nong and Xiangliu Fang to
feel nervousness, because they had no idea what sort of a treasure it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them was an
ancient Fiendgod with vast experience. The other was
all-but-guaranteed to be the next Godplume Duke, who similarly had
seen many things. The two of them had seen countless treasures…but
they had never seen a treasure like this before. In fact, they
couldn’t even tell what it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This black loop
easily passed through Xiangliu Fang’s massive, Fiendgod hand…and
didn’t injure it in the slightest?” Mu Northson was completely
awestruck as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an ordinary
person being ‘struck’ by a ghost; the ghost would pass straight
through the person. When Xiangliu Fang and the sphere collided, the
sphere shot straight through him. But Xiangliu Fang, as a Fiendgod,
had an incredibly powerful level of divine power; if it had been a
ghost or something like a ghost, it would have been shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What queer thing is
this?” NInelotus was amazed as well. She came from the Dongyan
clan, but had never heard of such a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Adept
Vastriver had long ago awakened fragments of his former memories, but
he felt puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei originally had a
look of puzzlement, but then she revealed a look of astonishment.
“Can this be…how can it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black loop flew
into the air directly above Youngflame Nong and Xiangliu Fang, and as
it did, it suddenly emanated a soft, hazy glow, causing it to appear
dreamlike and illusory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shatter,” Xiangliu
Fang howled angrily. A long awl appeared in his hand, filled with a
boundless, savage aura, and Xiangliu Fang stabbed the black loop
viciously with his awl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect me.”
Youngflame Nong also felt that this black loop was extremely bizarre.
He had already taken out that leaf-like Dao-seal earlier, in order to
protect against the black-armored golem’s sudden ambush if
necessary. He now shattered it right away. Instantly, a hazy golden
aura covered him with a tight defensive aura. “This would be able
to withstand for a few moments against even a full-strength attack
from a Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang’s
ferocious stab…missed. It was as though the black loop didn’t
exist at all; or perhaps, it existed on a completely different plane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black loop
continued to emanate that hazy light. Suddenly, an invisible,
devouring ripple swept out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong and
Xiangliu Fang’s faces both changed dramatically. They could both
sense that invisible devouring force…and it was aimed directly at
their souls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHH!! NO—!”
Youngflame Nong’s face turned incomparably savage and terrified. He
let out a hideous howl…and then, his soul left his body. Twisting
and distorting, it was forcibly drawn into that black loop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong was a
peak Wanxiang Adept, and ever since he was young, he had access to an
extremely high level visualization technique; his soul was comparable
to a Primal Daoist’s by now, and so naturally it could almost take
physical form. Ning and everyone else personally witnessed his
twisting, distorting soul howl in anguish as it was drawn into the
black loop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
treasure is this? How can it absorb my soul? How can…how can…how
can this be my end? How could I have died to this Ji Ning? Is my soul
about to be destroyed? Ji Ning, Ji Ning, spare me, spare me!”
Youngflame Nong’s soul let out a soundless screech, continuing to
twist and distort as it was drawn deeper and deeper within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Xiangliu
Fang was struggling in a berserk manner. And yet…his powerful
Fiendgod’s soul was still being forcibly ripped out from his
Fiendgod body. As a Primal-level Fiendgod who was capable of creating
a clone of himself, it was clear that his soul had long ago
completely merged with his Fiendgod body, fusing into one. And yet,
it was still being forcibly ripped out right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an enormous
soul, and it was letting out earth-shaking bellows that shook the
entire hall…but it, too, was being drawn into the black loop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong and
Xiangliu Fang, despite their protective treasures or powerful divine
bodies…had their souls forcibly devoured by this terrifying,
bizarre treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack. The black loop
let out a clear sound, like a piece of ice breaking. Instantly, it
shattered apart, dissipating and melting in midair, leaving nothing
behind at all. Even Youngflame Nong and Xiangliu Fang’s souls had
completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slump.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
body remained standing there for a moment, eyes completely blank, and
then his body slumped gently to the ground. The mighty Xiangliu Fang
remained standing for a moment as well, but then he too collapsed to
the ground, no longer breathing. This ancient Fiendgod, who had been
born in the Fiendgod Era, then been enslaved by the Youngflame
clan…finally died on this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong and
Xiangliu Fang just…just…just died, like that?” Northson stared
with huge eyes. He cleared his throat repeatedly, completely
awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead. This…this…”
Adept Vastriver was completely awestruck as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and Yu Wei
both looked at the two collapsed, lifeless figures as well; one
master, the other a servant. They felt as though they were in a
dream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang had been
so powerful! He was an ancient Fiendgod! As for Youngflame Nong, his
background and status were both mighty as well; earlier, when dealing
with the monstrous Dao-soldiers, he had taken out the likes of the
‘Lock’ scroll and the ‘Polaris Starshifter’ treasure. They
had watched him do this and had realized how truly extraordinary the
next Godplume Duke truly was, and how many protective items he had.
But the end result? They had both died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, who had been
knocked flying backwards and had vomited out blood, revealed a look
of astonishment as well. He had never imagined that the black loop
would be this powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had originally
selected the black loop, the giant yellow bear had said to him, “Ji
Ning, to tell the truth, I originally didn’t want to give you this
treasure. However, after you grow more powerful, it will no longer be
of much use to you, as by the time you become a Primal, you’ll be
able to carry around this underwater estate with you. The Wanxiang
Adept period…this is the period in an Immortal cultivator’s life
when he is most susceptible to dying. This treasure was personally
forged by my master; although he did so casually, it is more than
enough to keep you alive. You can consider it a second life….but it
can only protect you once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure
personally forged by Daoist Threelives…even though he made it in a
casual way, it was simplicity itself for it to devour the souls of a
Primal Fiendgod and a Wanxiang-level noble of a major clan.” Ning
couldn’t help but sigh in astonishment to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He only knew that this
black loop was meant for the sole purpose of drawing in and
eradicating souls…but up till now, he had no idea how powerful it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was only amazed
for a second. In the next instant, however, he understood that he had
embarked on a path of no return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, ever since
Youngflame Nong had determined that Ning was a descendant of the
Yuchi clan and moved to kill him, Ning had already embarked on a path
of no return. Either he would be killed by Youngflame Nong, or he
would kill Youngflame Nong. These were his only two options! But by
killing Youngflame Nong, someone who was virtually guaranteed to be
the next Godplume Duke, and whose background was incredibly
astonishing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong’s
status within his clan was similar to Ning’s former status in the
Ji clan of West Prefecture City; Ning had both the Lord Prefect and
his own father supporting him. For it to be all but determined that
Youngflame Nong would be the next Godplume Duke meant that he
definitely had an incredibly powerful figure supporting him as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong had
died. If only for emotional reasons alone, that powerful figure would
come to seek revenge! Aside from saving face for the Youngflame clan,
revenge for Youngflame Nong would also be an important reason!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
actually began to laugh loudly. With a wave of his hand, he sent out
a streak of earthfire, which burnt the corpse of Xue Hongyi to ash.
He then collected the magic treasures which Xue Hongyi had left
behind. Xue Hongyi had that Immortal-ranked magic treasure;
naturally, since Ning was about to flee for his life, he would want
to carry as many treasures with him as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step,
Ning moved to Youngflame Nong and the Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang’s
corpses. A streak of earthfire burned Youngflame Nong’s corpses to
gray ash, but the earthfire was completely unable to damage Xiangliu
Fang’s Fiendgod body at all. This caused Ning to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in here.” He
simply stored the entire Fiendgod body into his storage-type magic
treasure. Then, with a wave of his hand, Ning collected the key to
the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly began to
bind it. The key to the Immortal estate was merely a talisman;
binding it was quite simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Northson, Yu
Wei, Ninelotus, and Adept Vastriver just watched as Ning burned the
corpses of Xue Hongyi and Youngflame Nong, then took away all their
magic treasures. All of them were still in a state of shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you, you…you killed Youngflame Nong?”
Northson’s mouth flapped open a few times. He was still speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than ten or so
Zifu Disciples were still alive. They all watched Ning intently,
especially those two female Zifu-level maidservants who served
Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze flickered
past them. Suddenly, the air was filled with sword-ki, which howled
downwards, instantly killing all of the Deathsworn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Deathsworn
remain alive, they would only reveal everything which happened here.”
Ning knew very well that these Deathsworn were completely loyal to
Youngflame Nong. They had watched everything happen; once the
Youngflame clan found these Deathsworn, everything would have been
exposed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninelotus had a look of panic on her face. Tears actually began to
appear. “How could you have killed Youngflame Nong.
This…next…this…the Youngflame clan is definitely going to
pursue and kill you. There’s no way…no way to stop the Youngflame
clan. He was one of the Four Dukelings of the imperial capital of the
Grand Xia Dynasty. He was extremely famous…for the sake of their
reputation alone, the Youngflame clan would spare no expense in
pursuing and killing you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Ninelotus. “I had no choice. I only had two options; to let him
kill me, or to kill him! Either he died or I died. What should I have
done?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was so
frantic, she began to cry. Previously, she had been trying her best
to prevent hatred from developing between Ning and Youngflame Nong,
but in the end…the result was even worse than what she had feared.
Youngflame Nong, the exalted heir-presumptive to the position of
Godplume Duke of the Youngflame clan…had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to panic,”
Ning said with cold calmness. “I killed Youngflame Nong, but I
trust that none of you will voluntarily report me. There’s no way
the Youngflame clan would be able to ascertain, within such a short
period of time, who the killer was. They will need to spend time to
investigate. I’ll immediately send you all out of this Immortal
estate. By then, you can return to your own homes, to the Dongyan
clan and to the Black-White College of Stillwater City. Nothing which
happened here had anything to do with you. I was the killer; the
Youngflame clan won’t act against the rest of you. But by the time
they’ve fully investigated this matter, I’ll have already
arranged an escape plan and executed it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you are wrong.” Yu Wei was frantic and
restless as well, and she said hurriedly, “According to legends,
some extremely powerful figures, such as Celestial Immortals, are
completely capable of causing a temporal inversion, resulting in
scenes from the past being replayed in the present. From this, they
can discover right away that you were the culprit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt his
heart clench.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_27___Traveling_Alone"></A>
Chapter 27 - Traveling Alone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Temporal inversion?”
Ning instantly realized that the situation was far more dire than he
had thought! He had previously believed that after having killed
Youngflame Nong, he would have some time before the Youngflame clan
discovered him, which would allow him to arrange for his clan, the Ji
clan, to escape. But now, it seemed, time was far too tight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, we have no
time. I’ll send you all out now. Go to a safe location. Because of
me, all of you have been implicated.” In order to save time, Ning
began to converse mentally with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Yu Wei sent hurriedly, “You don’t
need to worry about our safety; the Grand Xia Dynasty has its rules,
and the Youngflame clan cannot simply do what it wishes. As long as
we return to the Black-White College, we will be fine; the Grand Xia
Dynasty’s laws state that violence is forbidden within its
commandery cities. In addition, we weren’t the ones to kill
Youngflame Nong, and so the Youngflame clan would have no excuse to
act against us. Right now, you need to worry about yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have two main
options right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first is to
flee. Flee to a place where the Youngflame clan cannot reach you and
take revenge, such as other lesser or major worlds. Another option
would to be to flee straight to the main headquarters of the
Raindragon Guard. The Raindragon Guard remains the most powerful
military force within the Grand Xia Dynasty; no matter how daring the
Youngflame clan is, they wouldn’t dare to act against you while you
are with the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second option is
to go up against them head-on. Go straight to the imperial capital of
the Grand Xia Dynasty; that’s the capital city for the entirety of
the Grand Xia Empire, and the most supreme clans and schools of the
entire Grand Xia Empire reside there. You can first go to the local
Raindragon Guard branch; that place will be absolutely safe.
Afterwards, you can participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
Now that you have mastered a Grand Dao Domain, you will definitely be
able to perform with brilliant splendor at the Conclave. Given your
talent, there will be quite a few powers which will want to draw you
into their fold. By then, you can join a power that is opposed to the
Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
is powerful, but if you look at the Grand Xia Dynasty as a whole,
you’ll still find a few organizations which are more powerful than
them and which hold vast grudges against them. Some of the grudges
can be described as ‘mortal enmity’, and there are more than a
few; after all, in this vast world which the imperial clan of the
Grand Xia Dynasty has unified, it is normal for the largest, most
powerful clans, sects, and churches to have their disputes and
grudges against each other. For example, the ‘Kindwater’ 1 clan
is even more powerful than the Youngflame clan 2, and these two clans
have felt mortal enmity towards each other ever since the Fiendgod
Era. After countless generations of struggle, both sides have even
lost Celestial Immortals. One leader after another has been
assassinated by the other side as well. Given that you’ve killed
Youngflame Nong, powers like the Kindwater clan would definitely be
willing to pull you into their fold. By relying on powerful clans
such as them, you can continue to fight against the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two options; one to
flee, the other to resist. These are the only two ideas I’m able to
come up with in such a short period of time,” Yu Wei sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had previously
been planning on fleeing. He hadn’t expected that Yu Wei would be
able to provide yet another clear path for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan
ranked in the top ten clans of the Grand Xia Dynasty…but that meant
there were nine other clans on par with them! The more powerful an
organization was, the more fights it would get into over resources;
this was extremely common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for your clan,
the Ji clan,” Yu Wei sent hurriedly, “For now, you can have your
clansmen lay low; you can also have some of the elites be sent to
Stillwater City or the imperial capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty.
Murder and fighting is forbidden in commandery cities; if anyone
dares to act in such a way, they will definitely suffer reprisals
from the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
Youngflame clan might be able to arrange for some wanted criminals to
go commit suicide attacks…how powerful could these wanted criminals
possibly be? These wanted criminals are all completely lawless; the
more powerful they are, the less willing they are to do anyone’s
bidding, especially those Fiendgods and Loose Immortals. It will be
very hard for the Youngflame clan to invite those truly terrifying
figures to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only option is
for the Youngflame clan to send its own Loose Immortals out to
annihilate your Ji clan. Even if they escape blame by claiming that
the Loose Immortal did it of his own free will…that Loose Immortal
would definitely die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei continued,
sending mentally, “No matter what, so long as a tribe can save its
elites, in the future, it will flourish again. You are the genius
which the Ji clan has finally produced after countless years; you
need to protect yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning had some plans of his own, but upon
hearing Yu Wei’s suggestions, he instantly felt as though a bigger
picture had been revealed to him, giving him some new ideas as well.
And, Ning also had a feeling…as though Yu Wei seemed to have quite
a clear understanding of the most powerful, supreme forces of the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,”
Ninelotus sent hurriedly, “Come with me. I’ll take you to see the
Forefather and have him send you out from this major world of the
Grand Xia Dynasty. As for the Ji clan, I’ll come up with a way to
protect some of their elites. In the future, when you are more
powerful and come back, we can have the Ji clan flourish again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, are you preparing to flee? I’ll go with you. My
master is close to the end of her life; she’s going to enter her
final, closed-door meditation. She’s already taught me everything
she can. I have nothing holding me back. Going with you and fleeing
together is bound to be an exciting life,” Northson sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, protect yourself; only then will you have
a chance to turn the tables in the future.” Adept Vastriver looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Then,
suddenly…Ning’s gaze fell upon Ninelotus. He sent mentally,
“Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes?” Ninelotus
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I killed Youngflame
Nong. Regardless of whether I choose to flee to another world, or if
I choose to join another supreme clan or alliance…I’ll be unable
to remain within Stillwater Commandery. I’ll be a homeless
wanderer…would you be willing to go with me?” Ning looked towards
Ninelotus, eyes filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Ninelotus
hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She could imagine the
path which Ning would walk down in the future. It would be a path of
incomparable danger. Should she accompany him on that wandering path?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She felt an impulsive
urge to agree. To wander to the edges of the world with Ning, to
share life and death together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But then she thought of
her clan. She was the next leader of the Dongyan clan. She couldn’t
possibly just go wandering off with Ning to the ends of the earth
endlessly. No one could know how long the wandering would last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus.” Ning
could sense her hesitation. He couldn’t help but feel a bit of pain
in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that this
request of his was a bit excessive. Only…in this moment, after
having embarked on this path, Ning truly wanted for someone to walk
it with him. This arduous Immortal path…if someone could share it
with him and share its burdens with him…Ning truly hoped that
someone would be Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’ eyes
filled with tears as she looked at Ning. “Ji Ning, I suddenly
understand now. I simply can’t wander the world by your side; I
can’t share life and death with you. The Forefather’s words were
right. To be Dao-Companions…that means to be willing to die for
someone. Dao-Companions…if Immortals or Buddhas block your path,
for the sake of bringing your Dao-Companion back, you would be
willing to murder Immortals or annihilate Buddhas. But I can’t do
it! I truly can’t do it. I have my own path to follow and I…I
don’t want to give up my own path for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry. I’m
so sorry.” Tears were streaming down Ninelotus’ face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to say
anything further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
glimmering with unshed tears as well. “It’s my fault for being
too greedy. I’m embarking on a path of certain danger, and I’ll
definitely be fighting against the Youngflame clan for countless
years to come. I went too far in what I asked for. I shouldn’t dare
to drag you in and implicate you as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From now on…you
are you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Immortal
path…it’s enough for me to walk it alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed into the
distance. Whoosh! Instantly, a watery, rippling pattern appeared,
followed by a tunnel. Outside the tunnel was the Skyrove Mountains of
the Grand Xia Dynasty’s major world. Ning immediately said, “Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, senior apprentice-brother Vastriver, junior
apprentice-brother Northson, and Ninelotus…you can leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I told you that I’m going to go adventuring
with you. I have nothing holding me back. What the hell do I have to
be afraid of?” Northson spoke with great urgency.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an extremely
dangerous path I am embarking on, junior apprentice-brother
Northson…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I’m
too weak for it?” Northson ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You are too
weak. You can’t help me; instead, you’d slow me down.” Ning
gritted his own teeth as well as he responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Yu Wei spoke
out to urge Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother Northson, don’t
be stubborn; this isn’t the time to show your loyalty. Your
strength truly is a bit too low.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at
Ning, his eyes turning slightly red. “Senior apprentice-brother,
after my mother died, I no longer had any kinsmen left. After I
joined the school, you became the closest person in my life. Long
ago, I started to view you as I would an actual, biological brother.
It is true that I am a bit weak, and I know that you said those word
because you don’t want me to be pulled into this. I’m not going
to say anything else for now, except…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I go back, I’m
going to train hard. And if you die, I’ll definitely take revenge
for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes turned
red. He hadn’t imagined…he truly hadn’t imagined that Northson,
in his heart, viewed Ning as he would a real brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, don’t
worry. I won’t die that easily.” Tears in his eyes, Ning laughed
loudly, then said, “Stop dawdling. Hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus felt all the
more agony in her heart at this moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Northson had been
willing to throw everything away, but her? She truly wanted to do the
same, to throw everything away, to discard her clan, to roam the
world by Ning’s side. But…she continued to hesitate. She just
couldn’t throw it all away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry.”
Tears fell down Ninelotus’ face. “Stay alive. You have to stay
alive.” And then, she turned her head and flew through the corridor
to the Skyrove Mountains on the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, Yu Wei, and
Adept Vastriver all understood. Dao-Companions, Dao-Companions…what
were Dao-Companions? Only those who would never abandon each other,
even at their most critical moments, could be considered
Dao-Companions. Ninelotus’ departure, and the words she had just
spoken…they caused the three to understand that in the future, most
likely Ji Ning and Ninelotus would truly embark on completely
separate Immortal paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,”
Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay alive.” Yu
Wei looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to stay
alive,” Adept Vastriver instructed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the three
flew through the corridor, arriving within the Skyrove Mountains. The
corridor then shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skyrove Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had returned to
the world of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Ninelotus, Yu Wei, Northson, and
Adept Vastriver all turned their heads to stare at the corridor.
Through it, they could vaguely make out that solitary, lonely figure
within the main hall on the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From today on…Ning
was going to have to fight by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus stared
through the tunnel. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t stop
her tears from continuing to fall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The choice she had made
today was an incomparably agonizing choice for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She wasn’t able to
abandon her tribe. She had her own dreams. She simply couldn’t make
herself discard everything for Ning’s sake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Northson, and
Adept Vastriver didn’t say anything. This was because they, too,
understood how rare it was for there to be a pair of Dao-Companions
who would truly share life and death together, who would never leave
each other, and whose lives would become as one. In fact, many
so-called Dao-Companions would actually end up hating each other and
becoming enemies; it wasn’t uncommon for them to end up fighting
over treasures and killing each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To truly be together
until death parted them…this was far too rare. Ninelotus had too
many other things she cared about. She couldn’t throw them all
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The corridor
swung shut, and they could no longer see to the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Northson gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going back to
my clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus returned by
herself to the Dongyan clan, while Northson, Adept Vastriver, and Yu
Wei returned to the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
I shall traverse my Immortal path alone. It’s for the best,
actually. By myself, I’ll be much more carefree,” Ning said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you still
have us.” Little Qing raised her serpentine head and called out to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards the
Azure Skysnake, then towards Uncle White, who had followed him
silently this entire time. He felt a warm feeling in his heart.
“Right. I still have you two. Little Qing, Uncle White, let’s go.
Let’s go and meet the monsters of this Immortal estate.”

Chapter 28 - The Thousand Year Pact
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clan commanded by
Immortal Witchsui, along with the many Seawave Dao-soldiers commanded
by Immortal Duohe, continued to wait on the outside of the fifth
palace. Although they were enraged and despairing, they still
hoped…hoped that a miracle might occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monster clans.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out, and along with it, waves of divine will
rolled out, instantly encompassing all of the monstrous Dao-soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” All of the
monsters looked over. Even Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe were
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few hundred
kilometers away, there was a fur-clad youth, with a little azure
serpent coiled around his arm and a large, snowy white dog by his
side. In the air around them hovered ancient, plain, unadorned wooden
sticks. It was the Fuxi Staff Formation; space within a hundred
kilometers of that human was completely locked, and there would be no
way to teleport inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Immortal
Witchsui and Immortal Duohe immediately recognized him. Amongst the
group of humans, there was indeed a fur-clad human who had a giant
snowy white dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The key to the
Immortal estate is now in my hands.” Ning’s voice rang out by the
ears of every single monster. His divine sense had spread to a
thousand kilometers; naturally, he was able to send his voice to each
and every one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held the key to
the Immortal estate in his hands. He sent his will forth, and next to
him a corridor appeared; it was the corridor to the Skyrove Mountains
in the outside world. Actually, just now, Ning had already used the
key to leave and go to the Skyrove Mountains, then re-entered, having
Little Qing lead him and Uncle White in a teleportation. Little Qing
was actually far more powerful now than she had been in the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains; for near-distance blinks, she could
bring others along with her. The main thing was that Ning had yet to
bind the various branches; if he emerged directly from within the
Witchriver Palace, he would have been surrounded by the monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The key to the
Immortal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is holding the
key to the Immortal estate in his hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the outside
world, the smell of the outside world.” Immortal Witchsui and
Immortal Duohe swept forward with their divine senses, and were even
able to extend them into the corridor leading to the outside world.
“That’s another world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchsui,
Immortal Duohe, and the many monsters all stared towards Ning with
even more blazingly desirous gazes. Although they were suspicious as
to why the other human was no longer holding the key, the truth
remained that this man before them was holding it now. They couldn’t
be bothered to over-analyze it; they knew that the appearance of this
youth represented a desire by this youth to negotiate with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchsui and
Immortal Duohe were actually considering whether or not they should
try to seize the key to the Immortal estate. However, their earlier,
repeated failures caused them to no longer dare to act rashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t try
anything. I’ve already set up a formation around me, and the
corridor is already open; I can leave at any time. In addition, even
if you truly were to attack, you wouldn’t be able to kill me,”
Ning said. He had that other protective magic treasure, and also the
magic treasures which Youngflame Nong had left behind. His words were
completely true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchsui and
Immortal Duohe, as well as the other monsters, all calmed down. They
no longer dared to make any more gambles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you want?”
Immotal Witchsui asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I offended a
powerful a tribe, the Youngflame clan, and the clan is going to come
act against me. They might even act against my tribe.” Ning’s
divine sense was sending a message to every single monster. “My
tribe is located in a commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the
City of Ten Thousand Swords. I wish for you, the monsters of this
Immortal estate world, to go to the City of Ten Thousand Swords and
protect my tribe. Protect them for a thousand years; after that
period of time, I’ll release you and give you your freedom. As for
the key to the Immortal estate? I can just give it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The key to the Immortal
estate wasn’t of much use to Ning. There was no way he could carry
the Witchriver Immortal Estate with him; what was he supposed to do
with it? In addition, he had the underwater estate, an even finer
estate left behind by Daoist Threelives. As for the treasures within
the Witchriver Immortal Estate? The Dao Repository and the Treasure
Vault had already been looted clean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect them for a
thousand years?” Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe, along with
the tens of thousands of monsters, were both amazed and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although a thousand
years was a fairly long period of time, monsters had extremely long
lifespans to begin with. To simply protect a tribe for a thousand
years…they would then be able to go to the wider, vast world. They
would even receive the key to the Immortal estate. They didn’t even
dare to imagine something like this previously. They had been
preparing to be fleeced, and had even been willing to hand over part
of their Dao-armors as their offer for peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had no desire
for the Dao-armors; wearing the Dao-armors, these monsters would be
ten times or even tens of times more powerful. That was what he
wanted; them to be powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your tribe is
located in the ‘City of Ten Thousand Swords’ of the Grand Xia
Dynasty? Based on what I know, the Grand Xia Dynasty is extremely
strict in its prohibition against battles within commandery cities.
If anyone dares to fight within one, they will suffer pursuit and
apprehension by the Grand Xia Dynasty. This ‘Youngflame’ clan
that wishes to act against your tribe, they shouldn’t dare to
actually attack your city, should they?” Immortal Duohe asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
always been trapped within here, they had passed down records
regarding the Grand Xia Dynasty’s world from generation to
generation, and so they knew some of the most basic things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct, they won’t
dare to launch an actual attack. However, if they were to send some
wanted criminals or some Deathsworn to attack my tribe…” Ning
sent to them, “These criminals and Deathsworn would most likely be
at the Wanxiang level or the Primal Daoist level. Loose Immortals?
The chances of there being one of them should be very, very low.
Celestial Immortals? That’s even less likely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To enter a commandery
city of the Grand Xia Dynasty and launch an attack was a challenge
and affront to the entire Dynasty. Anyone who did so would be killed
without question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
Youngflame Nong, who was already dead…would they really be willing
to sacrifice a Loose Immortal, just for the sake of giving vent to
their rage and killing a backwater tribe? The chances were quite low.
As for sacrificing a Celestial Immortal? That was virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that every single Celestial Immortal was considered one of the true
foundations for a clan. A single word from a Celestial Immortal could
even cause the clan leader to be changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning were to become
a Celestial Immortal, he would become one of the figures capable of
influencing the entire Grand Xia Dynasty; even the entire Youngflame
clan would treat him with courtesy. If it had been a Celestial
Immortal who had killed Youngflame Nong, most likely the Youngflame
clan would just go negotiate with him, rather than pursue and attack
him. Thus, there was no way the Youngflame clan would be so stupid as
to send a Celestial Immortal into a commandery city and begin a
slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We know a little bit
about the Grand Xia Empire’s world. It is already incredible for
the supreme clans to have even just one or two Celestial Immortals;
there is no way they would let them end up as wanted criminals.”
Immortal Duohe and Witchsui exchanged a glance, then made up their
minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have decided to
agree to your request. For a thousand years, we shall be stationed at
that commandery city of the Grand Xia Empire, the ‘City of Ten
Thousand Swords’, and protect your clan. Given our power, even if
supreme Loose Immortals come, we should be able to easily defeat
them. However, if a Celestial Immortal comes, there is nothing we can
do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If a Celestial
Immortal attacks, I’ll just accept it,” Ning sent. “Monsters,
all of you need to now swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. I
shall do the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s how it
should be done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters were
indeed afraid that Ning would later go back on his word; it was best
if they all swore oaths to the Dao of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, with Ning
personally choosing the words to the oaths, both came to an agreement
on what to say, then swore the oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands of
monsters simultaneously swore an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.
Ripples of power from the Dao of the Heavens descended upon them, and
through his divine sense, Ning could clearly see every single monster
making the oath. These thirty thousand-plus monsters were the elites
of this entire Immortal estate world; more than ninety nine percent
of the Diremonster Immortal cultivators were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oaths to the Dao of the
Heavens were useless against mortals and useless against ordinary
monsters, but upon monsters or humans embarking upon the Immortal
path, it would have tremendous effect! These monstrous Dao-soldiers
were all at the Zifu level at the very least. The thirty
thousand-plus monsters, along with two Loose Immortals, all swore
their oaths to the Dao of the Heavens, and Ning, in turn, was no
longer worried about them going back on their word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, he swore an
oath as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no time to
waste,” Ning sent mentally. “That expert from the Youngflame clan
might even be a Celestial Immortal, and he will soon reach the
Witchriver Immortal Estate. Once he comes, he might annihilate all of
you. We need to immediately leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Immortal
Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and the others were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Immortals were
quite decisive; in the face of an opportunity that would change the
destinies of all the monsters in the Immortal estate world, they
immediately ordered the necessary arrangements be made. “Daoist
Zhenbao, Daoist Witchaxle, each of you go lead a thousand
Dao-soldiers and gather all of our clansmen within the Immortal
estate world, then lead them to the City of Ten Thousand Swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a map of the
Stillwater Commandery of the Grand Xia Empire. There is a mark here
for the City of Ten Thousand Swords.” Ning flew over as well. Given
that they had all sworn oaths to the Dao of the Heavens, they were
naturally now in the same boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll lead these
soldiers to head there right away,” Immortal Witchsui and Immortal
Duohe both said. “Everyone, get in.” The two Immortals each
produced a giant sack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single one of the
many monstrous Dao-soldiers resisted. All of them allowed themselves
to be drawn into the sacks, leaving behind just Immortal Zhenbao,
Immortal Witchaxle, and the two thousand Dao-soldiers under their
command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A corridor
appeared, leading to the Skyrove Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Immortal
Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and Daoist Witchaxle all flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They appeared within
the gorge in the Skyrove Mountains. Even the aura and the smell here
was different compared to the Immortal estate world; this was an aura
of a vast, endless world, the smell of an entire, major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s different.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is
different.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Grand
Xia Dynasty’s world.” Immortal Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and the
others were all stunned and excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the key to
the Immortal estate.” Ning handed the key directly to Daoist
Witchaxle. “I’m giving it to you now. Immediately lead the
remaining monsters to quickly depart from the Immortal estate world;
if you delay, the situation might change.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daoist
Witchaxle accepted the key, then immediately generated a corridor,
returning to the Immortal estate and then shutting the corridor off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said. “The City of Ten Thousand Swords is six hundred thousand
kilometers to the north.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Duohe, that
powerful old fellow, personally executed a teleportation, bringing
Immortal Witchsui, Ning, Little Qing, and Uncle White with him in a
long-distance teleport.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning realized that the
surrounding environment had changed. He took a careful look, then
said, “We were slightly off; the City of Ten Thousand Swords is
roughly twenty six thousand kilometers to our southeast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll just
teleport us again.” The shorter the distance, the easier a
teleportation was. Immortal Duohe easily teleported them a short
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the middle of the
air, surrounded by clouds, at a location just a few hundred
kilometers outside the City of Ten Thousand Swords. A spatial ripple
appeared, then from within it emerged Immortal Duohe, Immortal
Witchsui, and a fur-clad youth, a little azure serpent, and a large,
snowy white hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.” Ning
stared towards the distance. His Fiendgod-like eyesight could easily
see the distant commandery city, just a few hundred kilometers away.
This caused Ning to let out a sigh of relief; previously, when he had
been chatting with the monsters in the Immortal estate, he had done
so through divine sense, so as to save as much time as possible. He
had been worried about taking too much time and unforseen things
happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed towards
the distant commandery city. “That city is the City of Ten Thousand
Swords, the city which the monster clans of the Immortal estate must
protect for a thousand years.”

Chapter 29 - Patriarch Arcanum
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the City of Ten
Thousand Swords. Inside a large, secluded, palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? A tribe even
more powerful than the Northmont clan of Stillwater?” Ji Ninefire,
Ji Truekeep, and Granny Shadow were completely petrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Immortal
Duohe, while this is Immortal Witchsui; both are extremely powerful
Loose Immortals.” After describing the dangerous situation, Ji Ning
moved to introduce the two by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loose Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninfire and the others
felt dazed. Legendary, exalted Loose Immortals were before them…and
two of them at that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They will command
thirty thousand monstrous Dao-soldiers to protect our City of Ten
Thousand Swords,” Ning said. “They are all wearing Dao-armors,
and so with these two Loose Immortals in command of thirty thousand
monstrous Dao-soldiers…even if tens of Loose Immortals come, they
should be able to withstand them. They will protect our city for a
thousand years. Unless a Celestial Immortal or someone with a
Celestial Immortal’s power attacks us, our city should be
completely safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Truekeep, and
Granny Shadow were cultivators, after all; despite still being
stunned, they quickly regained their equilibrium.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You three can decide
what arrangements need to be made for the tribe,” Ning said. “You
know more about these things than me anyhow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Truekeep nodded. “With such a powerful army of Dao-soldiers
stationed here, and with this being a commandery city of the Grand
Xia Empire that is under special protection from the Raindragon Guard
as well…anyone who dares attack will be pursued throughout the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty! No matter how powerful the Youngflame clan
is, they wouldn’t possibly be willing to have one of their
legendary Celestial Immortals become a wanted criminal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
were figures of legends. It wasn’t even known for certain whether
or not the Northmont clan of Stillwater had a Celestial Immortal. As
for the Black-White College, in its countless years of existence, it
had produced countless Loose Immortals, but only a single Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing, Uncle
White, the two of you shall stay here for now. Here is a talisman.”
Ning handed a talisman to the human-shaped Uncle White. “If you
notice that the talisman has shattered, then teleport directly
towards Serpentwing Lake and reunite with me. If the talisman remains
whole, then you are absolutely not permitted to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Little
Qing and Uncle White both nodded. At a critical moment like this,
they wouldn’t let him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, be
careful,” Uncle White instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll leave now.
After this departure, I probably won’t be able to return for a very
long period of time.” Ning looked towards Ninefire, Truekeep, and
Granny shadow. “It was I who brought this calamity upon the tribe.
In the future, I’ll make up for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t say such
things!” Ninefire scolded in a low voice. “Remember, you have to
protect yourself. Only if you are alive shall our Ji clan have a
chance to flourish.” For a tribe to produce a genius like Ning was
completely a matter of luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m leaving now.”
Ning immediately used a Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal. Whoosh. He
disappeared from within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above
Brightheart Island of Serpentwing Lake. A ripple in the air could be
seen, and then Ning emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf.” Upon
landing, Ning immediately sent his voice out, calling towards Autumn
Leaf. Soon, a light gray-robed Autumn Leaf emerged. She looked at
Ning in surprise and delight. “Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can no longer
stay on Brightheart Island. Hurry up and have everyone on the island
move away to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. As for you, you need to
leave immediately,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
stunned. “What, what happened?” Brightheart Island had long ago
become her home; she had poured her heart out in developing this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t ask. I don’t
have time to explain in detail. When you arrive in the City of Ten
Thousand Swords, you can ask Uncle White and the others, and they
will let you know. Right now, you need to make the arrangements right
away, then immediately leave. This is a Lesser Teleportation
Dao-seal; you can use it to teleport up to ten thousand kilometers
away. Teleport straight to the city.” Ning handed her a Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf immediately
understood how grave the situation was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, even if a
Celestial Immortal of the Youngflame clan was to personally
investigate, he would have to first go into the Witchriver Immortal
Estate, find the ‘Witchriver Palace’ in which Youngflame Nong had
been killed, then utilize a temporal inversion technique. Even if,
through the usage of such a technique, he discovered that Ning was
the killer, he would probably need a bit of time before finding out
about Ning’s background.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire process
would take time, and in truth, by the time that Celestial Immortal
might have made his way to Swallow Mountain, much time would have
passed. And even if he came, he wouldn’t recognize Autumn Leaf, nor
know about the relationship between her and Ning; thus, there was
absolutely no need at all for Autumn Leaf to use the Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seal. Ning, however, was uneasy. In order to
prevent any unknown variables from arising, he thus instructed Autumn
Leaf to use the Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making the
arrangements, Autumn Leaf, per Ning’s request, was forced to use
this Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief. “Alright.” He pushed open the door to the
private room he normally stayed in, entered, then shut the door. With
but a thought, he caused the illusion of a giant grizzly head to
appear within the room. The grizzly head swallowed Ning within its
mouth, and Ning disappeared from Serpentwing Lake, entering the
underwater estate in another world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia Dynasty. This was the administrative heart of this
entire major world. There were many Loose Immortals and Primal
Daoists here, as well as various supreme tribes, schools, and sects
as well! In fact, even some of the most powerful forces from other
major worlds would arrange for spies and intelligence agents to be
placed here. This was truly a place where the fish swam with the
dragons. Immortals were as common as the clouds, and unfathomable in
their power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan’s
estate in this place took up a thousand kilometers. It was
incomparably luxurious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet study
inside their estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden-robed man with
a crown on his head was seated before a desk, reading various
intelligence reports. He was the leader of the Youngflame clan, the
current Godplume Duke!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kindwater clan
is becoming increasingly excessive in their actions!” The
golden-robed man frowned and muttered to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader, clan
leader.” Suddenly, a panicked voice rang out. Upon hearing this
voice, the golden-robed man’s face sunk. He hated it when his
subordinates lost their bearings and grew panicked. However, this
particular subordinate was his personal attendant, and one who should
have known the rules.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door was pushed
open, and a middle-aged man dressed in blue robes charged in, then
knelt down and said in sobbing voice, “Clan leader, young master
Youngflame Nong, he, he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong?
What about him?” The golden-robed man frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He died!” The
blue-robed middle-aged servant spoke out in a terrified, frantic
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
golden-robed man rose to his feet, revealing a look of astonishment.
“How did he die? How do you know he died? You can’t say such
things unless you are absolutely certain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His life-tablet in
the ancestral hall has shattered,” the blue-robed servant called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed man
stood there in the study. After a few moments of silence, he said in
a low voice, “Investigate. Send out my orders; within the time
needed to boil a kettle of tea, Youngflame Nong’s whereabouts needs
to be discovered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
blue-robed servant said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong
actually died? He should have gone to the Witchriver Immortal Estate.
How could he have died? Even if he wasn’t able to bind the
Witchriver Immortal Estate, he had a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal
on him…even within the Immortal estate, he would’ve been able to
teleport out to the Grand Xia Dynasty’s world. And he had that
Fiendgod with him, Xiangliu Fang.” The golden-robed man was
pondering to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong was one
of his juniors; they weren’t exactly on close terms with each
other, and in fact, he didn’t really like Youngflame Nong. But
Youngflame Nong had a Celestial Immortal supporting him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although on the
surface, the most powerful figure in a clan was its titular clan
leader, compared to the Celestial Immortals who were the Patriarchs
of the clan, the clan leader was far inferior. These Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs who had lived countless years were the true
foundation of a clan. The birth of every Celestial Immortal would
cause the entire clan to celebrate, and the fall of every Celestial
Immortal would be hidden for as long as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why no one was
certain as to how many Celestial Immortals a clan had. For example,
the Northmont clan of Stillwater; did it have any surviving Celestial
Immortals or not? This was a mystery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How many Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs did the Youngflame clan have? This, too, was a
mystery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Godplume Duke
himself only knew of three Celestial Immortal Patriarchs within the
clan; as for Youngflame Nong, he only knew of one! But even the
Godplume Duke wasn’t certain as to exactly how many Celestial
Immortals his clan had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” The
blue-robed servant returned, saying hurriedly with respect, “Three
days ago, Young master Youngflame Nong used a teleportation array to
go to Stillwater Commandery, then headed towards the Witchriver
Immortal Estate. I’m not capable of locating the exact location of
the estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
golden-robed man nodded. “I need to go on a visit. For now, you are
not to inform any outsiders of Youngflame Nong’s death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, nine golden Flood
Dragons, pulling an Immortal carriage behind them, soared out from
within the Youngflame clan’s estate. They howled through the air,
departing from the imperial capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty and
entering the azure void of the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the peak of a tall
volcano which stretched through the clouds. The nine golden Flood
Dragons, pulling the Immortal carriage, descended from the skies,
then flew into the mouth of the volcano. The last time this volcano
had erupted was hundreds of thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to fly
down through the opening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bubbling streams of
lava could be seen in the depths below. In the center of the lava
flows, a towering, red-haired giant could be seen, reclining in the
lava. This red-haired giant lay there as though lying within a
personal bathtub. His head was supported by a ‘pillow’ of stone,
and his feet pressed against another stone. His eyes were even larger
than the Immortal carriage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Bafire.”
The golden-robed man stood in front of the Immortal carriage and
called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
red-haired giant opened his eyes and looked at the golden-robed man.
After pondering a moment, he said slowly, “You are…Youngflame
Fujun, the current clan leader and Godplume Duke?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am.” The
golden-robed man was still quite humble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because he
knew who the Fiendgod in front of him was. This Fiendgod was surnamed
Bafire, and was an incomparably powerful warrior who had belonged to
an extremely mighty Fiendgod tribe, back in the Fiendgod Era. He was
a Void-level Fiendgod! However, although he was ‘only’ a
Void-level Fiendgod, his true combat power was absolutely on the
level of Celestial Immortals. In the past, it had been one of the
most brilliant, outstanding Patriarchs of the Youngflame clan who had
subdued and tamed him. Unfortunately, that Patriarch had already
fallen over the passage of countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
red-haired giant asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are the three
Patriarchs still within this major world?” The golden-robed man
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired giant
said slowly, “Patriarch Infatuation left this major world more than
ten thousand years ago. Where he went, and when he shall return…is
unknown. Patriarch Sunfish, just a few decades, went to meet with
friends in the Deva realm; generally speaking, he will spend a
century in the Deva realm when meeting with friends. Only Patriarch
Arcanum remains here, in secluded meditation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong just
died. This is a matter of grave import; I’d like to trouble you,
senior Bafire, to make a report to Patriarch Arcanum,” the
golden-robed man said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong? The
next clan leader of your clan?” The red-haired giant laughed. “Your
next clan leader actually died? What a joke. I’ll go help you make
the report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired giant
closed his eyes. Moments later, he opened them again. “Patriarch
Arcanum will arrive right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The location of the
place where Patriarch Arcanum was secluded was a mystery; only some
of Patriarch Arcanum’s closest confidantes knew. Not even the
Godplume Duke knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
lava, spots of stellar light suddenly appeared. The brilliant spots
of stellar light began to link together, seemingly forming a
mysterious, arcane formation. Suddenly, a tall, skinny, narrow-eyed
elder stepped out from within that swirl of countless stars. In this
moment, it seemed as though the entire world was bowing towards him,
as though he and he alone was the only master of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Arcanum.”
The golden-robed man hurriedly bowed with respect.
