Chapter 1 - Solesky Begs For Aid
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the river
gurgled gently. Both sides of the riverbank were verdant green and
filled with flowers of all colors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Two
figures descended from the skies. Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord
stood there amongst the wild flowers and shrubbery. The Ninedust
Sectlord sighed in amazement, “I never would’ve imagined that the
Waveshift Realm would hold such beautiful scenery within it. Everyone
speaks of how dangerous the realm is. Can such beauty truly hold
danger within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Waveshift
was a truly extraordinary Emperor,” Ning immediately said. “The
dangers within the Waveshift Realm are hidden and invisible. Don’t
be fooled by how beautiful the flowers are; if you dare to run around
recklessly, you’ll end up trapped in some truly dangerous places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really?!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
chuckled. “Haha. Don’t worry, we’re in the outermost perimeter
of the Waveshift Realm right now. Even if there is any danger here,
we should be able to endure it with ease. Come, let us follow this
river and move into the core regions of the Waveshift Realm as soon
as possible.” As he spoke, he began to walk towards the banks of
the river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we going to
follow the river?” The Ninedust Sectlord followed behind Ning,
feeling quite puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we’re going
to follow it. It’ll be safer this way.” Ning didn’t explain
further, because this was something he had learned from big brother
Solesky. Clearly, Daolord Badlands had been able to use Numerancy to
divine certain secrets here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Waveshift Realm
has ten layers to it; seven outer layers and three inner layers.”
Ning continued to explain as they advanced. “The three inner layers
can be considered the ‘core’ region, and that is where the
Voidsea Jadeseals should be. We should move to the core regions as
quickly as possible, but we’ll encounter quite a few dangers along
the way. Both of us need to be careful and maintain a vigilant watch
at all times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning released his
heartworld projection, using it to cover an area of ten thousand
kilometers around him. However, he controlled it to ensure that it
didn’t launch any attacks, keeping it in sensory mode. The
heartworld projection was much more effective as a scanning method
than heartforce or godsense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift Realm was
simply enormous. In the blink of an eye, the two ended up spending
more than two hundred years walking through it without reaching the
three innermost regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth?”
A voice rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were at the peak
of a snowy white mountain. The two were crossing the mountain peak
when they suddenly saw six figures appear off in the distance, with
the leader being a dazzling beauty dressed in faint pink Daoist
robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Daolord
Qianfei?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a coincidence.
I didn’t expect to run into you here, Daolord Darknorth. Have you
seen Daolord Solesky?” Daolord Qianfei asked from afar. She glanced
sideways at the nearby Ninedust, but didn’t pay him much attention.
Ninedust was not nearly as well-known as Ning. Perhaps many people
knew the previous Ninedust Sectlord, but very, very few knew the new
one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky?
If I did, I’d probably be travelling with him,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the two spoke, they
slowly moved closer and closer to each other. Swoosh. The two sides
crossed paths then moved past each other, both sides continuing to
stare intently and prepared to attack at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew just how
tough to deal with this squad of six Daolords would be. Daolord
Qianfei looked like a woman but was actually male. S/he was a special
lifeform that was skilled in the usage of poison! As for the five
other Daolords by her side, all of them were on par with her. All six
of them were second-tier Daolords! Six second-tier Daolords… when
they joined forces, they were definitely a powerful force to be
reckoned with who could give even the most elite of Daolords a good
fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate this Darknorth fellow. His companion probably is also
quite strong.” Daolord Qianfei didn’t wish to fight the two of
them either. Soon, the two sides moved far away from each other as
they continued their respective journeys.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a relieved sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s there to be
afraid of? If we really ended up in a fight, I’d wipe them out by
myself,” the Ninedust Sectlord boasted confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really?” Ning
glanced sideways at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust chortled
awkwardly. “Honestly, if I ran into them in the outside world I
really would want to give them a good fight. But as for right now,
well… we’re in the seventh layer of the Waveshift Realm. If we
can avoid a fight, that’d be for the best.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
snowy mountains up ahead of them. He couldn’t help but sigh. Just a
short while ago, they had been careless and ended up falling into a
trap. They had wasted three years before being able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift Realm was
divided up into ten layers; seven outer layers, three core layers.
The seventh layer was already quite close to the core region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of the Daolords
who run into each other dare to launch rash attacks. All of us are
nervous and jumpy. This really is exhausting.” The Ninedust
Sectlord pursed his lips. “Running the math through my head, we
have to have run into over a hundred squads of Daolords in the
Waveshift Realm by now. Some were strong, some were weak, but none of
them were willing to get into a real fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just wait and see
what happens when the Voidsea Jadeseals actually show up. You’ll
see for yourself if anyone holds back when that happens,” Ning
said. “Everyone’s just biding their time, that’s all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning’s face
turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!
Darknorth! Rendezvous with me as soon as possible. Quickly, quickly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky’s
avatar within Vastheaven Palace was beginning Ning to save him, going
so far as to give a detailed description of his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move!”
Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
The Ninedust Sectlord was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My big brother
Solesky is in serious danger. We need to move there right away. This
is the first time he’s asked me for aid since we’ve entered the
Waveshift Realm!” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha! So that big
brother Solesky of yours has finally agreed to meet up with us?”
Ninedust laughed. Although Solesky treated Ning as he would a
brother, everyone was here for the sake of acquiring a Voidsea
Jadeseal! If the two joined together but then ran into one of them,
who would it end up belonging to? Ning would want it, Solesky would
want it, and the Ninedust Sectlord would also want it! Of the three,
Ninedust was easily the most powerful! This was why Daolord Solesky
had been in no rush to join forces with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t the
time for jokes,” Ning said seriously. “Let’s move as fast as we
can. If we move too slowly, we might not make it in time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic. If
you panic, you might be careless and fall into a dangerous zone and
be trapped there for a century. If that happens, you really won’t
make it in time,” Ninedust warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” The two
of them hurriedly pressed onwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth layer of the
Waveshift Realm. There was a sandy beach here, and a ragged-looking
old man was standing on the beach with an ugly look on his face. Next
to him was the azure-robed Daolord Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you won’t
be able to escape.” Standing far off in the distance was a group of
three, with the leader being a willowy woman dressed in loose black
robes. Her skin was green while her eyes were crimson, and she had a
pair of curved green horns on her head. She was the seventh ranked
Daolord of the Endless Territories, Fiendqueen Dustrain. The two
partners next to her were slightly weaker, but both were second-tier
Daolords. They were Daolord Incense Dragon and Daolord Feiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky, be a good
boy and tell me everything you know.” Fiendqueen Dustrain’s voice
was cold and clear. “Otherwise, I’ll capture you and torture you
until you die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dustrain? The two of
us really do run into each other quite often.” Daolord Badlands’
avatar smiled coldly. “Last time, you threatened me in front of my
Badlands Court. I didn’t expect I’d run into you again here in
the Waveshift Realm. Catch us if you can!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s see
what you have.” Solesky ground his teeth as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two stood there
atop the beach, which seemed quite ordinary, but in truth they were
surrounded by thirteen ancient linked formations. This was an
incredibly dangerous place they had discovered some time ago but had
been afraid to enter! Alas, when they ran into Fiendqueen Dustrain
they had no choice but to flee into the formations as soon as
possible. Now that they were trapped inside, escape would be quite
difficult! Still, hiding within the formation was still better than
being caught by the Fiendqueen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A murderous
look flickered through the Fiendqueen’s eyes. “Damn those two.
Incense Dragon, do you have any ideas on how to get inside?” the
Fiendqueen sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They seem to be
inside thirteen looped formations that are constantly changing. The
only reason they were able to make it safely inside was because of
how skilled Daolord Badlands is in divination.” Daolord Incense
Dragon shook his head. “It’ll be very hard for us to enter.
Although I’m skilled in formations, I’m not capable of defeating
this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there’s nothing
you can do?” The Fiendqueen was angered by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing I
can do.” Daolord Incense Dragon shook his head again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendqueen’s
crimson eyes were filled with a crazed look. She barked coldly,
“Solesky, I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over everything you
know about the Waveshift Realm! If you dare to refuse me again, I vow
that you will regret it!” But neither Solesky nor Badlands budged
in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Fine!” The
Fiendqueen’s body began to faintly emanate a black mist as an aura
of power and majesty swept out from her, causing all of the Daolords
present to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Emperor
Waveshift was skilled in Numerancy, he was not a Hegemon. Even if was
in front of me right now and attacked me, he still wouldn’t be that
much stronger than me. I refuse to believe his formations can be all
that powerful! I’ll break through them with raw power. BREAK!!!”
The Fiendqueen’s voice was filled with madness as her two
crystalline hands suddenly expanded in size, crashing down towards
Solesky and Badlands like a pair of giant mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Instantly,
streams of light appeared atop the sandy beach as the ancient
formations showed themselves, blocking the dominating power of these
two hands.

Chapter 2 - Fiendqueen Dustrain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous sound rang
out. The great beach seemed to sway, as did the waters of the sea
behind it. The light of the ancient formation covering the beach
shuddered as well, but it managed to endure the hit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It survived the
blow.” Solesky and Badlands both revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
this formation can stop me.” Fiendqueen Dustrain was only maddened
even further by this, and her crystalline hands glowed with endless
dark light as she once more struck out towards the formations with
blows of incredible weight. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! She struck out
repeatedly like a madwoman, a terrifying look in her eyes as she
attacked nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This spectacle caused
the two Daolords by her sides to exchange glances, their faces
turning pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Solesky and
Badlands, they were incredibly nervous despite being protected by the
formations. Even the most powerful and marvelous of formations could
be defeated by a single method - overwhelming power! Once the power
of your attacks reached a sufficient level, you’d be able to level
any formations in your path! Fiendqueen Dustrain was the seventh most
powerful Daolord of the Endless Territories, and she truly was
unspeakably powerful! When she struck out repeatedly with such power
as this, even most ordinary Eternal Emperors would be smashed to
death by her blows!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, die, DIE!”
The Fiendqueen grew increasingly berserk and her attacks actually
grew increasingly powerful. The formations were already shuddering
under her assaults. Now, they quickly began to reach the brink of
collapse as the outermost formation’s runes began to crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move!”
Daolord Badlands, seeing the situation, sent his friend a furious
mental message. “Do what I planned out earlier. Let’s move, now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
Daolord Solesky waved his hand, putting away Daolord Badlands’
avatar. Just as the formation began to break apart, he transformed
into an endless stream of water that quickly fled off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to flee?”
The Fiendqueen’s gaze turned even colder. She waved her crystalline
right hand, sending an unearthly amount of power out with her attack.
BOOM! The already-shuddering formation was finally, completely
destroyed. Her hand swept towards the fleeing stream of water, and
the water touched by that hand was all completely extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the stream of
water split up into countless rivulets that furiously fled in every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky’s
life-preserving abilities aren’t bad at all.” The Fiendqueen let
out a cold laugh as she flickered through the skies, striking out
with both hands in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was
famous for his fleeing and life-preserving abilities. He was on the
same level as Patriarch Clearwind, but his attacks weren’t that
strong! His fleeing abilities, however, vastly surpass Clearwind’s,
especially his self-created ‘invulnerable aquaform’. Although it
wasn’t as perfect and as powerful as that of the Ninedust Sectlord,
it shared some of its mysteries and abilities. To kill Daolord
Solesky would be fairly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because she knew how good Solesky was at staying alive that the
Fiendqueen dared to attack in such a wild manner. Otherwise, her goal
would’ve been to capture him with weaker attacks so that she could
force him to hand over his information.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky fled in
front of the group of three, which chased after him in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The endless
streams of water suddenly burrowed into a grove of trees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another formation!”
The black mist roiled around the Fiendqueen as her face turned grim
with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on in, if you
dare!” The water within the forest reformed into a humanoid shape.
It was Daolord Solesky, but his face was rather ashen and his aura
was noticeably weaker than before. However, he still refused to bend
the knee. “Fiendqueen Dustrain, come break this formation if you
are strong enough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky waved
his hand, causing Daolord Badlands’ avatar to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you alright,
brother Solesky?” Daolord Badlands hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen Dustrain
is far too powerful. Normally, Daolords who are one level of power
above me are unable to harm me, but she’s overwhelmingly stronger
than me. In the end, my ‘invulnerable aquaform’ isn’t perfect
enough.” Daolord Solesky shook his head. “Roughly 70% of my
divine body was wiped out. I can use chaos jewels to rebuild it, but
my soul and truesoul were both heavily wounded. It’ll take me at
least a century to recover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A century?”
Daolord Badlands frowned as well. Countless Daolords had entered
after the Voidsea Jadeseals had announced their presence. Ever since
then, they had lived miserable lives, because every single squad of
Daolords they ran into would furiously chase after them! Given that
the Waveshift Realm was quite dangerous to begin with, even someone
as skilled in Numerancy as Daolord Badlands was still unable to
ensure that they could avoid all trouble. They had repeatedly fallen
into dangerous situations, with this one being the worst thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands only
had his avatar present, and it was very weak. If Daolord Solesky had
now been injured so heavily as to need a century to recover, they
were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The enraged
Fiendqueen began to once more launch attacks upon the formation from
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands, are you
sure she cannot break this formation?” Daolord Solesky was rather
worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, this
formation uses this forest as its foundation and is far more stable
than the previous one.” Daolord Badlands was quite confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break for
me!” The Fiendqueen launched repeated palm attacks. Her hands were
beautifully and as pale as jewels, but they contained terrifying
amounts of power. Each time she attacked the forest, runes would
appear and flicker above it as the forest resisted her attack.
Although the formations were shaking slightly, they still remained
quite stable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen, it’ll
probably be quite difficult if you wish to destroy this formation
through raw power,” the nearby Daolord Incense Dragon said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it is much
tougher to deal with than the previous one.” A layer of frost
seemed to be on the Fiendqueen’s face. “They clearly know much
more about the Waveshift Realm than we do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some formations could
be destroyed through raw force, but some were too strong and could
not be! For example, the one that had trapped Ning and Ninedust was
too strong. It had taken them three years before they worked out the
formation and managed to escape it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incense Dragon, can
you unlock it?” the Fiendqueen asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same tricks as
always. I’ll try to find some of its critical points, then you’ll
use force to power through,” Daolord Incense Dragon said. If one
struck a formation at its critical points, you would be able to
achieve ten times the normal effect, giving you a chance to break
through it with raw power. “This formation is fairly complicated.
It should take me quite some time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Work quickly.” The
Fiendqueen nodded, then waved her hand. Whoosh! Dark mist spread out
to cover the entire forest. That way, any Daolords passing by would
be unable to discover that Solesky and Badlands were hiding here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Daolord Incense Dragon waved his hand, causing a wooden cottage to
descend. He sat down in the lotus position within the wooden cottage,
then stared at the formation in front of him and began to carefully
analyze it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed
onwards. One year, two years, three years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendqueen and the
other two Daolords continued to wait outside. Two other squads of
Daolords passed by during this period of time, but when they saw the
baleful aura of Fiendqueen Dustrain they kept a safe distance away
from her. She had earned her deadly reputation, and very few were
willing to offend her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen, these
are three of the critical points of the formation. You need to strike
all three at the same time.” Daolord Incense Dragon suddenly
emerged from the wooden house and pointed at three of the critical
junctions. As the critical points continued to shift positions, the
Daolord’s markers continuously shifted with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
Fiendqueen’s body blurred as she suddenly manifested six arms. She
struck out with three of them, launching three crystalline
palm-strikes at those three critical points simultaneously with
overwhelming power. With a single massive boom, the runes of the
formation immediately began to crack apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The two
ashen-faced Daolords inside the formation began to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break apart and
disappear.” Fiendqueen Dustrain dismissed her secret art, leaving
just two arms behind. It was now time for her to unleash her most
powerful attacks, and she continuously rained down strikes upon the
remaining formations. The formations trembled and shook, causing the
entire forest to sway, but they continued to endure her strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This grand formation
was formed through seven linked formations. We’ve already defeated
two layers of formations.” Daolord Incense Dragon said hurriedly,
“I think if we can defeat the third one, the remaining four would
be unable to resist your power, Fiendqueen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then hurry up!”
The Fiendqueen was clearly growing rather impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daolord
Incense Dragon entered the wood room once more. Time flowed a hundred
times faster than normal in here, and he continued his research from
within. While he did his research, the other two sat in the lotus
position outside the forest and kept a quiet watch. Suddenly, two
figures appeared off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Fiendqueen
Dustrain and Daolord Feiting both turned to look, only to see a
white-robed youth carrying a golden sword on his back alongside a
grim-faced silver-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth?”
Daolord Feiting’s face turned grim. He sent mentally, “Fiendqueen,
that’s Daolord Darknorth. He also belongs to Vastheaven Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The puny Darknorth
wouldn’t dare to fight with me.” The Fiendqueen didn’t hold
Ning in any regard at all. She stood amongst the most supreme
Daolords of the Endless Territories, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord flew close to them. “Fuck off,” the
Fiendqueen barked. “Otherwise, don’t blame me for taking your
lives!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You and what army?”
A cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste words
with her. Let’s do this!” A longstaff appeared in the Ninedust
Sectlord’s hands, and he charged forwards with a mighty roar.
</P>

Chapter 3 - Frenzied Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendqueen Dustrain was
flabbergasted by this. She never would’ve imagined that the two
Daolords before her would actually dare to assault her. Enraged to
the point of laughter, she said, “Suicidal fools!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A dense black fog
suddenly swept out from her and surged towards Ji Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that all you
have?” Ninedust’s body became protected by rippling curtains of
water that surged forward like waves. They clashed straight against
the surging black mist, with both actually being stalemated for a
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend.” The
white-robed youth with the golden sword on his back, Ji Ning, let out
a low growl. Instantly, the area around him became filled with a
partial illusion of an absolutely enormous world. At the center of
this world was an enormous sword-shaped mountain that came crashing
down with ferocity! The heartworld projection came down. BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! The black mist, already stalemated by the rippling curtains of
water, actually started to be crushed apart by the force of Ning’s
heartworld projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine novessence
arts!” Nine energy dragons flew out of Ning’s body, howling with
rage as they attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ripplewater art,
the nine novessence arts, and the heartworld projection, all at the
same time. The Fiendqueen’s black mist was completely overwhelmed
and destroyed, and both her and her two Daolord allies were
suppressed and weakened by the effects of the three enemy domains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually have
such powerful secret arts?” The Fiendqueen felt her body grow
sluggish, almost as though entire worlds were pressing down against
her. She felt as though she was an ordinary person trapped in
quicksand, with every single movement and motion being incredibly
taxing. She could hardly believe this. “Right now, I’m only able
to use perhaps 60% of my full power at most! How could they have
developed such powerful secret arts?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahh! Fiendqueen!”
Daolord Feiting let out a horrified cry from next to her. He was
suffering the same thing she was, but the repercussions for him were
far greater. “Fiendqueen, I’m able to unleash at most a tenth of
my full strength. What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of crazed rage
appeared in the Fiendqueen’s crimson eyes. The two sides had yet to
actually engage in battle, but these two had already seized the upper
hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Secret arts were
extremely important types of support skills, but in the end they
relied on outside sources of power, making it extremely difficult to
truly upgrade them! Ninedust only reached his current level of power
in his Ripplewater art due to countless years of accumulating
resources, as well as him being lucky enough to acquire the
Dragonfish ki within the core of the planet he had been in. As for
Ning, he had insights into many different Daos and the guidance of
the [Seven Leafpill Chapters], which was why he had been able to
master those nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ripplewater art,
the nine novessence arts, and a heartworld projection! When the three
were applied in succession, their power was comparable to Daolord
Allgod at his peak when he personally used the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had once
been ranked as one of the top three cultivators of the Endless
Territories, and his nine novessence arts were an important part of
the reason for this. He was able to use these arts to suppress the
likes of Emperor Melobo, causing Melobo to be dramatically weakened
in combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Feiting is just
barely on par with ordinary Eternal Emperors in power, but he’s
actually been suppressed to the point where he can barely fight.
However… even though I’m only able to unleash 60% of my power,
that’ll still be more than enough.” The Fiendqueen’s face
became even more savage as she growled, “Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! She shot straight
towards the Ninedust Sectlord, who was also charging straight towards
her. The Fiendqueen growled furiously as she struck out with her
crystalline hands, a layer of black light covering them as she
reached towards the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Ninedust Sectlord struck out with his longstaff, sending it arcing
through the skies in a beautiful line that culminated in a lashing
strike against the Fiendqueen’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both felt absolute
confidence in themselves. Both chose to fight head-on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! An enormous
explosion could be heard. Both the Fiendqueen and the Ninedust
Sectlord were all knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Impossible!”
The Fiendqueen could hardly believe it. At her level of power, she
should’ve been able to trample over second-tier Daolords even with
just 60% of her full strength. How was it that she hadn’t been able
to gain any advantages at all just now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s actually on
par with me, even when two secret arts and a heartworld projection
are suppressing her?” The Ninedust Sectlord was enraged by this.
“Again!” Whoosh! This time, his aura skyrocketed in power as he
raised his longstaff high in the air, then delivered a furious
frontal strike with it. The Fiendqueen’s face tightened, but she
still elected to use her hands to block this blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, the sound of
the collision was a very low and deep one. However, Ning could feel
his own heart tremble from it. The Ninedust Sectlord’s body
trembled as his momentum was halted, while Fiendqueen Dustrain was
knocked flying backwards, a few flecks of blood visible on the corner
of her lips. She said angrily, “I didn’t expect you to actually
be an Ancient cultivator!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Ninedust
Sectlord was quite proud and confident. “You aren’t bad at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you didn’t have
these secret arts and the heartworld projection, do you think you
would be able to kill me?” A cold light flashed through the
Fiendqueen’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What I think is that
you should fuck off. You aren’t able to beat the two of us,”
Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scram,” Ning
agreed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, both of them
realized that Ninedust had only been able to seize a slight advantage
thanks to his usage of that forbidden divine ability. If they really
were to continue this fight, they wouldn’t be able to do anything
to Fiendqueen Dustrain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off? Did you
actually just tell me to fuck off?” The Fiendqueen’s
emerald-colored face was filled with rage. Gritting her teeth, she
produced a strange fiery-red globe in her hands. The globe was
covered with many twisting, protruding lines. She tossed it high in
the air, and the protruding lines on its surface instantly flared
with light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, it was
like a fiery star had appeared in the skies and was emanating streams
of blurry red light. The streams of hazy red light covered the entire
area. When the nine novessence arts and the Ripplewater art touched
the red light, the two instantly could sense their secret arts were
dramatically weakened. Ning could even sense that the influence of
his heartworld projection was being similarly weakened by the
countless streams of red light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What type of
treasure is this?” Ning and Ninedust exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen, I’m
doing much better now. I’m now able to unleash eighty to ninety
percent of my full power.” Daolord Feiting revealed a smile, his
body now protected by that blurry red light. Although the heartworld
projection still continued to have an impact on him, he was clearly
doing much better than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen.”
Daolord Incense Dragon, who had been analyzing the formations from
far, walked out of his wooden house. Earlier, the power of the secret
arts and heartworld projection had been so great that he had no
choice but to remain in hiding. “Let Feiting and I work together to
fight Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. The two of you
should work together to get rid of him as soon as possible. As for
the Ancient cultivator… hmph. He’s going to die as well.” The
Fiendqueen once more charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, let’s have a
fun fight!” The Ninedust Sectlord once more charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched out his
arms, a Northbow sword in each hand as he slowly strolled towards
Daolord Feiting, a smile on his face. “Ninedust, there aren’t as
many people as famous as Fiendqueen Dustrain. If you can beat her,
you’ll definitely become famous.” As he spoke, he suddenly
charged straight towards Daolord Feiting, who was wielding a set of
six azure swords as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The distant
Daolord Incense Dragon waved a finger from afar, causing a thousand
golden globes to shoot towards Ning like a storm of meteors. As they
flew outwards, they actually came together to form a strange
formation-diagram that came crashing towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How laughable.”
Just as Ning began to battle against Daolord Feiting, Ning suddenly
unleashed a heartforce attack. Two surges of heartforce struck out,
smashing against the souls and truesouls of both of them. Both of the
Daolords managed to endure the hit, but next came the even more
bizarre [Dreamstar] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Daolord
Incense Dragon stumbled backwards, the formation-diagram formed by
the thousand golden beads scattering and breaking apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Feiting saw a series of illusions appear in front of him as well, and
he let out a furious growl as he worked to break it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A streak of
sword-light chopped straight across Daolord Feiting’s body.
Although he was protected by a suit of Eternal armor, the terrifying
collisive power within Ning’s strike was still enough to cause him
to spit out a mouthful of blood as he was knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh! While flying
backwards, Daolord Feiting still managed to strike out with his six
azure swords, sending them howling through the air towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning used his two swords to clash twelve times against the enemy’s
swords, then stabbed past them to strike straight at Daolord Feiting
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, his strike
was delivered using the Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop. This was the
most powerful stance Ning could use with his Northbow swords,
especially after they absorbed the golden sand from the shattered
world-core. This strike scraped past the six swords and struck
Daolord Feiting right on his lower jaw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spurt! Blood flew out
of Daolord Feiting’s mouth as he was sent flying backwards. For a
second, he was completely dazed by the force of this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.”
Ning’s other longsword struck out, moving to wrap itself around
Daolord Feiting and bind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run, quick!” A
formation-diagram descended, blocking Ning’s Northbow sword as
Daolord Incense Dragon let out a frantic mental shout from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning’s sword
collided head-on with Daolord Incense Dragon’s formation-diagram.
This bought time for Daolord Feiting to come back to his senses, and
his face was completely ashen. He knew just how close he had come to
dying. He immediately transformed into a gust of wind, moving at
fifty times the speed of light as he fled straight towards Daolord
Incense Dragon’s direction.

fled, his mind was filled with horror and shock. In truth, he was
also quite strong. He was a second-tier Daolord who had reached an
extremely high level in the Dao of Wind, and in battle his movements
were inscrutable and ghostly. His sword was similarly fast and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, just now when
he had battled against Ji Ning, he had found himself at a completely
disadvantage. During their first clash, Ning had used the [Dreamstar]
art against him, not even giving him a chance to use his agility
techniques. Right after that, Ning had hit him with a sword-blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the second
clash, Ning hadn’t used the [Dreamstar] art. They had competed in
close combat alone… and it had only taken Ning two strikes! After
twelve clashes of sword-light, Daolord Feiting had been completely
defeated! It was clear that the disparity in their close combat
skills was simply enormous, and Ning’s sword-stab against his lower
jaw had completely dazed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes. He had been
completely dazed. For a brief instant, he had essentially lost
consciousness. Normally, in a battle between two experts who were on
the same level, one wouldn’t be knocked unconscious by just a few
strikes! “The power of that stab of his was simply incredible.
There should be few to no second-tier Daolords capable of enduring
such a hit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Feiting,
what happened?” Daolord Incense Dragon had been attacking with
magic treasures from afar. He said anxiously, “Why did you run? Our
original plan was for you to fight him in close combat and me to
assault him from afar with my treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw the plan. I’m
no match for him at all. Even when he doesn’t use heartforce, there
are few to no second-tier Daolords who are a match for him.”
Daolord Feiting was both nervous and infuriated by what had happened.
He sent mentally, “I was actually knocked unconscious by him just
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the force of a
blow exceeded one’s ability to endure it, one would be instantly
dazed and rendered unconscious for a brief moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, although
Ning’s sword-arts were quite powerful and his close combat skills
were formidable, he really wasn’t powerful enough to produce this
effect by himself. It was primarily because the Northbow swords were
perfectly suited to the Blood Drop stance that the power of this
particular attack was so great! If Ning had a Universe treasure, he
would instantly become at least ten times more powerful than before!
Ning’s Northbow swords, after having absorbed a veritable sea of
golden sand, had reached an apex in certain areas and had could be
said to have reached the foundational level for a Universe treasure.
As a result, his Blood Drop stance was more than five times more
powerful than it had been in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and run! I
can’t stop him either,” Daolord Incense Dragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning
sped towards them at high speeds, bursting through and scattering the
thousand golden pearls and the formation-diagram they had formed.
Next, Ning charged straight towards Daolord Incense Dragon and
Daolord Feiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen!” Both
of the Daolords began to run while sending mental pleas to Fiendqueen
Dustrain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth is too
powerful. The two of us cannot stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen, we can’t
hold him any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the battle between
Ning and the two Daolords could be described as a lopsided affair,
the battle between the Fiendqueen and the Ninedust Sectlord could
only be described as a fierce one! Although the Fiendqueen was a
woman, her attacks were clearly more overbearing and dominating, with
her close combat skills more perfected. Her hands fluctuated through
many different attacks, including finger-arts, palm-arts, and
fist-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Ninedust
Sectlord, he was also quite fierce and valiant. Whenever he was in a
tight spot, he would immediately use his forbidden divine ability. As
an Ancient cultivator, his divine body was simply far more powerful
than that of any ordinary cultivators. When he also used that special
divine ability? Although a common saying is that the higher a level
you are at, the more important the Dao would be, his raw divine power
was simply too brutal and explosive, generating an enormous amount of
strength for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, this was
the first time for him to fight against an expert on the level of the
Fiendqueen. Thus, he was particularly excited and really went
all-out, learning quite a bit from the fight as it progressed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendqueen,
Darknorth is too powerful. We can’t hold him!” Daolord Incense
Dragon and Daolord Feiting sent mental messages to her as they fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!?” The
Fiendqueen’s face turned pale. Even when the two worked together,
they still weren’t a match for Darknorth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn!” The
Fiendqueen glared at the Ninedust Sectlord. She knew that there was
nothing she could do against this Ancient cultivator. Although she
was one of the truly top-tier Daolords and thus didn’t worry about
most Ancient cultivators, Ninedust wasn’t just an ordinary Ancient
cultivator, he was one whose Dao was incredibly powerful, making him
a tough foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
Fiendqueen turned and charged straight towards Ning’s direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s running?”
The Ninedust Sectlord was startled by this. Unable to make it to Ning
in time, he immediately sent mentally, “Careful, Darknorth!
Fiendqueen Dustrain is headed straight for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
exerted his heartworld projection and thus had a clear picture of the
world around him. He didn’t panic in the slightest as the
Fiendqueen charged towards him; instead, he felt slightly excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning turned
and waited calmly for the Fiendqueen’s arrival, his Northbow swords
at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You overestimate
yourself. Die!” The Fiendqueen chopped out with her two crystalline
palms, which descended towards Ning while blocking out the skies
above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Two
streaks of sword-light, emanating a terrifying sword-intent of
complete annihilation, instantly struck head-on against those two
giant crystalline hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning was sent
flying backwards. When he landed on the ground, he still stumbled
three steps backwards before he stabilized himself. He narrowed his
eyes, his body still shaking from that blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He took it head on?”
The Fiendqueen had sensed a terrifyingly sharp force seek to pierce
through her palms and into her body, but she was able to endure it
with ease. She stared at the distant white-robed youth and his two
golden swords, a look of surprise in her eyes. “I launched those
two palm attacks with nearly full power, but he actually took it
head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t run!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was in hot pursuit from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Fiendqueen let out a cold snort, then quickly fled off into the
distance as the fiery red globe in the skies flew towards her as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them didn’t
elect to pursue her. After the Fiendqueen, Daolord Incense Dragon,
and Daolord Feiting fled a suitably far distance, they began to slow
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendqueen glanced
at the red globe in her hands, then said in a cold voice, “Most of
its power has been used up. Roughly thirty million cubes of chaos
jewels was used up.” This precious fiery globe was something which
she had traded away an incredibly valuable bottle of spirit-pills
for, all for the sake of acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals! That bottle
had only held a total of three pills within it, and she had acquired
it thanks to a stroke of good fortune when roving the Terror Starsea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery globe could
only be activated directly by Hegemon-level Immortal energy. The only
other option was to slowly charge it using chaos jewels, and it took
a total of fifty million cubes to charge it up. However, it truly was
tremendously powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you were
working together. How did you end up being defeated that quickly?”
The Fiendqueen glanced at the two Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth was simply
too powerful. The two of us combined were still no match for him at
all.” Daolord Feiting shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if five
Daolords on our level joined together, we still wouldn’t
necessarily be able to capture him. Just two of us? Forget it.”
Daolord Incense Dragon shook his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth was powerful
in close combat and also a Heartforce Cultivator! He really was a
tough foe to face and would be virtually invincible amongst his
peers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With those two
around, it’ll be virtually impossible for us to capture Solesky.”
The Fiendqueen let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
simply stood there, staring at the three distant Daolords as they
gradually disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a delightful
battle.” The Ninedust Sectlord was very excited. “I’ve never
fought against someone on that level before. Delightful, simply
delightful! But my staff-arts still need more work. If I can perfect
them a bit further, I should be able to crush that Fiendqueen
Dustrain. Haha, I’m already able to fight her to a standstill as
is! I guess that means I should be ranked within the top seven in the
Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… where did she
find that fiery globe?” Ninedust was puzzled. “Our intelligence
reports didn’t indicate that she was in possession of such a
powerful treasure. It was so mighty, it was able to resist both of
our secret arts and your heartworld projection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “It’s probably something she prepared specifically for
this mission to acquire the Voidsea Jadeseals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they spoke, they
turned to move towards the distant forest. With the black mist gone,
they were able to clearly see Daolord Solesky and Daolord Badlands
within the forest grove. Daolord Solesky’s face was still deathly
pale, and his aura was much weaker than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother!” Ning
called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Daolord
Solesky looked exhausted, he was still in a wonderful mood. He
laughed, “I saw everything! Badlands and I saw everything.
Darknorth, Ninedust, the two of you truly are powerful. Fiendqueen
Dustrain is famous throughout the Endless Territories, and she even
had Incense Dragon and Feiting with her… and yet, in the end they
were defeated by the two of you. When word of this spreads, quite a
few people will be scared silly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive.”
Daolord Badlands looked at Ninedust. “Fellow Daoist Ninedust is an
Ancient cultivator, correct? He was actually able to fight the
Fiendqueen to a standstill. Incredible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust nodded calmly.
He was courteous to Ning, partially because he acknowledged Ning’s
strength and partially because they had undergone many life-and-death
experiences together. Ninedust was by nature an arrogant man; if you
weren’t his friend, he wouldn’t pay any attention to you no
matter how strong you were. Daolord Badlands was quite famous as
well, but Ninedust really didn’t care that much about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Daolord Badlands turned his gaze towards Ning, then sighed. “When
we first met, you were an Elder God, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
Indeed, back then he had just left the Three Realms and had visited
the Badlands Court alongside his big brother Solesky. He really was
just an Elder God at that time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder I found it
so difficult to use Numerancy to divine your destiny.” Daolord
Badlands shook his head and smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands, big
brother Solesky… how long will it take for you two to leave this
formation?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the forest
grove, Solesky and Badlands exchanged a glance. Good question. How
were they supposed to leave? Entering the formation was fairly easy,
but breaking it apart was much more difficult. They had chosen to
hide themselves within this hard-to-break formation to avoid
Fiendqueen Dustrain, and it had taken her many years with the aid of
Daolord Incense Dragon, a formation master, in order to destroy the
two outer layers. In the art of formations, Badlands and Solesky were
inferior to Daolord Incense Dragon.

Chapter 5 - The Palace of Immortals, Rankings Redone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky and Badlands
began to work on unlocking this formation while using a temporal
acceleration treasure. To enter the formation, they simply needed to
find a small opening for them to bore in through! Actually defeating
the entire formation was thousands of times more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than 120 years went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible?” Daolord Badlands suddenly let out a startled cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
nearby Solesky turned to look at him in confusion, as did Ji Ning and
Ninedust from outside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just received word
that a short while ago, the Radiant King got into a huge fight with
an ordinary and little-known Daolord named Daolord Dreamlore.” A
look of disbelief was on Daolord Badlands’ face. “The Radiant
King… lost!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Radiant King
lost?” Ning, Ninedust, and Solesky were all stunned by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
figures in the Endless Territories who were acknowledged by all as
being absolutely terrifying to face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top-ranked figure,
Winesage, was a Heartforce Cultivator. He went without saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second-ranked
figure, Palace Lord Dawnstar, had reached incredible heights in the
Dao of the Saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third-ranked
figure, the Radiant King, was the fastest Daolord alive! In addition,
everyone knew how deadly his three killer attacks were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew long ago that
there had to be many low-key Daolords of incredible power who
hastened here to the Waveshift Realm.” The Ninedust Sectlord said
in a disbelieving manner, “But for this ‘Daolord Dreamlore’ to
actually be able to defeat the Radiant King is simply inconceivable.
The Radiant King is definitely one of the most terrifying Daolords in
all of existence, and he moves so fast as to render the vast majority
of Daolords helpless before him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What does Daolord
Dreamlore’s area of expertise lie in? How was he able to defeat the
Radiant King?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used a
bloodblade,” Daolord Badlands said quickly. “When his bloodblade
left his sheath, it was so incredibly fast that not even the Radiant
King could handle it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the Radiant King
is the fastest of all Daolords!” The Ninedust Sectlord truly
couldn’t believe this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s the fastest
of all Daolords in terms of movement speed, but that doesn’t
necessarily mean that his attack speed is also the fastest,” Ning
said. Weapon speed and movement speed… these were two different
concepts. Ning sighed in amazement, “I really can’t imagine how
the Radiant King, the fastest of all Daolords, was actually defeated
by this ‘Daolord Dreamlore’ and his even-faster weapon. How fast
was Daolord Dreamlore’s bloodblade?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the Palace
of Immortals needs to release a new ranking soon.” Solesky let out
a sigh. “It has been a long, long time since the top three Daolord
rankings have changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It really is
time for a new list.” Badlands was quite eager to see the new list
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Countless
Verge-level Daolords have made their way to the Waveshift Realm. The
Voidsea Jadeseals haven’t made their appearances yet, but an
earth-shaking battle has already occurred.” Ning shook his head.
“Once the jade seals do appear, countless Daolords will fight over
them and the entire rankings list will be changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There will probably
be more changes in the lower rankings than in the higher rankings.
The top three probably won’t change that much.” Badlands
chuckled. “In the past, we always viewed Winesage, Dawnstar, and
the Radiant King as being unshakable figures. The Radiant King was
defeated, but my feeling is that it is very unlikely that Winesage or
Dawnstar will lose their positions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage goes
without saying. Not only is he also a Heartforce Cultivator, he even
has a Universe treasure. He’s vastly outstripped all other Daolords
in power. As for Palace Lord Dawnstar, he’s terrifying in close
combat. He’s not all that fast, but his saber… his saber is an
absolute nightmare to face! Even Winesage had been forced to rely on
his heartforce abilities to just barely eke out a win over Palace
Lord Dawnstar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Solesky, and
Ninedust all agreed with this assessment. The top three had all
reached the apex in certain areas. The Radiant King had reached the
apex of speed… but alas, he had been defeated. Palace Lord Dawnstar
had reached the apex of close combat, and was thus even more powerful
than the Radiant King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most mysterious
place in all the Endless Territories… the Palace of Immortals of
the Dao Alliance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance
operated on the principle of governance through inaction. Although
many battles took place within its territories, it remained the
undisputed number one organization of the Endless Territories! Its
roots and its foundation were unfathomably deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom, the Aberrants, the Ancient cultivators… these three
organizations all had Hegemons! But even the three Hegemons weren’t
confident in their chances if they were to face off against the Dao
Alliance. In truth, they were quite envious of the Dao Alliance. No
one dared to challenge the Dao Alliance’s position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Dawn War,
the Dao Alliance had risen to sudden prominence with incredible
speed, catching up to the Ancient cultivators in power. After the
Dawn War ended, the Dao Alliance quickly outstripped the entire race
of Ancients. By now, its power was simply unfathomable. It had many
generations of powerful Eternal Emperors, such as Emperor Heartsword
and Emperor Mirrorsnow, who the Dao Alliance to go out wandering
about freely. The Dao Alliance didn’t try to control them at all,
continuing to operate on a laissez-faire basis. In truth, this was
also a sign of its supreme confidence. One could only imagine how
terrifyingly deep its foundations were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” Loud
laughter rang out from a bridge located deep within the Palace of
Immortals of the Dao Alliance. The laughter came from two people; a
bald alien covered in golden fur, and a black-haired, black-robed
elder. Both of them radiated auras of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old brother
Blackcloud, your disciple truly is quite astonishing!” The
gold-furred alien roared with laughter. “He just amazed everyone
and beat the Radiant King!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This disciple of
mine is an absolute fanatic.” The black-haired, black-robed elder
was all smiles as he said, “When he became a Daolord, I allowed him
to choose a single treasure from my treasury… and he chose an
incredibly evil bloodblade which had been left behind in the Terror
Starsea. From that day forth, he became completely infatuated with
that bloodblade. In his heart, that bloodblade is probably even more
important to him than I am, even though I am his master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only when one is
completely devoted to one’s weapons can one unleash their maximum
power,” the gold-furred alien said with praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. At his current
level of power, he is capable of threatening quite a few Eternal
Emperors.” The black-robed elder nodded and praised, “The
appearance of the Voidsea Jadeseals truly is a priceless opportunity
for him. If he can acquire one of them, his chances of succeeding in
the Daomerge in the future shall become much greater than before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift, that
bastard! He was far too stingy. We watched him rise to power and
provided him quite a bit of help, but in the end? He only gave us a
single Voidsea Jadeseal. He hid the other five in his own Waveshift
Realm! I really don’t know what he was thinking.” The gold-furred
alien shook his head. “Thirty thousand chaos cycles ago, my
Primaltwin ran into him on accident. He just winked at me before
running off. Disloyal brat. I should be considered one of his
elders!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift is now far
more powerful than the two of us.” The black-robed elder let out a
sigh. “His skills in the Dao of Numerancy have reached unfathomable
and unreachable heights. Many great powers often beg him for
assistance, including those lords of alternate universe and those
other ancient powers. For us, travelling through the Great Dark to
visit other places is an incredibly taxing journey, but for that
brat? He goes wherever he wants to go. We simply cannot compare to
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we really
cannot. Not even the three Hegemons in our Endless Territories have
as easy a life as he does.” The gold-furred alien sighed as well.
“Those of us in the Endless Territories who want to go out on a
trip have to wait a long, long time, but that brat? Ah, forget it.
The more I talk about him, the more jealous I feel. I’m starting to
wish I would’ve made my Dao the Dao of Numerancy as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Numerancy? You?
Don’t make me laugh my socks off. Hurry up and go work on updating
the rankings. Since my disciple was involved, it wouldn’t be
appropriate for me to take part in updating the list. I’ll have to
trouble you to do it,” the black-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are using this
as an excuse to be lazy!” The gold-furred alien glared at the old
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, hurry! Stop
dawdling!” the black-robed elder urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-furred alien
waved his hand, producing a golden book and then opening it. The book
was filled with a list of names. The gold-furred alien poured his
Immortal energy into the book, causing the rankings to instantly
change. When this happened, the subordinates of the Palace of
Immortals instantly received notifications, and they quickly began to
spread word of this affair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The new rankings of the
Endless Territories was as follows:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top Daolord:
Winesage. <BR> The second Daolord: Palace Lord Dawnstar. <BR> The
third Daolord: Daolord Dreamlore. <BR> The fourth Daolord: the
Radiant King. <BR> The fifth Daolord: Sectlord Timedream. <BR> The
sixth Daolord: Daolord Skyaxe. <BR> The seventh Daolord: King Gorsch.
<BR> The eighth Daolord: Fiendqueen Dustrain. <BR> The ninth Daolord:
Starking. <BR> The tenth Daolord: Palace Lord Cloudwalker <BR> The
eleventh Daolord: King Cliffbank <BR> The twelfth Daolord: King Wu <BR>
The thirteenth Daolord: Daolord Shaka
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of Immortals
was incredibly powerful. Within the span of a day, this information
was spread throughout the entire Endless Territories. As for the many
Verge-level Daolords within the Waveshift Realm, they received word
as well. All of them sighed in amazement. The top three rankings
hadn’t changed in over a thousand chaos cycles… and now, one of
the positions had suddenly been seized! This truly was unexpected. It
must be remembered that the fight over the Voidsea Jadeseals had yet
to even begin. In fact, no one knew a single thing about them thus
far!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the likes of
Ning and Ninedust, the only ones they clashed against were Fiendqueen
Dustrain and her two allies. The other Daolords they had run into
maintained their vigilance but didn’t choose to start any battles.
Clearly, everyone was being fairly conservative in the early stages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Voidsea
Jadeseals actually appear and the fights over them begin… I wonder
what new updates to the list the Palace of Immortals shall make?”
Countless Daolords were eagerly waiting to see what would happen.
Very few of them would succeed in the Daomerge and gain eternity,
which made them care even more about this ranking. To the vast
majority of Daolords, getting a high ranking on the list would be
their crowning moment of glory.

Chapter 6 - Polo The Realmsoul
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After more than 180
years of hard work, Solesky and Badlands finally managed to break
through the formation and emerge from that seemingly-ordinary forest
grove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. A cold wind
was howling, with petals of snow drifting about. The forest had
already been covered with a thick layer of snow. The Waveshift Realm
had various different seasons and different types of weather, such as
rain and snow. Ji Ning and the others didn’t dare to interfere with
the weather-generating formations, especially since the rain and the
snow did very little to them. They simply sighed at how amazing
Emperor Waveshift had been in the art of formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, those who
were skilled in Numerancy were generally also quite skilled in the
art of formations. Badlands himself was quite talented in this area
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Badlands and Solesky
emerged from the snow-shrouded forest, smiles on their faces. They
were in excellent moods. “We’re finally out! We were shut up in
there for far too long. Now that Darknorth and brother Ninedust are
alongside us, life shall be much easier,” Badlands said with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, the two
of us were repeatedly hunted down and attacked by others. Every time
we encountered a squad of Daolords, we’d end up being drawn into an
ugly fight. That was absolutely horrid.” Daolord Solesky shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
had an icy frown on his face. “If the two of you follow us…
whenever any other Daolord squads find you, a major battle will
probably break out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t need to
worry about that,” Daolord Badlands said. “Based on what I was
able to see with regards to the Waveshift Realm and based on what
I’ve learned regarding the Voidsea Jadeseals… I feel certain that
Emperor Waveshift has already planned things out perfectly. Despite
my Numerancy prowess, I’m completely unable to cause any
disturbances to Emperor Waveshift’s plans. There’s no way for me
to actually find these seals, and so the two of us shall temporarily
hide within Darknorth’s estate-world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide in my
estate-world?” Ning nodded. Once they were hidden away, the other
Daolords they ran into wouldn’t go so far as to cause trouble for
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands.” The
Ninedust Sectlord frowned. “Are you saying that you aren’t going
to be of any use to us at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I might be of use at
certain critical moments. As for right now? I admit that I really am
of no use.” Badlands nodded and admitted it. “Emperor Waveshift’s
abilities far surpassed my own. Even when I become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, I’ll still be far from being a match for him. So long
as the Voidsea Jadeseals remain hidden, there’s no way I’ll be
able to locate them at all! If I try to engage in any divinations, I
might end up falling for some of Emperor Waveshift’s schemes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
agreement. It made sense! Juniors like them had no chance of using
Numerancy to disrupt Emperor Waveshift’s intricate preparations. It
was best for them to just try their luck alongside the other
Daolords. That would actually be safer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took Solesky and
Badlands into his estate-world, then continued to journey through the
Waveshift Realm alongside Ninedust. Although they did occasionally
encounter a few other Daolord squads, with Solesky and Badlands
hidden away the other Daolords did not move to attack them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than a thousand years had gone past since the Voidsea Jadeseals
had made their presences known.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this millennium,
virtually all of the Verge-level Daolords of the Endless Territories
had hurriedly made their way to this realm! Some simply weren’t
able to come here because they were too far away, but the truly
powerful Daolords were generally able to make it to the Waveshift
Realm over the course of a thousand years, no matter where they were
originally located within the Endless Territories. As for those
ranked in the top ten, all of them arrived during the first century
or two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast Waveshift
Realm suddenly began to tremble as an aura of incredible power began
to spread out and cover it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A squad of Daolords who
were walking through a mountain range raised their heads, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-haired man
dressed in an astral robe who was walking through the wilds raised
his head to stare towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A skinny old man who
was seated on the lotus position atop a beautiful boat that was
drifting through the oceans suddenly narrowed his eyes and raised his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A squad of Daolords who
were carefully advancing through a deep gorge all raised their heads
to stare at the skies outside the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords throughout the
entirety of the Waveshift Realm all raised their heads to stare
towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
seated atop a boat that was 2400 meters wide that was drifting
through a lake. They raised their heads to stare towards the skies as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ninedust was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s
happening. Big brother, Daolord Badlands! Something big is
happening!” Ning waved his hand, causing Badlands and Solesky to
appear next to them. As soon as they appeared, they immediately
raised their heads as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blurry streams of
rainbow light could be seen in the skies. The rainbow light gathered
together in the air, slowly coming together into a humanoid shape.
This was a towering male figure dressed in white robes, and he stared
downwards towards Ning’s squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolords!” His
voice rang out, echoing throughout every inch of the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant, tens
of thousands of white-robed figures appeared throughout the ten
layers of the Waveshift Realm. They filled the skies above the
various squads of Daolords, with one figure staring at each squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I… am the spirit
of the Grand Waveshift Formation which is comprised of all of the
formations and barriers within the Waveshift Realm. You could also
consider me to be the realmsoul of the entire Waveshift Realm!” The
white-robed man continued to speak from his position in the skies.
“You can also refer to me as Polo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul?” The
tens of thousands of Daolords within the Waveshift Realm all
immediately paid close attention. If a formation reached incredible
heights in profundity, it was possible for a formation-spirit to be
born from it. For example, the Allgod Estate of Daolord Allgod had
given birth to a formation-spirit as well! As for the Grand Waveshift
Formation which Emperor Waveshift had set up, it was clearly far more
complicated. It only made sense that it was able to form a realmsoul
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On my master’s
orders, I have been waiting here for countless years.” The tens of
thousands of white-robed figures all spoke at the same instant, their
voices echoing continuously throughout the realm. “Finally, after
countless years, Daolord Badlands has activated certain triggers
which my master left behind, causing the five Voidsea Jadeseals to
emerge into this realm! Now that a thousand years have gone by, all
of the truly powerful Daolords should have already reached the
Waveshift Realm. Thus, I can now publicize the location of the
Voidsea Jadeseals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A thousand years
have gone by?” Instantly, the Radiant King, King Gorsch, Winesage,
and the many other Daolords began to silently curse. No wonder they
hadn’t been able to find any of the Voidsea Jadeseals. So Emperor
Waveshift’s original intention had always been to make them wait a
thousand years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth, all five
of the Voidsea Jadeseals are located right here in the Waveshift
Realm! Two are within the ninth layer and three are within the tenth
layer. For none of you to have found it is simply a sign that your
luck just wasn’t good enough,” the realmsoul continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth layer and
the tenth layer? B-but…” Ning and Ninedust were instantly
rendered speechless. All of the Daolords who had come from the
Endless Territories were doing the same thing right now: they were
secretly cursing Emperor Waveshift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When everyone first
arrived, they would arrive within the first layer. They’d have to
slowly forge their way deeper inside, and even the fastest had only
reached the ninth layer by now, because the deeper one went the
harder it was to delve any further. The vast majority of powerful
Daolords were in either the eighth or the ninth layer. The eighth
layer alone held more danger than the first seven layers combined!
Thanks to the map Solesky had given them, Ning’s group had been
able to quickly reach the eighth layer shortly after they had arrived
within the Waveshift Realm. However, despite the passage of a
thousand years they were still within the ninth layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that a thousand
years have gone past with none of you discovering any of the Voidsea
Jadeseals… I have no choice but to get involved.” Realmsoul Polo
pointed off into the distance. “The first Voidsea Jadeseal is
located right there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A pillar of light
suddenly shot into the skies off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right over there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Daolords who
had been cursing just moments ago all turned red-eyed with desire.
Realmsoul Polo had just clearly marked out the location of the very
first Voidsea Jadeseal to them! If they were just one second too
slow, some other Daolord would end up running away with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Voidsea Jadeseal!”
A man dressed in ancient black robes which were covered in
complicated runes was relaxing here. His eyes looked dazed, almost
drunk, but when he saw that pillar of white light erupt nearby him
his gaze instantly sharpened. He almost instantly vanished while at
the same time an awe-inspiring heartworld projection descended upon
the area. This was a heartworld projection filled with darkness,
murder, and death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right there!” Ning
and the others felt their blood boiling eagerly as well as they
turned red-eyed with desire. If they could acquire that Voidsea
Jadeseal, their chances at passing the Daomerge would increase more
than tenfold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend!” With but
a thought, Ning instantly sent his incredibly vast heartworld
projection out to descend upon him. His heartworld projection was
filled with mountains, rivers, wastelands, and deserts. At its very
center it had an extremely prominent sword-shaped mountain that was
absolutely enormous. This heartworld projection was large enough that
it covered the entire Waveshift Realm!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than a
hundred thousand Daolords clustered outside the Waveshift Realm. None
of them dared to actually venture inside, and so they waited outside
in the hopes of a miracle occurring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
The countless Daolords all stared in shock towards the Waveshift
Realm as an absolutely enormous heartworld projection appeared in the
skies above it! This illusory world was so vast that it was actually
greater than the entire Waveshift Realm in size, and it was filled
with an aura of murder and darkness! But moments later a second,
third, fourth, and more heartworld projections all appeared in the
skies above the Waveshift Realm, each of them vaster than the entire
realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there this
many heartworld projections?!” The Daolords were all stunned. Every
single heartworld projection represented a Verge-level Heartforce
Cultivator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone wanted to
determine the exact location of the first Voidsea Jadeseal as quickly
as possible, and there was nothing faster than using a heartworld
projection to do just that! Heartforce, godsense, secret arts… all
of those things would take time as they had to slowly fly out in a
straight line! The heartworld projection, however, was the projection
of a cultivator’s heartforce. It could instantly cover an area that
was as vast as the heartworld itself was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words… if
Ning was willing to pay the necessary cost, he could stretch his
heartworld projection to cover an entire territory!

Chapter 7 - The First Voidsea Jadeseal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To use a heartworld
projection to cover the Waveshift Realm was very easy. At present,
there were a total of over twenty Heartforce Cultivators located
within the Waveshift Realm! All of them sent out their heartworld
projections to scan the Waveshift Realm and to clearly scan the
region where the first Voidsea Jadeseal was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
heartworld projections covering this realm, Ning’s included, but
none of the heartworld projections contained any offensive elements
to them. Thus, none of the heartworld projections interfered with the
others! If there was a decision to actually fight with them, the
power of the various heartworld projections would clash against each
other, and the projections of second-tier Heartforce Cultivators like
Ji Ning and Daolord Soleman would’ve been instantly crushed flat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Winesage,
Sectlord Timedream, and Palace Lord Cloudwalker, all three of them
were supreme Heartforce Cultivators. If they sent their heartworld
projections against each other, the end result would simply be that
none of them would be able to scan the area at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ‘fight’ with
heartworld projections would result in it being impossible for anyone
to scan the area. Thus, everyone behaved in a ‘peaceful’ manner
and quietly scanned the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ji Ning was
able to ‘see’ it now. He saw a tall mountain range which held a
dazzling pillar of white light within it. “The Voidsea Jadeseal is
located right inside that mountain.” Ning turned to look at
Ninedust, Solesky, and Badlands. “The mountain is protected by
various protective barriers and seals. There is no way for our
heartworld projections to go past those barriers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartworld projections
covered vast swathes of land, but there were certain types of
formations and barriers that could disrupt them. In fact, there were
some formations that were so strong and so secretive that heartworld
projections couldn’t even detect their presence. Other formations,
however, were ‘publicly visible’. As for the ones covering this
mountain range, it completely blocked out all forms of scrying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move there
as soon as possible. If we’re too slow, someone else will probably
end up seizing it,” Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move right
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
immediately began to fly as quickly as possible, with Badlands
assisting them in using Numerancy to divine the best route to their
destination. There were some extremely well-hidden formations here,
after all; if they weren’t careful, they might end up trapped
within one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea Jadeseal
is right there! It’s quite close to us.” A seven-man Daolord
squad was filled with excitement. The seal really was quite close to
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
All of them transformed into streaks of light as they flew towards
that direction at maximum speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Winesage,
brother Timedream, we can’t let the Voidsea Jadeseals fall into
their hands. Brother Timedream, your heartworld projection is the
strongest. Use it to suppress them or perhaps even kill them if
possible,” a mental voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Timedream,
you do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Sorry for
this, my Heartforce Cultivator friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream was
ranked fifth amongst the Daolords, second only to the Radiant King!
But he was different from Winesage. Winesage trained concurrently in
heartforce, whereas Sectlord Timedream focused all of his efforts in
heartforce! His heartworld projection was much larger than even those
of Winesage and Palace Lord Cloudwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SUPPRESS!” BOOM! A
heartworld projection above the seven Daolords suddenly exploded with
power. All other heartworld projections, including those of Winesage
and Ji Ning, were all instantly crushed apart. Of course, this was
only achieved with such ease because everyone had their heartworld
projections in scanning mode with no offensive elements to them,
making them easy to destroy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a blurry,
illusory world which held a single supreme god who was seated up
high, with countless living beings prostrating before him in
submission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Submit. Submit.
Submit.” Countless voices rang out in the minds of the seven
Daolords as the terrifying heartworld projection pressed down upon
them like an infinitely vast mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!” A
gray-robed old lady let out a miserable scream as she was
extinguished by the projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be this
strong?!” Another Daolord let out a miserable scream as his body
disintegrated under the crushing power of the projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five
Daolords, however, managed to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a small number of
second-tier Daolords had techniques similar to an ‘invulnerable
form’; Ning, for example, had no such technique. Not even the
Ninedust Sectlord had access to such an ability before he broke
through to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step. These five had no
choice but to endure the heartworld projection head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
heartworld projection.” The five Daolords exchanged a glance, their
faces pale. They felt as though they were trapped in quicksand. They
were now moving at a ridiculously slow pace, and they were perhaps
able to at best fly at 1% of their normal speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be Sectlord
Timedream who has made his move.” The five of them were utterly
amazed. They were second-tier Daolords, and thus they didn’t really
understand how vast the gap was between them and the most supreme
Daolords of the Endless Territories. All they knew was that
challenging those Daolords was suicide. It must be remembered that
even supreme Daolords different in power. Daolord Shaka, for example,
was currently ranked as number thirteen. If some of the more low-key
Daolords were included in the ranking, he’d probably be pushed even
further back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream,
however, was different. He was the most powerful ‘pure’
Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” One of the
five, a short and chubby alien, suddenly produced a black metal
medallion in his hands. A fierce light flashed through his eyes as he
suddenly crushed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A halo of black
light appeared around his short and pudgy form, completely protecting
him and ensuring that he wasn’t disturbed by the heartworld
projection in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” The
short alien dramatically sped up as he endured the pressure of the
heartworld projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Redgem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redgem, you
bastard!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four Daolords
turned pale. Although they had certain treasures as well, they were
useless against the weight and pressure of a heartworld projection.
Some were meant to flee through transcending spacetime, some were
offensive in nature… none of them were useful right now. What would
they do with an offensive treasure? Attack the empty space?
Heartworld projections were illusory projections of power; only
treasures like the one Daolord Redgem had used, a treasure that could
completely protect the entire body and prevent anything from
affecting it, would be of use. Those treasures, however, were
incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Just three
seconds later, Daolord Redgem reached that mountain range and charged
straight inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this
happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Voidsea
Jadeseal!” The other four Daolords were incredibly anxious.
Although they all belonged to the same squad and had long ago sworn
lifeblood oaths not to harm each other, none of them were obligated
to give up this opportunity to any of the others. All of them
desperately wanted to acquire a Voidsea Jadeseal and they would use
whatever abilities they had. Whoever was the first to acquire a seal
would be the one it would belong to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Winesage,
brother Cloudwalker, I’ve crushed two of the seven Daolords to
death. Of the remaining five, Daolord Redgem has used some sort of
strange treasure to resist my heartworld projection and has already
charged into the mountain range,” Sectlord Timedream sent to the
other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those five don’t
matter! We have one major problem right now,” Winesage sent back,
“King Gorsch is very close to that mountain. He should make it
inside within a hundred seconds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch?”
Sectlord Timedream instantly spread out his heartworld projection a
bit further. Previously, he had kept it tightly focused and
concentrated on the seven closest Daolords. As soon as he spread it
out, he instantly discovered a silver-robed figure whose entire body
was bathed in blazing red flames. King Gorsch had an icy look on his
face and a berserk look in his eyes as he charged towards the pillar
of light at maximum speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch? What
should we do? There’s no way we can stop him. Given how strong he
is, once he gets there he’ll probably end up grabbing the Voidsea
Jadeseal. Once he takes possession over it, it’ll be very hard for
us to take it back,” Sectlord Timedream sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him and slow
him down as much as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Even if he
does get it, he can forget about escaping with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage, Timedream,
and Cloudwalker were all thinking the same thing. It was very
difficult for supreme Daolords to be killed, by all the other supreme
Daolords would go all-out in their attempts to acquire the Voidsea
Jadeseals. They would all take out their most important
life-preserving treasures! Face with such maddened attacks, even
experts like King Gorsch could well perish. By comparison, however,
King Gorsch would still be a far tougher foe to deal with than the
likes of Daolord Redgem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! In the end, it
was Sectlord Timedream once more who reached out to suppress King
Gorsch with his heartworld projection. The midair King Gorsch
instantly sensed a terrifying power press down upon him, causing his
speed to drop dramatically. A savage look appeared on his face as he
howled angrily, “Timedream, you dare bar my path?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You guessed it.”
Sectlord Timedream’s voice rang out by King Gorsch’s ears.
“Gorsch, forget about acquiring this Voidsea Jadeseal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can stop me!
Anyone who tries will die!” King Gorsch endured the pressure of the
heartworld projection as he continued his charge, flames continuing
to roll off of his body and clash against the heartworld projection.
He was still able to move at 70% of his maximum speed, and he
continued his headlong charge towards the mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As this was happening,
the other Daolords in the ninth layer were also making haste towards
the mountain. Some were far, some were close, but the only Daolord
who the likes of Winesage and Sectlord Timedream really cared about
was King Gorsch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea Jadeseal
isn’t too far away from me. I have a shot.” A man dressed in
thick gray armor was flying forwards at high speed, his eyes glowing
with green light. He was an Aberrant special lifeform whose true form
was that of a strange boulder. By nature, he liked to live a peaceful
and quiet life, which was why he wasn’t very well-known in the
Endless Territories. What no one realized was that he was actually
the most powerful Daolord amongst all the Aberrants. Only something
like the Voidsea Jadeseal was enough to cause a private, peace-loving
figure like him to choose to leave his home and come here to the
Waveshift Realm.

Chapter 8 - King Gorsch
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A black vessel
was flying at through the skies at high speed, with Ji Ning and the
others atop the flying vessel. The vessel sometimes slowed down but
sometimes sped up. Every so often, it would twist and turn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re too far
away, and the ninth layer is filled with far too many dangers. It’ll
probably take us seven or eight months before we reach that mountain.
By then, the Voidsea Jadeseal would’ve been taken long ago.” The
Ninedust Sectlord was rather anxious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have a
shot,” Ning disagreed. “My heartworld projection has been keeping
watch on the world. Winesage, Sectlord Timedream, Fiendqueen
Dustrain, and the others are much farther away than we are. They’re
furiously trying to get there as soon as they can as well. All of the
Daolords close to the mountain are frantically trying to get inside
the mountain. No matter who ends up with the Voidsea Jadeseal, it
won’t be easy for them to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
nearby Daolord Badlands had been seated with his eyes closed as he
engaged in some Numerancy. He suddenly opened his eyes and nodded
slowly. “I’ve finally finished my divinations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve finished
your divinations?” Ning, Ninedust, and Solesky turned to look at
him, their eyes lighting up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can vaguely ‘see’
the insane battle which is about to erupt. One Daolord after another
will perish,” Daolord Badlands said. “The struggles over this
Voidsea Jadeseal will be incredibly intense and lethal! No one will
be able to leave with it with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning and
the others were actually delighted by this. Many Daolords would die?
Who cared! All of them wanted to acquire one of the jade seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, we might
actually be able make it in time after all.” Solesky was excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Considering the size
of the ninth layer, our group is actually fairly close to that
mountain. Daolord Skyaxe and big brother Soleman are more than ten
times as far away as we are,” Ning said. “And we’re much closer
than Winesage as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer you were,
the better your chances would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
Daolord Redgem had been the first to charge in. He swept the area
with his gaze, only to see nothing in the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the Voidsea
Jadeseal? Where?!” Daolord Redgem was frantic. He knew that every
single second he wasted might result in his death. “Come out!” He
swept out his godsense, but the barriers within the mountain range
made it so that he was unable to find it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break!
Break!” The anxious Daolord Redgem manifested a total of eighteen
arms, sending all of them to strike out at the nearby mountains in a
wanton fashion. Boom! Boom! Boom! Stones split apart and shattered.
In virtually just the blink of an eye, every part of the entire
mountain range had been blasted and struck. Deep within the mountain,
a stone pillar suddenly revealed itself as the surrounding stones
were blasted apart. The stone pillar held atop of it a milky-white
jade seal that was round and glowed with light. The jade seal was
absolutely beautiful and intoxicating to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Voidsea
Jadeseal!” Daolord Redgem was incredibly excited. He instantly
charged forwards as he sent all eighteen of his arms to smash against
the stone pillar. BOOM! An enormous sound could be heard as the
formations protecting the pillar were destroyed. In truth, the
formations on the stone pillar were meant to hide it, and they
themselves weren’t all that powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah! The Voidsea
Jadeseal is mine!” Daolord Redgem grabbed the round seal. It looked
like nothing more than an unusual piece of jade. Its surface glowed
with incredibly pure light and no runes or patterns could be seen
atop it. When Daolord Redgem grabbed it, he sent just a tendril of
his Immortal energy into it and instantly could sense that was
beginning to form an ‘illusory body’ within the jade seal that
was absolutely identical to his true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Redgem
immediately put the seal away. He suppressed his joy, his gaze
turning cold and baleful. “Now, I need to come up with a way to
immediately escape the Waveshift Realm! The realm is protected by the
Grand Waveshift Formation, making it impossible for me to use any
sort of temporal or dimensional escaping method. If I want to escape
this place, my only choice is to physically fly out of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go back the
same way I came in. I remember the exact path I took, so I won’t
run into any dangerous regions. Time to go all out!” Daolord Redgem
gritted his teeth, then took out an escape-type Dao-seal and
shattered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was an unremarkable
figure within the Waveshift Realm, but he was still a second-tier
Daolord who was on the same general level as Kongsan or Ji Ning. He
had more than ten protective treasures on him, and escape-type
treasures were naturally included.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! He instantly
transformed into a streak of light and began to charge outwards. When
he escaped the mountain, he instantly saw his four Daolord companions
off in the distance. They were still being suppressed by Sectlord
Timedream’s heartworld projection and thus were unable to fly at as
much as 1% of their normal speed. They still had yet to even reach
the mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redgem!” Their
eyes turned red as they glared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Gentlemen, I
found the Voidsea Jadeseal so it naturally belongs to me.” Daolord
Redgem’s body was still protected by that barrier of black light.
Now that he had also used an evasion-type Dao-seal, he was moving
more than a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Daolord Redgem
completely ignored his compatriots as he hurriedly moved to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to run?”
An enraged roar rang out from off in the distance as a figure
completely bathed in crimson flames charged towards him, radiating an
aura of overwhelming power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the crimson
flames suddenly spread out, giving Daolord Redgem no chance to dodge
as they instantly surrounded him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch?”
Daolord Redgem’s face tightened slightly, but his eyes were filled
with madness. “No one can stop me!” The Dao-seal he had used to
resist the heartworld projection still had some power left and thus
it was also able to resist the terrifying crimson flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Daolord Redgem
was simply too fast. Although he was weaker than King Gorsch, in a
real battle there was no way King Gorsch would be able to stop him
through speed alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” King Gorsch
let out an enraged roar as he waved his hand. Instantly, an enormous
illusory formation descended to cover an area of a hundred million
kilometers, with Daolord Redgem naturally being caught inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” A look of
despair appeared on Daolord Redgem’s face when he saw the formation
descend, and he let out an enraged howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you really think
a Voidsea Jadeseal would end up with someone like you?” King Gorsch
smirked, his hands suddenly expanding to become incredibly vast. His
hands were so large as to blanket the skies, and he delivered a
smashing blow towards Daolord Redgem. His hands were so vast that
there was no way for Daolord Redgem to dodge at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! As the enormous
palms came smashing down, they crashed straight against Daolord
Redgem! The barrier of black light surrounding Daolord Redgem’s
body began to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die for me.” King
Gorsch launched one frenzied attack after another, and Daolord Redgem
was able to do nothing but endure the blows despite his despair.
Alas, King Gorsch’s attacks were simply far too strong. Sectlord
Timedream’s heartworld projection and King Gorsch’s crimson
flames were already comparable to full-force attacks from second-tier
Daolords, but the actual, frenzied strikes of King Gorsch were a full
level higher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! After
taking a total of twenty-one palms, the black light covering Daolord
Redgem’s body finally began to dim and fade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Daolord
Redgem clutched the seal tightly, his eyes filled with despair and
resentment. “If I can’t have it, no one can!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to shatter
it… but alas, he wasn’t able to damage it in the slightest! This
was an item created from the incredibly precious material known as
voidsea jade, a priceless treasure. Even Emperor Waveshift had been
forced to rely on secret smithing techniques to forge it and had been
just barely able to slice it apart. There were no Daolords who were
capable of actually destroying this thing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Yet another
massive palm came crashing down. This time, Daolord Redgem died
almost instantly, with both his soul and truesoul being completely
extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it’s mine!”
King Gorsch waved his hand, collecting all of Daolord Redgem’s
treasures and grabbing the Voidsea Jadeseal. He poured just a bit of
his Immortal energy into it, verifying that it was indeed what he
sought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea Jadeseal
is mine!” King Gorsch’s eyes turned mad with excitement. “No
one can take it from me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go!” King
Gorsch didn’t waste any time at all, immediately departing from
this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch has
already acquired the Voidsea Jadeseal.” The Heartforce Cultivators
within the Waveshift Realm were all chatting mentally with each other
and thus quickly learned this information.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Sectlord
Timedream was using his projection to suppress that region, making it
impossible for Ning and the others to investigate the area, Sectlord
Timedream had to tell all the other Heartforce Cultivators what was
going on. Otherwise, they would use their own heartworld projections
to cause trouble and interfere with his actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It fell into the
hands of King Gorsch?” The Ninedust Sectlord began to worry. “He’s
incredibly powerful, and a member of the Aeonians. Once the Aeonians
activate their Aeonian bloodlines, they can become even more
powerful. It’ll be incredibly hard for anyone to seize the seal
from him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.
Sectlord Timedream and the others won’t let King Gorsch just do as
he pleases,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was
worried as well… but all they could do for now was to hurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as King Gorsch was
fleeing, a terrifyingly strong heartworld projection came crashing
down upon him, suppressing him. Right at this moment, the four
Daolords who had been accompanying Daolord Redgem suddenly felt the
pressure being lifted off of them, allowing them to instantly relax.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Calamitous
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream!” King
Gorsch let out a furious howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gorsch, you can
forget about leaving with the Voidsea Jadeseal!” Sectlord Timedream
was filled with the desire to kill as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
another squad of Daolords arrived in the area. This was a squad of
eight Daolords, and their gazes instantly turned towards the enraged
King Gorsch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch has the
Voidsea Jadeseal on him,” Sectlord Timedream sent mentally to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redgem’s four
companion Daolords shouted frantically from afar, “King Gorsch has
the Voidsea Jadeseal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s join forces
to kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s swear
lifeblood oaths to work together and not to attack each other. As for
who will end up with the Voidsea Jadeseal after King Gorsch is dead,
it’ll be up to whoever is the fastest!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
twelve Daolords didn’t hesitate at all, immediately joining
together into a new alliance. They understood that Sectlord Timedream
was using them, but they didn’t mind being used, because they did
indeed want to acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal! Once they did, they
would immediately flee. Daolord Redgem had a shot at escaping, and he
had only died because he had been trapped inside a formation. This
type of trap formation treasure was extremely rare; if they were
lucky, they’d be able to escape without encountering another one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” King Gorsch
found the situation tricky as well. For twelve second-tier Daolords
to join forces against him… they would indeed pose a huge threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to leave as
soon as possible and flee as far as I can. I can’t waste time
here.” King Gorsch knew that if he spent too much time here, more
and more Daolords would arrive and attack him. There were ‘only’
twelve now, but if he delayed any further there might be twenty or
even fifty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! While fighting
back, King Gorsch continued to flee and strive to pull away from
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
one day at a time. King Gorsch’s movements were all fully tracked
by the heartworld projections, but just tracking him was of no use.
The Waveshift Realm was simply too vast, and it was filled with many
dangers! It would take time for others to move towards him, making it
difficult for anyone to stop him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch had long
ago thrown off the pursuit of the first twelve Daolords. He had
suffered seven more attacks along the way, and in his frenzied
struggles he had slain six Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Daolords have
all gone mad. When they realize they can’t beat me, they
immediately start to use their most precious treasures.” King
Gorsch had suffered severe injuries and was forced to rely on
spirit-pills to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, these supreme
Daolords would only use their life-preserving treasures in true
life-and-death situations. But now, they were using their most
important treasures without any hesitation at all! This caused even
King Gorsch to be put in a precarious situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch.” A
deep, rumbling voice rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch was
startled. He stared up ahead, only to see a man dressed in heavy gray
armor whose eyes glowed with green light. The man said in a low
voice, “I’ve been chasing after you for a full day. I’ve
finally caught you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve caught me?
Then you can die now.” The crimson flames surrounding King Gorsch
exploded wildly, instantly reaching out towards the heavily-armored
man. The crimson flames crackled around the man, but he seemed to
completely ignore them as he strode forward, moving lightning-fast
through the skies and causing space itself to shudder around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” King Gorsch
waved his right hand, sending a blow of incredible power towards the
heavily-armored man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heavily-armored man
didn’t pull out any weapons at all. All he did was just lower his
head and smash right into the palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud. A deep and low
sound could be heard. King Gorsch’s palm-strike hit the
heavily-armored man on his neck, but the man’s body just trembled
slightly as he continued his headlong charge. King Gorsch himself was
sent flying backwards by the terrifying shockwave generated from the
collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” King
Gorsch immediately turned pale. “Not only did he easily take my
full-strength strike head-on, he’s still continuing his charge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His attacks were
legendary for their dominating nature, but he had already been put on
the defensive with the first clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” A giant
warhammer suddenly appeared in the heavily-armored man’s right
hand. The warhammer was pitch-black in color, and he sent it smashing
straight towards King Gorsch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch had been
tied down. After fleeing nonstop for nine days, he had finally been
forced to stop, and the person who stopped him was known as Daolord
Tigrone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch did his
best to struggle, going so far as to set alight his Aeonian blood. He
even used up one of his most valuable life-preserving treasures, but
he still wasn’t able to shake off Daolord Tigrone. All he could do
was flee as the latter continued the chase. The repeated assaults
from Daolord Tigrone, however, ensured that King Gorsch’s escaping
speed was dramatically lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch has been
tied down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Superb!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream,
Winesage, and the other Heartforce Cultivators all felt relieved.
They were simply too far away from King Gorsch, and there was no way
to stop him merely through their heartworld projections.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord Tigrone
is quite powerful. He seems to be even stronger than Gorsch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The supreme Daolords
who prefer to live low-key lives have all shown up here. It won’t
be easy for anyone to acquire a Voidsea Jadeseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two in the ninth
layer will be comparatively easier. The other three are in the tenth
layer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartforce
Cultivators continued to chat mentally to each other. Actually
acquiring a seal was just the first step; escaping with it was what
really mattered. In addition, escaping from the tenth layer would be
much harder than escaping from the ninth layer. Escaping with the
first two seals would thus be comparatively easier, while escaping
with the final three seals would be murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust, and the
others aboard the black vessel all let out sighs of relief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Tigrone is
incredibly powerful. His protective divine ability seems to be even
more powerful than mine; King Gorsch’s attacks aren’t injuring
him in the slightest,” Ning said. “And his weapon is a heavy
warhammer. Each time King Gorsch blocks the warhammer head-on, he’s
knocked flying backwards. Daolord Tigrone is clearly stronger than
even King Gorsch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did he even
come from?” The Ninedust Sectlord muttered, “How can he be this
strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supposedly, he’s
an Aberrant special lifeform. He had always been quite low-key
amongst the Aberrants; who would’ve thought that he had actually
reached an incredible level of strength?” Ning was conversing with
the other Heartforce Cultivators and so knew quite a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was guaranteed that
this battle would propel Daolord Tigrone to the heights of fame as
his name spread throughout the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
one day at a time. King Gorsch continued to run, while Daolord
Tigrone continued to pursue and attack! Every so often, other Daolord
squads would also appear, and all of them sought to kill King Gorsch!
In his madness, King Gorsch actually managed to kill another two
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The frenzied pursuit
went on for more than seven months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Tigrone, if
you are willing to spare me, you can ask for any treasure you want.
In fact, I’ll give you all the treasures I have, save for the
Voidsea Jadeseal!” As King Gorsch continued to flee, he frantically
tried to dissuade Daolord Tigrone from causing his trouble. Daolord
Tigrone’s constant interference made it so that he was fleeing much
more slowly than before, allowing Ning’s squad and Winesage to
slowly draw closer and closer to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this continued,
sooner or later he would be completely surrounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only thing I
want is the jade seal.” Daolord Tigrone completely ignored his
offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you all
of my treasures as well as a billion cubes of chaos nectar. When I
get back to my race’s kingdom, I’ll immediately prepare a billion
cubes for you!” King Gorsch was frantic. “I can immediately swear
a lifeblood oath if you stop causing me trouble!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t able to
beat the man. Flee? In truth, Daolord Tigrone was actually a bit
slower than King Gorsch, but Sectlord Timedream was continuously
using his heartworld projection to suppress King Gorsch, preventing
him from speeding up and ensuring that he wasn’t able to shake off
Daolord Tigrone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha… King
Gorsch, long time no see.” A dazzling streak of light suddenly
appeared off in the distance, looking as though a sun had suddenly
arisen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Eh?” King Gorsch’s
face turned ashen when he saw who it was. It was a white-robed youth
who had dazzling long golden hair and handsome features. “The
Radiant King.” King Gorsch’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Tigrone was
already tough enough to deal with. Now, the Radiant King had come as
well? The Radiant King had once ranked in the top three. Although he
had been shoved down to the fourth spot due to Daolord Dreamlore, he
was still terrifyingly powerful and the fastest of all Daolords. If
King Gorsch wasn’t even able to shake off Daolord Tigrone, there
was no way he would be able to shake off someone like the Radiant
King, the fastest person in this entire realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the
Voidsea Jadeseal. You are no longer able to keep it.” The Radiant
King slowly walked forwards, seeming to move slow but in truth moving
far faster than the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no… this Voidsea
Jadeseal is mine!” King Gorsch let out a low growl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! His aura once
more exploded as a bloody pattern appeared on his face, his eyes
filled with madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who bar my
path will die!” King Gorsch had gone mad. He had decided to first
kill the Radiant King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Tigrone’s
protective divine ability was the most terrifying protective ability
King Gorsch had ever seen! No other Daolords, not even Winesage,
would dare to allow King Gorsch to strike them with impunity, but
Daolord Tigrone did… and he wasn’t injured at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Radiant King was
incredibly fast, but his defenses were much weaker by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Radiant
King let out a cold laugh. Whooooosh. Instantly, a dazzling amount of
light was released from him as countless Radiant Kings appeared in
the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One hour later, a
shocking bit of information spread throughout the Waveshift Realm.
King Gorsch… had been killed!

Chapter 10 - A Distant Figure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch had died?
The number one Daolord of the Aeonian race, King Gorsch, had actually
died? This news swept through the Waveshift Realm and stunned all of
the Daolords in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Gorsch fled for
nearly eight months. During this period of time, Daolord Tigrone
didn’t injure him all that much; he mainly served to tie King
Gorsch down. The ones who truly hurt him and beat him down were the
various Daolord squads that interrupted and attacked him throughout
his flight. They knew that their chances were slim, and so virtually
all of them used the most powerful treasures they had available.
Those repeated attacks caused King Gorsch to suffer extremely heavy
injuries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Radiant King and
Daolord Tigrone fought him for a full hour. Eventually, King Gorsch’s
ignition of his bloodline powers began to have aftereffects,
resulting in him weakening. Right at that moment, the Radiant King
used an incredibly powerful treasure to kill him with one blow,” Ji
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
imagined that the legendary King Gorsch would die, just like that.”
Daolord Solesky shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is guaranteed
that a large number of Daolords will die in the Waveshift Realm,”
Badlands said. “Everyone knows that, but they still came rushing
in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The black
vessel continued its advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity. We would’ve
caught up to King Gorsch in roughly half a month.” Ning frowned.
“Now that the Voidsea Jadeseal is in the hands of the Radiant King…
catching up to him will be difficult!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Gorsch died. The
Radiant King acquired the seal, then immediately began to flee. He
was simply too fast; even though Sectlord Timedream used his
heartworld projection to slow the Radiant King’s movements, the
latter was still able to move more than a hundred times faster than
the speed of light! There was no way for Daolord Tigrone to catch up.
Daolord Tigrone used all the resources he had at his disposal, but
the Radiant King did the same. The Radiant King quickly threw off
Daolord Tigrone’s pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee! Flee! Flee! This
was the only thing the Radiant King cared about. As for Ning and the
other Heartforce Cultivators, they were able to clearly lock down
upon his position and quickly spread the word to the other Daolord
squads, who moved to intercept and attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Radiant King
ignored their attempts to stop them, avoiding them and fleeing
whenever possible. His only goal was to throw off all pursuers as
quickly as possible. When he was unable to do so, he would kill them
at maximum speed while sparing no expense! The Radiant King’s three
killer moves were all legendary for their speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
two years had gone by. Given the Radiant King’s terrifying speed,
there were no Daolords capable of tying him down! Even though the
Starking managed to intercept him, the Radiant King still threw him
off! He spent two years to flee from the ninth layer to the eighth
layer. Since he was returning via the same way he had come, he was
able to avoid many of the dangerous regions he had previously scouted
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, there were
virtually no powerful Daolords in the eighth layer. After another
half year, he made it back to the seventh layer… and by then there
was no one capable of posing a threat to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that the first Voidsea Jadeseal would end up in the hands of the
Radiant King.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s simply too
fast. No temporal or dimensional teleportation abilities can be used
in the Waveshift Realm, and so there is no one faster than him here.
He held a huge, unfair advantage over everyone.” The other Daolords
all felt quite helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Waveshift had
spent an enormous amount of time and effort creating and setting up
this Grand Waveshift Formation. All dimensional and temporal
abilities were sealed away here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a number of
supreme Daolords who had spacetime teleportation devices which were
comparable to the spacetime disc which Ning had acquired from the
Brightshore Hegemon, but there was no way to use them here. King
Gorsch, the Radiant King… all Daolords who acquired Voidsea
Jadeseal talismans would be forced to physically flee. If they
escaped, the treasure would be theirs. If they failed, they would be
doomed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces of
Brightshore. The Spacetime Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Prince
Greatjoy, the other dazzling genius the Spacetime Palace had recently
produced was known as Gorho.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gorho had been captured
alongside Ning, but he was comparatively slower in his cultivation.
He had just become a Daolord roughly ten thousand years ago, and had
only recently become a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Gorho was
located within the ‘Spacetime Dreamrealm’ of the Spacetime
Palace. He had been seated in the lotus position within a chaos
planet and quietly meditating, but he suddenly opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father…” Gorho
could sense something deep within his very bloodline tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father… father…”
Gorho’s eyes instantly reddened. “H-how could he have died…”
After becoming a Daolord, he had created an avatar which had been
stationed amongst the Aeonians. He naturally was amongst the first to
receive word of King Gorsch’s death. He was the most promising
descendant of King Gorsch, who cared about him greatly and had paved
the way for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gorho felt tremendous
love and affection towards his father. His father was the most
important person in his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Radiant King!”
Gorho’s eyes were blood-red but filled with tears. He howled,
“Radiant King, I’m definitely going to kill you! I’m going to
KILL YOU!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, his
world was filled with nothing but hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Daolords had
worked themselves into a frenzy over the first Voidsea Jadeseal. In
the end, the Radiant King left with it and successfully escaped, no
longer taking part in any of the other battles that were to come. In
truth, he himself had been terrified by this experience. When he had
fled, he had been waylaid by one group of Daolords after another. He
had previously held many of those Daolords in little regard, but when
they joined forces they were still tremendously dangerous to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Ning and
the others shook their heads and sighed. “All that chasing for
nothing.” There was nothing they could do. They had been pulling
closer and closer to King Gorsch, but the Radiant King had steadily
pulled away from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. There
are five of those Voidsea Jadeseals. That was just the first one,”
the Ninedust Sectlord said. “We still have a shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But those two hunts
were simply terrifying,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes they were.”
Ning shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Redgem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Qianqing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendking Nobleguard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had been
famous Daolords. Now, they were nothing. King Gorsch had slain
nineteen Daolords during his flight, while the Radiant King had
killed seven more after slaying King Gorsch and escaping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In total, twenty-six
Daolords had perished… and that wasn’t including King Gorsch! Of
the twenty-six, there were twenty-four who had been on the same level
as Kongsan! The other two were on the same level as Solesky and
Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many powerful
Daolords have died in an incredibly short period of time. One of the
top ten died as well!” The Ninedust Sectlord said heavily, “Of
the four remaining seals, one is in the ninth layer while the other
three are in the even more dangerous tenth layer. I really wonder how
many Daolords will end up dying. Quite a few of the top ten will die,
I think.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a blurry
streak of rainbow light appeared in the skies. Ning and the others
all raised their heads, only to see a white-robed man’s figure
slowly coalesce from the light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul Polo.”
Countless images of Realmsoul Polo had appeared within the Waveshift
Realm, and each one of them stared down at a group of Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first Voidsea
Jadeseal has already been taken away by the Daolord known as the
Radiant King.” The realmsoul’s voice echoed throughout heaven and
earth. “It seems as though there is no way any of the other
Daolords will be able to take it from him. Thus… I’ll go ahead
and make public the location of the second Voidsea Jadeseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Daolords
immediately held their breaths. This was the second and final Voidsea
Jadeseal within the ninth layer. After their previous experience,
they all now knew how deadly the fight over it would be and how hard
it would be to take it away safely. The weaker Daolords probably
wouldn’t even dare to enter the tenth layer and seek out the seals
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second Voidsea
Jadeseal is the last one the vast majority of you Daolords will have
a shot at acquiring,” Realmsoul Polo said. “This is because only
the most supreme of Daolords have a chance at surviving the region
where the final three seals are located. If weaker Daolords attempt
to go there, they’ll definitely perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely perish?”
Ning and many of the others were shocked. The vast majority of them
were second-tier Daolords or even weaker third-tier Daolords like
Solesky and Patriarch Clearwind. Judging from what the realmsoul had
just said, even second-tier Daolords would definitely perish if they
entered. They wouldn’t even have a chance at the final three seals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, Daolords… do
your best if you want to earn the second seal. Once this opportunity
is gone, you won’t have another one!” Realmsoul Polo seemed to
want to cause as much chaos as possible. He waved his finger, then
pointed directly towards Ning’s location. “The second Voidsea
Jadeseal is right there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A pillar of light
erupted from behind them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust,
Solesky, and Badlands all turned their heads, only to see that the
beam of light rising up from a nearby river. Obviously, the Voidsea
Jadeseal was right inside the river!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s right there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were that close
to it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s right next to
us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust,
Solesky, and Badlands were all stunned. The seal was incredibly close
to them; they would probably be able to dive into the river in less
than a second!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move, move, move!”
Ning sent a frantic mental message to the others. “Be careful of
the heartworld projection!” As he spoke, he immediately unleashed
his nine novessence arts and also used his own heartworld projection
to cover and protect his people. Based on what Ning knew, Sectlord
Timedream would probably immediately use his heartworld projection to
crush and suppress them. Him and Ninedust would be able to endure it,
and Solesky would probably be able to just barely survive it thanks
to his invulnerable aquaform, but Badlands’ avatar wouldn’t be
able to endure it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
immediately unleashed his Ripplewater art as well, then charged
straight towards the river. “Do your best, everyone. Whoever is the
first one to find the Voidsea Jadeseal will become its owner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see who is
the first to find it!” Ning, Solesky, and Badlands all flew towards
the river as well.

Chapter 11 - The Focal Spot
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second Voidsea
Jadeseal is the only shot we have. We have to acquire it, no matter
what the cost!” This was what the vast majority of the frantic
Daolords within the ninth layer were thinking. Realmsoul Polo’s
words had let them realize that the final three seals were out of
their grasp, with only the most supreme of Daolords having a shot at
them. This naturally meant that they were all the more frantic to
acquire the second seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later,
Realmsoul Polo pointed towards a certain direction. “There’s
where it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, hurry!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to go there
at maximum speed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Daolords
within the ninth layer frantically charged towards that direction. As
for the Daolords who were in the eighth layer, they all shared the
same hope: “Perhaps the ones who acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal will
flee in our general direction with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
heartworld projection after another descended upon the location of
the second Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most supreme
Daolords, including Sectlord Timedream and Daolord Tigrone, were just
as anxious as the weaker Daolords. Daolord Tigrone’s displayed
prowess in continuously holding the upper hand in his fight against
King Gorsch had caused the Palace of Immortals to once more update
its rankings. King Gorsch had completely vanished from the list, with
Daolord Tigrone assuming his original position at number seventh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
the closest to that position.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth and
Solesky of Vastheaven Palace are over there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartforce
Cultivators all conversed with each other regarding this. Prior to
this, Ning had been a member of this informal association as well,
but with him being the closest to the second Voidsea Jadeseal he was
obviously now the common enemy of all other Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll suppress
them,” Sectlord Timedream immediately sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Delay them and trap
them as quickly as possible,” Winesage sent mentally. Winesage was
feeling quite frantic as well. Judging from how things were shaking
out with the first and second seals, power mattered but luck mattered
just as much! Although Winesage was without question the most
powerful Daolord present, if he was too far away he would have no
shot at acquiring on, no matter how much he wanted one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this took time
to describe, in truth it happened almost instantly. Sectlord
Timedream’s heartworld projection came crashing down, suppressing
Ning, Ninedust, Solesky, and Badlands as they ran.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
nine novessence arts and the Ripplewater art blasted out, fighting
back against Sectlord Timedream’s heartworld projection. Ning’s
own heartworld projection came crashing out as well, doing its best
to disrupt Timedream’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own heartworld
projection ended up crumbling repeatedly, but the nine novessence
arts and the Ripplewater arts were able to hold on despite shuddering
and shaking. Ning, Solesky, Ninedust, and Badlands weren’t impeded
or slowed down in the slightest, and they charged straight towards
that nearby river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, Daolord
Darknorth and his squad are closest to this second seal. Their squad
includes Daolord Solesky and Daolord Badlands.” Sectlord Timedream
immediately sent this information to the squads of Daolords who were
closest to that area. “They have incredibly powerful secret arts
and a heartworld projection at all, allowing them to just barely
negate the power of my heartworld projection. You have to be careful
when fighting them, gentlemen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth’s
squad?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace
truly is lucky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to stop
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby squads of
Daolords all frantically charged towards Ning’s position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!” Winesage
had an ugly look on his face, his black robes fluttering in the wind.
“The second one is almost as far from me as the previous one was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first Voidsea
Jadeseal had been very far away from Winesage; Ning’s group had
been much closer by comparison. The second Voidsea Jadeseal was a bit
closer, but as everyone had chased after King Gorsch they had
naturally began to draw closer and closer to each other. Compared to
where the other Daolords were located, Winesage was still very far
away from Ning’s squad!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
going on? Am I experiencing bad luck to balance out my overwhelming
advantage in power?” An anxious look was in Winesage’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Although he was
enraged and anxious, he still charged straight towards Ning’s
direction. They were fairly far away, and there were a number of
supreme Daolords much closer than him. Despite that, he still moved
towards Ning’s direction. So long as he had a chance, he wouldn’t
give it up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them dove
into the water, one after the other. Ninedust was the fastest, Ning
was second, Solesky was third, and Badlands was last. However, since
they were all so close to the river, there really wasn’t much of a
difference between them as they dove in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the Voidsea
Jadeseal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was the first
to dive into the water, and he stared downwards as he frantically
sought the seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s coming from
over there!” This river was so incredibly wide and deep it had some
underwater mountains and valleys at the bottom. The white pillar of
light was coming from one of those underwater valleys.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ninedust
immediately charged towards that gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over there!”
Ning was just a heartbeat slower, and he immediately flew towards
that gorge as well. Solesky and Badlands quickly followed right
behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all very good
friends, but this matter involved their chances at the Daomerge. None
of them would give up this opportunity for mere friendship! They had
agreed long ago that the seal would go to whoever managed to acquire
it! Even when Solesky had first asked Badlands to help out, the
latter had agreed to send his avatar partially out of a desire to
acquire a different treasure known as the ‘Heartshift Pearl’.
Heartshift Pearls were also useful in the Daomerge, but it was
unfathomably inferior to the Voidsea Jadeseals, which allowed you to
artificially induce a Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Badlands
didn’t care all that much about the Heartshift Pearl, but he did
desperately want a Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! The four charge deep into the underwater gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is it? Where
is the seal?” After charging into the gorge, Ning’s first
instinct was to use his heartworld projection to scan every inch of
it. Alas, he wasn’t able to find any trace of it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The
Ninedust Sectlord struck out with his longstaff, sending it outwards
in an incredibly powerful smashing blow towards the surrounding area.
But of course, he made sure to avoid hitting Ning, Solesky, or
Badlands. They had long ago sworn a lifeblood oath not to harm each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
entire underwater gorge began to crumble apart as the water and the
stone were both vaporized by the strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky and Badlands
began to frantically assault the underwater gorge as well, as did
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. Nothing!”
Ninedust was incredibly anxious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has to be in this
gorge. It has to be!” The four continued their furious assault
against the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Daolord Solesky
delivered a vicious punch, causing the dense stone face of one
particular mountain to break apart. Inside there was a stone pillar,
and atop the stone pillar hovered a round piece of jade that emanated
a milky-white aura of light. It was the Voidsea Jadeseal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Ning, Ninedust, and Badlands all turned to look towards Solesky’s
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky stared
blankly for a second, then immediately punched out again and smashed
apart the protective formation around the stone pillar. He easily
shattered the formation, then reached out to grab the Voidsea
Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Ninedust
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky…” Ning had a mixed look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t unable to
divine any of this through my Numerancy at all…” Badlands shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were all
lifelong friends, this was a supreme Daomerge treasure. None of them
would give way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the fastest
and the strongest… and yet, in the end you were the one to win the
treasure, Solesky. I really didn’t expect this.” Ninedust shook
his head. “I have nothing to say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was
overwhelmed with delight. The four of them had been working together
to destroy the gorge and find the Voidsea Jadeseal, but he just so
happened to be right next to it. A single lucky punch from him had
shattered the stone pillar hiding the Voidsea Jadeseal! It naturally
fell into his hands. Ninedust and Ning didn’t even have a chance to
try and intercept him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, I won out
of pure luck. However, what really matters right now is escaping with
this thing. I’m confident that the nearby Daolords will soon
arrive,” Daolord Solesky sent frantically towards Ning and the
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you
thinking? Are you hoping for us to help you in your escape?” The
Ninedust Sectlord frowned and said in an icy voice, “The escape
will be incredibly dangerous. Even King Gorsch died when trying to
flee with the seal! If we try to help you escape, we’ll probably
die as well, and even if we survive we won’t be the ones to benefit
from the Voidsea Jadeseal. Why the hell should we help you? That’s
not even mentioning the fact that you are so weak, you wouldn’t
even be able to help us out when fighting those enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were on
the same team and had sworn oaths not to harm each other, that didn’t
mean they all had to risk their lives for each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I… I realize I
asked for too much.” Daolord Solesky’s face went blank for a
moment, but he quickly recovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
don’t fight back.” Ning waved his hand, causing Daolord Solesky
to be drawn into his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what the
hell?” The Ninedust Sectlord was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky
once saved my live, and we are both brothers of Vastheaven Palace.
How can I just wash my hands of him?” Ning shook his head. “Don’t
worry about this, brother Ninedust. I’m not exactly helpless. I’ll
flee for as long as I can. If I feel like I really don’t have a
chance to escape, I’ll just hand the seal over.”
</P>

Chapter 12 - Fleeing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” The
Ninedust Sectlord was speechless. He actually had harbored ulterior
motives; he wanted to wait for Daolord Solesky to be killed by other
Daolords, then counter-attack and take the seal for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, he really
didn’t have much of a relationship with Solesky. However, him and
Ji Ning and experienced life-and-death experiences for many years,
and he really did view Ning as an extremely close friend. He was by
nature an arrogant and solitary figure, willing and capable of doing
anything and everything necessary to achieve his goals. If he didn’t
like someone, he wouldn’t give a damn about them even if they were
stronger than him… but once he did acknowledge a person, he would
be willing to risk his life for the sake of that friend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit. You drive me
crazy. Fine, let’s escape together.” The Ninedust Sectlord
gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I want to make
my position clear - if I’m unable to hold them off any longer, we
need to voluntarily hand the Voidsea Jadeseal over. I’m not gonna
commit suicide for someone else.” The Ninedust Sectlord let out a
cold snort. “For Daolord Solesky to have a brother like you who is
willing to risk your life for him… he really has some bullshit
luck. If it wasn’t for you, his chances of escaping with the seal
would be virtually negligible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was both overjoyed
and moved by this. This escape would be an incredibly dangerous
endeavor. King Gorsch had died just a while ago, and this time the
Daolords would probably be even more frenzied in their attempts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thanks, Ninedust.”
Ning silently committed this display of friendship to memory. He knew
that this would be a day he would never be able to forget.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we work
together, it won’t be easy for anyone to stop us,” Ninedust sent
mentally. “Alright, let’s cut the crap. Time to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
briefly bickered, given their level of power their mental
conversations happened almost instantaneously. Less than a single
second had passed since Ning had collected Daolord Solesky. It was
now time to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splash! The flying
black vessel suddenly burst through the surface of the river, with
Ning, Ninedust, and Badland atop the vessel. Ning took control over
the vessel, not hesitating at all in sending it back the way they had
previously come. That way, they would be able to avoid all of the
natural dangers within the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t!”
Daolord Badlands opened his eyes and suddenly let out a furious
shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning turned to look at Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I engaged in some
detailed Numerancy just now. If we go back the same way we came, I
think we are destined to fail. I can’t divine any way to survive if
we go back that way, and I can foretell that the battles we will
encounter shall be far more terrible than the ones King Gorsch
endured.” Daolord Badlands pointed towards the left instead. “All
other directions will result in guaranteed failure. I can sense that
our only chance will come from that direction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and
Ninedust exchanged a glance. They had all sworn lifeblood oaths when
establishing the squad to tell each other the truth. There was no way
Daolord Badlands was lying to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, they
themselves knew that due to everyone having chased after King Gorsch,
all the various Daolord squads were now much closer to each other
than before. As a result, there was a very high concentration of
Daolords in the area around Ning. Their flight would be much more
dangerous than King Gorsch’s failed attempt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands was
now telling them that all other paths, including the path they had
originally traversed to come here, would result in certain failure.
This was a testament to how dangerous this would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens always
leave a chance; they never seal off hope entirely. It seems our only
hope lies in that direction.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all,
immediately sending the vessel flying at high speeds towards the
direction Daolord Badlands had just pointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They aren’t going
back the same way they came! They’re advancing towards an
unexplored area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream,
Winesage, and the other Heartforce Cultivators continued to mentally
converse with each other. When they had pursued King Gorsch, they had
paid close attention to the path King Gorsch was taking. While doing
so, they had also mentally memorized the paths which the various
squads of Daolords had taken, including Ji Ning’s. Daolords
naturally had terrifyingly good memories, and they thus remembered
exactly what route Ning had taken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought they
would go back the same way they came! I arranged for other Daolords
to intercept and attack them, but they’re instead fleeing in a
different direction. Quite crafty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and stop
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie them down! The
longer we can tie them down, the more Daolords will be able to make
it there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
began to converse mentally with the various other Daolord squads,
arranging them like chess pieces. And in truth, those Daolords were
willing to serve as chess pieces for the chance of acquiring a
Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
a Heartforce Cultivator and has many unpredictable heartforce attacks
we would be forced to take head-on. His avatar was capable of slaying
Daolord Mistbearer, and his true body should be even stronger. My
Dao-heart is lacking; I’m not going to take part in this ambush.
Good luck, fellow Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas, it seems like
I won’t have any chances this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weaker Daolords and
the ones with flawed Dao-hearts began to slow down. They weren’t
willing to face a Heartforce Cultivator head-on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although King Gorsch
was formidable, they were at least able to see and defend against his
attacks when they worked together. Heartforce attacks, however, were
invisible and could only be taken head-on. If you were able to endure
the attacks, you’d live; if you failed, you would die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh! Many other
Daolords, however, continued to rush there at high speeds. Only a
fairly small percentage were afraid of Ning! The most powerful
second-tier Daolords didn’t really fear each other. As for the
supreme first-tier Daolords, they felt no fear at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning continued
to flee at high speeds aboard the black vessel. Previously, when he
had his heartworld projection active, he had marked down the various
paths which the other Daolord squads had taken. This now proved to be
quite useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There they are!”
Ninedust bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first Daolord
squad.” Ning waved his hand and put away Daolord Badlands, then
stared intently towards the front. They had fled for roughly the time
needed to boil a kettle of tea… and a squad of Daolords had
appeared. This was the first one, and there were eight of them off in
the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. The sides
drew closer and closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth is
nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Daolords were
filled with a murderous intent and had savage looks on their faces.
As they saw it, King Gorsch was much stronger than this Daolord
Darknorth ever could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vanish.” Six of
the eight Daolords didn’t hesitate in immediately taking out rare
treasures. These six were second-tier Daolords, while the other two
were fairly weak and were just trying their luck out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was brimming with killing intent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dreamstar!” Ning
immediately executed his [Dreamstar] art. Given that these eight
dared to attack him head-on, the [Heartforce Eradicator] probably
wouldn’t be of much use against them! Thus, Ning chose to
immediately use the [Dreamstar] instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Invisible waves of
heartforce instantly surged out towards the eight Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Junior Radiant
King, Daolord Yanmi, had been briefly affected by Ning’s usage of
the [Dreamstar] art… and Ning’s true body was even stronger!
These Daolords were obviously not a match for the Junior Radiant
King, and six of them were instantly driven into an spellbound state.
Only two of the Daolords were able to maintain their clarity of mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that they had
fallen into a state of stupor, they obviously wouldn’t be able to
activate the power within their treasures. Ning himself would need a
moment of time to take out and activate the Sword Hegemon’s
Dao-seal! Its power would be unleashed in accordance with his
guidance; without it, it would just burst out in a straight line that
would be much more easily dodged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Terrifying black light, awesome thunder, endless blades of icy light…
without guidance from their masters, they began to randomly collide
against each other. Even the two Daolords who were able to maintain
their clarity of mind were disrupted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fools like them
think to stop us?” The Ninedust Sectlord let out a bellow, then
struck out with his longstaff. His longstaff stretched out to become
a million kilometers long, howling through the skies and splattering
apart a dangerous streak of bloody light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to
shatter the power of that Dao-seal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?” The two clear-minded Daolords were shocked by what they
saw. Only supreme first-tier Daolords would be able to unleash such
power with a casual strike. That attack had more might within it than
a powerful Dao-seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The Ninedust
Sectlord charged forwards valiantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning
continuously executed the [Dreamstar] while also sending out his nine
novessence arts like nine energy dragons towards the eight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though the
Ripplewater art and the nine novessence arts were being suppressed
Sectlord Timedream, they were still able to strike out across a great
distance towards those Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run, quick!” By
now, three of the six dazed Daolords had come back to their senses.
They immediately screamed mentally to each other, “His illusions
are too powerful. Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, how could they
possibly flee more quickly than the nine novessence arts or the
Ripplewater art? They were instantly surrounded and bogged down. The
three still-dazed Daolords were unable to resist at all, and two of
them died on the spot! A heartbeat later, the Ninedust Sectlord’s
staff came howling for them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run! Run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a supreme
Daolord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A supreme Daolord
and a Heartforce Cultivator, working together! We aren’t a match
for them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had thought that
this squad would be easy pickings, but it was even more terrifying
than King Gorsch had been! If they were facing King Gorsch, the six
items they had just tossed out would’ve been more than enough to
put him in a tight spot. However, against the combined forces of Ning
and Ninedust, it had been of no use! They made up for each other’s
weaknesses. This was the reason why Daolord Soleman had joined forces
with Daolord Skyaxe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” The
Ninedust Sectlord flew back to the flying vessel. “I enjoyed the
hell out of that battle. How absolutely wonderful! If we had enough
time, we would’ve finished off those four as well. There’s no way
they should’ve been able to escape.” In the end, four of the
eight had died. The other four had managed to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Waveshift Realm,
it was generally fairly easy to kill second-tier Daolords, as normal
dimensional/temporal escape methods were of no use. The only choice
was to fly, which meant that many of the slower ones would easily
lose their lives if they were unable to beat an opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, when the
two of us work together, we might just be able to fight our way out
after all.” The Ninedust Sectlord chortled with laughter. “Hah!
Our reputations are really gonna be spread throughout the Endless
Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really aren’t
many who can stop us when we work together.” Ning grinned as well.
In his heart, he felt tremendous gratitude towards Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His big brother Solesky
had shown him great benevolence in the past; there was no way Ning
would just abandon him, but the same hadn’t been true for Ninedust.
Although both of them were in high spirits, they also knew that this
would be a very dangerous escape attempt… and the dangers had just
begun.

Chapter 13 - Fight
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ease with which Ji
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord had slaughtered the first squad to
attack them, forcing the attackers to flee in disarray, caused the
Heartforce Cultivators who were ‘spying’ on the fight to feel
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Who is that silver-robed man? How can he be this powerful?”
Winesage asked anxiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does anyone know who
the silver-robed man is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does anyone know
where he comes from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I know is that
he is an Ancient cultivator who is on par with me,” Fiendqueen
Dustrain replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since when did the
Ancient cultivators suddenly give birth to such a terrifyingly
powerful Daolord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartforce
Cultivators instantly began to spread this information to the other
Daolords and ask them about it. Of the many Daolords present, there
actually were a few who knew about Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient
cultivators do have an incredibly talented Daolord known as Redwater
who is skilled in staff-arts and walks the Dao of Water. He has
become the new Sectlord of the Ninedust Sect! However, when I knew
him he wasn’t nearly this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, when I used my
heartworld projection to suppress them, I overheard Daolord Darknorth
refer to him as ‘Ninedust’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust
Sectlord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Redwater,
the Ninedust Sectlord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were simply far
too many Daolords clustered within the Waveshift Realm. Even the most
low-key of Daolords would still be known to some. All Daolords had to
experience danger and train in order to grow more powerful. They’d
naturally run into other Daolords during the process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Daolords
present all understood that to withstand Darknorth and Ninedust would
be no easy task! Ninedust was already on par with King Gorsch, while
Darknorth was a Heartforce Cultivator. The two complimented each
other very well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” Ning
let out a furious roar as his heartforce surged out in a wave via his
[Dreamstar] art towards the five Daolords who had come to stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After going through the
Ancient Hegemon’s relic site, studying the Dreamdust script, and
traversing the Thundersouth Palace as well as using the Stone Censer
of Reunion for many years, Ning had reached an extremely high level
in the [Dreamstar] art. By now, his illusions were on par with even
the illusions that had been within the Thundersouth Palace, and even
Ninedust had repeatedly been tricked by the illusions in Thundersouth
Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning used this
technique, the vast majority of second-tier Daolords would be
affected by it. And in truth, this was nothing much. When Daolord
Featherdress had used her [Featherdress Soulthrall Song], no
non-Heartforce Cultivator Daolord was able to resist it, including
the other supreme first-tier Daolords! This was what made Heartforce
Cultivators so terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four of the five
Daolords were trapped within illusions. The remaining one, upon
seeing this, didn’t dare to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and the others didn’t want to waste any time. They immediately used
their flying vessel to escape at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?
How could we all have been trapped in illusions?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Dao-heart is
incredibly powerful. How did I end up within an illusion as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the other four
Daolords came to their senses, they were so frightened they felt cold
sweat drip down their banks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it hadn’t been
for Daolord Darknorth, the five of us could’ve joined forces to
cause the Ninedust Sectlord quite a few problems. Ugh. They’ve
joined forces. Blocking them is going to be extremely difficult.”
After personally experiencing the power of this combination, the
squad instantly understood how terrifyingly strong the Ning-Ninedust
team was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. The
Ning-Ninedust team was virtually unstoppable. Both of them had
extremely powerful secret arts, and Ning’s heartworld projection
was able to push back repeatedly at Sectlord Timedream’s heartworld
projection. Although his own projection was repeatedly destroyed by
Timedream’s, their secret arts were strong enough to allow them to
endure the rest. Thus, they weren’t slowed down in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as combat power
went? Although they were repeatedly outnumbered by second-tier
Daolords, Ning would cast his heartforce illusions upon them from
far, and the majority of them would immediately fall for it! There
was just no way to slow them down at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
Ning’s group had spent nineteen days in flight. On the way, they
had suffered quite a few attacks by Daolord squads, with two of the
attacks being quite difficult to deal with. They had fought at
maximum speed and managed to kill five of the Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and
Ninedust suddenly stared towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s off.”
Ning’s eyes narrowed as he stared towards a red-robed youth who was
flying towards them from afar. The red-robed youth’s eyes were
extremely bright, and they glistened like the stars. Ning had a heavy
look on his face. “He actually dares to intercept us by himself. He
knows how strong we are, but he still dares to challenge us. He is
very possibly a supreme Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Even worse, he
doesn’t seem to be one of the more famous ones. We have no idea
what his skills lie in.” Ninedust had a bad feeling as well. This
was the first time during their flight that a sole Daolord had moved
to intercept them by himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.
Brother Ninedust. My Daoist title is ‘Snowjoy’. I feel rather
embarrassed; this is our first time meeting each other, and we’re
about to get into a fight right away.” The red-robed youth laughed
brightly. “Why don’t you hand over the Voidsea Jadeseal. Now that
I’m here, you won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think quite
highly of yourself.” Ninedust smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, a cold
light flashed through his eyes as he immediately sent out his
[Dreamstar] art. The red-robed youth, however, just continued to
stand there with a smile on his face in front of them. When the
[Dreamstar] art swept past the man, the man simply continued to
smile. His smile had a strange charisma to it, and his eyes only
shone even brighter as he looked at Ninedust. “Brother Ninedust?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Ninedust Sectlord let out a cold snort. “So you are actually
skilled in illusions as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas, my illusions
can in no way compare to brother Darknorth’s. He is a true
Heartforce Cultivator, after all.” The red-robed youth smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face tightened
as he sent mentally to Ning, “Ninedust, my [Dreamstar] did nothing
to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is probably a
supreme Daolord! Supreme Daolords almost all have incredibly powerful
souls and Dao-hearts. Their souls won’t be easily shaken by
illusions. Don’t worry. Leave it to me.” The Ninedust Sectlord
glared coldly at the distant red-robed youth, then barked, “Daolord
Snowjoy? Hmph! Let’s see if you really are strong enough to bar my
path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you.” The
red-robed youth smiled gracefully, then flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
Ninedust Sectlord swept through the skies, his longstaff expanding to
become ten thousand kilometers long as he slammed it towards the
opponent in front of him. The space around him actually twisted into
a vortex, with that longstaff being at the center of the vortex as it
smashed towards the red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed youth
instantly manifested a total of six ivory-white arms. His six arms
spread out like the plumes of a peacock, launching palm-strikes,
finger-strikes, claw-strikes, and other attacks towards the Ninedust
Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! An extremely soft
and light collision could be heard. The red-robed youth’s body
trembled slightly before he then continued to press the attack
against Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The Ninedust
Sectlord spun his staff around his waist as he prepared for another
strike. The longstaff was like a Flood Dragon leaving the waters,
causing great waves to appear in the area that crashed downwards
towards the red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed youth’s
attacks were extremely graceful. No matter how ferocious the Ninedust
Sectlord’s attacks were, the youth was able to defend against them
with extremely delicate strikes. He was able to use his six hands
alone to defend against Ninedust’s longstaff without suffering the
slightest of disadvantages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grew increasingly
anxious as he watched. If this continued, the battle could go on for
several days without any resolution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning suddenly
vanished as he used his Shadowless evasion skill to move closer to
the red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to ambush
me?” The red-robed youth’s godsense had been activated this
entire time, and so he naturally was able to notice as Ning drew
close to him. He let out a soft laugh. “you are a Heartforce
Cultivator. If you hid far away, I wouldn’t be able to do anything
to you… but you actually dare to deliver yourself into my hands?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Six streams
of light appeared simultaneously as Ning manifested [Three Heads, Six
Arms] and sent his six Northbow swords to attack his opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw off.” The
red-robed youth casually waved a single hand to slap back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The tips of the
swords collided against the center of the red-robed youth’s palm.
The youth’s face instantly changed. He had thought that he would be
able to deliver a heavy blow to Ning with a single hand, but Ning had
used the most powerful attack available to him - the Blood Drop
stance. This stance, when used with the Northbow swords, contained
incredible power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning felt the
tremendous power contained within that palm-strike, the defensive
prowess of his sword-arts allowed him to deflect and ablate much of
that power with one sword. He also had the Hegemon armor, allowing
him to take on as much of the strike as possible so as to ensure that
his other five swords were not disrupted by the attack. Thus, the
other five Northbow swords continued to fly mercilessly towards the
red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you to screw
off!” The red-robed youth was irritated now. He sent three of his
ivory-white palms towards Ning in a fierce assault, his palms growing
in size as he slapped out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning
was knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The Ninedust
Sectlord suddenly landed a blow with his longstaff against the
red-robed youth’s waist, knocking him flying backwards as well. The
youth spat a mouthful of blood out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
red-robed youth quickly righted himself in midair, a look of anger in
his eyes as he smiled coldly towards the distant Ning. “Impressive,
Darknorth. I didn’t expect you to be this strong in close combat!
You caught me slightly off-guard… and you didn’t even spit out
any blood after taking a hit from me! Impressive, impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stronger than
he had expected. He had to use at least thirty to forty percent of
his power to deal with Ning, but this meant that he would no longer
be able to fend off the Ninedust Sectlord.

Chapter 14 - Daolord Shaka Bars Their Path
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you are
more powerful than I had expected. I’ve just developed an ultimate
attack that I’ve yet to display in front of other Daolords. The two
of you shall be the first one to see it.” the red-robed youth said
in a cold voice. His body began to glow with rays of astral light
that coalesced to his left and his right, forming two starlight
bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed youth and
his two starlight bodies looked absolutely identical to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Stargod clone?”
Ji Ning and Ninedust both exclaimed in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, these are
Stargod clones.” The red-robed youth smiled coldly. “This is the
supreme technique of the Starking, the ‘Stargod clones’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starking was ranked
ninth amongst the Daolords, and he was famous for his killer
technique, the ‘Stargod clone’. Every single Stargod clone had
50% of the true body’s power! The Starking was able to create a
total of seven such Stargod clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starking’s
‘Astral Dao’ is an extreme one that has obvious flaws, rendering
him weak in close combat. However, it allowed him to develop his
Stargod clone technique, letting him be ranked amongst the top ten in
the Endless Territories.” The red-robed youth smirked. “My own
Astral Dao is more perfect than his. It has no flaws at all. Although
I’m only able to create two Stargod clones, I’m vastly superior
to the Starking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
traded a glance. This unknown Daolord Snowjoy was indeed quite
formidable in close combat. Although he had been defending this
entire time, he was still able to match Ninedust blow for blow. Now
that he had two more Stargod clones with him, what were they to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
red-robed youth and his two Stargod clones simultaneously attacked
the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The furious Ninedust
Sectlord charged forwards as well, his longstaff lashing directly
outwards. His attack looked simple, but it possessed unstoppable
power! The red-robed youth dodged slightly, using his palms to brush
aside the attack, but the Ninedust Sectlord’s longstaff suddenly
twisted and swept outwards to both sides of him, simultaneously
striking at the red-robed youth and the two Stargod clones at the
same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides exchanged
just a few dozen stances before one of the Stargod clones managed to
land a palm-strike directly against the Ninedust Sectlord’s chest,
knocking him flying backwards. The Ninedust Sectlord’s chest had
partially dissolved into a stream of water before quickly reforming.
Although he didn’t have a killer attack like the Stargod clone
technique, his invulnerable aquaform was a far stronger supreme
defensive technique than Snowjoy possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can’t hurt me,
but his true body combined with the two Stargod clones can tie me
down.” The Ninedust Sectlord gritted his teeth, then struck out
with his right hand and produced that strange formation-diagram
within his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! The
formation-diagram in his palm immediately flew out and expanded in
size to cover an area of ten million kilometers. The enormous
formation-diagram was shaped like a square within a circle and filled
with layers of flowing barriers. Thousands of layers of formations
continuously overlapped with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A trap formation?”
The red-robed youth, who had been extremely confident this entire
time, suddenly turned tense. A look of stunned anger appeared on his
face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” The
Ninedust Sectlord immediately pulled Ning with him in a frantic
retreat, the layers of formations parting in front of them. Swoosh!
They entered the black vessel, then quickly fled at maximum speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop running! Stop
running!” Trapped within the enormous formation, the red-robed
youth was able to do nothing besides roar angrily. He had been so
close… so close! The Voidsea Jadeseal had been within reach, but
this trap formation had cut off his chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! BREAK!” The
red-robed youth furiously assaulted the trap formation. He wasn’t
that skilled in the art of formations, and when he saw that this one
was composed of thousands of layers of barriers he knew that
breaching it through raw force was the only chance he had! He had to
continuously consume the power within the formation. Only when its
power was depleted would he have a chance to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… he had no
idea that this was something left behind by a Hegemon of the Ancient
cultivators! This formation was an incredibly strong one. He was
trapped in it for a full hour before managing to escape. By then,
Ning and the Ninedust had fled far, far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The situation looks
pretty bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninedust
Sectlord has a trap formation of incredible power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Snowjoy’s
stuck inside it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Word quickly spread,
and the many Daolords converging on this area began to grow anxious.
It took them time to slowly fly through the ninth layer, making it
difficult for any group to intercept another group. They had been
extremely lucky to have a supreme Daolord manage to intercept Ning’s
squad, but who would’ve thought that the Ninedust Sectlord would be
able to use a trap formation against him and escape with ease?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee, flee, flee!
Ning’s group continued to frantically flee at maximum speed. Both
Ning and Ninedust knew that using a trap formation against such an
opponent was an excellent ploy, but Ninedust’s formation treasure
could only be slowly recharged through the usage of ten million cubes
of chaos jewels! They didn’t really care about money at a time like
this, but it would take two or three days for the recharging process
to be completed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another month went by
in the blink of an eye. Daolord Snowjoy was once more in hot pursuit
of them, but wouldn’t be able to catch up. For now, the group
didn’t encounter a second supreme Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only been a
month. Based on the path in front of us, we’ll still need another
two years before we can escape the ninth layer. I hope things will
progress smoothly.” Ning, Ninedust, and Badlands were all standing
aboard the deck of the black vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
suddenly frowned. He repeatedly engaged in his Numerancy
calculations, only to shake his head again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning and Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Things are becoming
increasingly dangerous!” Badlands explained, “My calculations are
telling me that the situation is going to worsen no matter which way
we go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust snickered,
“They know where we are and are surrounding us from all sides. Of
course things are only going to become increasingly dangerous! Our
only chance is for us to escape the ninth layer. But… if they are
going to try and stop us, they need to prepare to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone’s coming.”
Ning stared towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ninedust
turned to stare forwards as well. A golden streak of light suddenly
appeared off in the distance… and the faces of both Ning and
Ninedust instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth. Long time no see.” A golden-armored, golden-haired man
stood off in the distance, a brilliant smile on his face and violet
light shimmering in his eyes. “You’ve improved quite quickly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Shaka.”
Ning had an ugly look on his face. When Kongsan had failed in his
attempt to kill Ning, Kongsan had asked Daolord Shaka to help out.
Ning had been forced to use his Hegemon Dao-seal to survive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Hegemon’s
Dao-seal was incredibly powerful. It had slaughtered Kongsan
outright! Daolord Shaka, however, had managed to survive and escape
thanks to using a valuable life-preserving treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dare to
bar my path? Aren’t you worried that I might hit you with a second
seal?” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha!” Daolord
Shaka laughed loudly. He naturally had never forgotten the terrifying
scene from a few years back. “Are you really trying to tell me you
had TWO such treasures? And even if you do have a second one, so
what? I knew just how dangerous this trip to the Waveshift Realm
would be and so I paid an incredibly heavy price to procure a
protective treasure. Even if you use a second Dao-seal, I’ll still
be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget him.” The
Ninedust Sectlord frowned, then sent mentally, “Let’s leave.
Don’t waste any time with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
agreed with this idea. Swoosh! The black vessel instantly sped up to
a hundred times the speed of light as the two completely ignored
Daolord Shaka.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” Daolord
Shaka instantly sped up to over a hundred times the speed of light,
waving his hand and sending a streak of golden light straight towards
the black vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” The
Ninedust Sectlord brandished his longstaff, smashing the streak of
golden light aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Daolord
Shaka smiled coldly as he flew closer and closer towards the black
vessel. “You won’t be able to escape.” One golden feather after
another flew out from him, numbering six in total. They all
transformed into streaks of golden light that furiously assaulted the
black vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that Daolord
Shaka.” The Ninedust Sectlord charged out of the black vessel, but
Daolord Shaka was able to easily evade him thanks to his great speed.
Shaka moved faster than a hundred times the speed of light; there was
no way for Ninedust to catch up to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” The Ninedust
Sectlord waved his right hand, causing that formation-diagram to fly
out once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to
slowly flow on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw power,
Daolord Shaka actually wasn’t a match for Ninedust! However, he was
simply too fast. Although he was trapped within the formation for a
full hour, he managed to once more catch up to them in under a day!
He refused to engage Ning and the others in close combat, simply
launching repeated long-distance attacks from afar. This ensured that
they would move very slowly, at less than half of their maximum
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Running and fighting at
the same time… of course they would be much closer! Finally, they
managed to recharge the formation treasure with chaos jewels and once
more trapped Daolord Shaka, but a day later he once more caught up to
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They won’t be able
to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They aren’t going
anywhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Heartforce
Cultivators watching knew exactly what the situation was. Ever since
Daolord Shaka had managed to catch up to Ning’s squad, they had
been dramatically slowed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another five days went
by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Just as
Ning and Ninedust were once more dealing with Daolord Shaka, another
figure suddenly appeared off in the distance and began to fly towards
them. It was the red-robed youth, Daolord Snowjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are finished!”
Daolord Shaka roared with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” Daolord Snowjoy walked towards them, a cold smile on
his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance. They didn’t fear Shaka or Snowjoy despite the
two both being supreme Daolords, but when these two joined forces
they would be able to completely tie down Ning and Ninedust, making
their escape even slower. Most likely, even more Daolords would begin
to arrive! It must be remembered that thus far, not a single one of
the top-ranked Daolords had arrived yet.

Chapter 15 - Sectlord Timedream and the Kingfreak
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Snowjoy slowly
walked towards them through the skies as he made his way towards the
black vessel. As for Daolord Shaka, he attacked from afar using his
magic treasures, using his long-distance attacks to tie down Ji Ning
and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep moving while
fighting. We can’t let ourselves get tied down by them like this,”
the Ninedust Sectlord immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained in
control of the black vessel, watching as Ninedust battled against
Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka by himself. This was a two-on-one
fight, and Ninedust was at a distinct disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust…” Ning
sighed. In truth, there really was no need for Ninedust to involve
himself, as he wouldn’t gain anything from it at all. The Voidsea
Jadeseal wouldn’t be his, regardless of whether they succeeded or
failed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do? I
can’t get involved in a fight at their level. In the end, I’m
still not strong enough.” Ning felt quite resigned as well. Both
Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka were able to ignore the effects of
his heartforce techniques! As for his close combat abilities, Daolord
Snowjoy would be able to overcome and suppress him with just a single
one of his Stargod clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
completely bogged down. Things are going to get worse and worse from
now on.” Ning was truly worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, there were two figures riding a white vessel that was
advancing towards Ning’s position at high speed. The first was an
alien man who wore a crown and who was dressed in beautiful golden
robes. This man had dark-red eyes and emanated the stately aura of a
king. Ordinary Daolords would feel an uncontrollable urge to bow down
and prostrate themselves before him. He was Sectlord Timedream! The
most accomplished Heartforce Cultivator in all the Endless
Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him stood a
short, squat, and ugly man who carried an enormous scimitar on his
back. He was known as the Kingfreak, and was ranked eighteen amongst
the Daolords of the Endless Territories! Although he was ranked
fairly low amongst the supreme first-tier Daolords, he was still one
of them. No supreme Daolords could be underestimated, as they all had
their own specialties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord, we’re
closing in on them. We should be able to catch up in under two days,”
the Kingfreak said in his hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
Sectlord Timedream’s lips crooked upwards slightly. “Daolord
Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy have tied them down, but they won’t be
able to kill Ninedust or Darknorth. As for Winesage and the others,
they are still quite far away. Winesage will have to spend at least
ten days before making it here. Hmph. By then, I would’ve acquired
the Voidsea Jadeseal long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the only one
who deserves it, Sectlord,” the Kingfreak said hoarsely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are three more
seals in the tenth layer.” Sectlord Timedream looked at the
Kingfreak. “As soon as I acquire the second Voidsea Jadeseal, I’m
going to immediately use it! After that, I’ll accompany you into
the tenth layer and fight for one of the remaining three. No matter
what, I guarantee that I’ll help you acquire one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They will all be
yours, Sectlord,” the Kingfreak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. I’ll take any
other treasures, but if we can acquire a second Voidsea Jadeseal it
will go to you,” Sectlord Timedream said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone else who saw
this interaction would be completely shocked. Sectlord Timedream had
founded an enormous sect and was the exalted leader of it, with
countless living beings in his thrall! Those who obeyed him would
live; those who disobeyed him would perish. He was supreme throughout
his world, and was incredibly skilled in manipulating the hearts of
men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the ‘Godking’ of
the Three Realms could be described as delighting in the torment of
others, Sectlord Timedream was even worse. In fact, he had become so
incredibly depraved that he truly could be described as a demon
amongst demons. Despite his extremeness, he had achieved incredible
things in the field of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was neither
good nor bad. The good could reach high levels in it, as could the
bad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Kingfreak?
He was Sectlord Timedream’s right-hand man. The Sectlord couldn’t
be everywhere and do everything, and so many things were left to the
Kingfreak to handle. As for the Kingfreak, he was a mass murderer who
was legendary for his ruthless callousness, a man of unpredictable
temperament! The many disciples of the Timedream Sect were all
terrified whenever they saw him, for fear of offending him and thus
perishing for the offense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two worked
together, they wouldn’t fear even the likes of Palace Lord Dawnstar
or Winesage! One could imagine what an incredibly famous duo they
were in the Endless Territories. Both were fiendish madmen… but
they held genuine and deep affection for each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak was
unswervingly loyal to Sectlord Timedream, and whenever they were out
adventuring he always let the Sectlord have the pick of the treasures
they encountered! Sectlord Timedream was a bit more selfish and often
gave himself the best things first, but in his heart the Kingfreak
truly was second only to himself in importance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!
Darknorth!” A booming voice rang out in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were in a vast,
snowy plains right now. A thick layer of snow had fallen over this
area, and it stretched off as far as the naked eye could see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group had
continued to fight and slowly flee. During the past two days, they
had used the trap formation an additional time, but Daolord Shaka and
Daolord Snowjoy had quickly caught up to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?” Ning
and Ninedust both turned to stare off into the distance, as did
Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two distant figures
were walking towards them side-by-side. The first was a red-eyed man
dressed in beautiful golden robes who emanated an aura of ineffable
majesty. The other was an ugly-looking man who carried an enormous
scimitar on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord Timedream?
The Kingfreak?” Ning and Ninedust both felt their hearts sink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the current top five
Daolords, Winesage and Palace Lord Dawnstar had fairly good
reputations. Daolord Dreamlore had been fairly low-key before this
trip, only becoming famous after defeating the Radiant King. Clearly,
he wasn’t the vile sort either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream,
however, was a truly demonic figure… and the Kingfreak was his most
dangerous of lackeys!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, Timedream and
the Kingfreak have arrived.” Daolord Shaka sent mentally, “Brother
Snowjoy, now that they’ve arrived I expect that Ninedust’s group
won’t be able to hold out against us. However, we need to work
together to acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal. Otherwise, it’ll probably
end up in Timedream’s hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Daolord
Snowjoy turned somber as well. “Let us work together. Once we seize
the seal, we’ll work together to escape, no matter who the seal
ends up with!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Daolord
Shaka nodded. The two immediately swore lifeblood oaths and entered
into an alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Daolord Snowjoy
did acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal, he would need Daolord Shaka’s
speed in order to escape! Right now, fleeing as quickly as possible
once the seal was in hand was what mattered the most. The Radiant
King had been able to escape precisely because of how fast he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Shaka,
he needed Daolord Snowjoy’s strength! Shaka himself was fairly weak
compared to other supreme Daolords, after all. He wouldn’t be able
to resist any of the truly formidable ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two worked
together, they made up for each other’s weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be good boys and
hand over the Voidsea Jadeseal.” Sectlord Timedream slowly walked
over, his voice cold. “My calculations indicate that you should
only be able to use that trap formation once every two or three days.
You won’t be able to activate it again for some time. There’s
nowhere for you to run. Hand it over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha! Four supreme
Daolords. What luck!” The Ninedust Sectlord hefted his longstaff,
roaring with laughter from his position atop the flying vessel.
“Fighting against four supreme Daolords, all by my lonesome… just
thinking about it gets my blood pumping! Come, come! All four you of
you can attack at the same time! I want to see just how tough all of
you are, and I want to see if you can do anything to me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case… let’s attack!” Sectlord Timedream said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Daolord
Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy were the first to charge. Everyone was
entering into close combat, as they were all fairly close to each
other and the first to seize the Voidsea Jadeseal would gain an
enormous advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The
Kingfreak drew his enormous scimitar from his back-sheath and charged
towards the Ninedust Sectlord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on!” The
Ninedust Sectlord awaited them, longstaff at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! As they fought,
ripples of power began to blast out in every direction, annihilating
the snow in the surrounding area and spreading out until they were
blocked by some barriers off in the distance. Ninedust began to fight
Daolord Shaka, Daolord Snowjoy, and the Kingfreak all by himself in a
one-on-three fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Daolord Snowjoy
landed a palm-strike on Ninedust’s chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The Kingfreak
landed a slashing blow with his scimitar on Ninedust’s thigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stab! Daolord Shaka
plunged his longspear into Ninedust’s right arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was sent
stumbling backwards by this barrage of attacks, with the injured
parts of his body dissolving into water and then reforming anew,
completely unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Sectlord
Timedream frowned when he saw this. “This damn Ancient cultivator
really is quite valiant, and he’s mastered an invulnerable
aquaform. Other supreme Daolords on his overall level of power won’t
be able to injure him at all; they won’t even be able to make him
use up much of his divine power! Even Winesage would find it
difficult to kill him, despite possessing a Universe treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This invulnerable
aquaform allowed Ninedust to transform his divine body into an
endless stream of water. You could cut through it, but it would just
continue to flow unabated. There was just no way to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Daolord
Solesky had also mastered a similar aquaform, albeit one based on
fragmentary records. However, his Dao was a bit too extreme in being
defense-oriented. In attack power, he was weaker than even Patriarch
Clearwind! Despite that, his defensive prowess was such that even
Fiendqueen Dustrain had only been able to heavily injure him in her
pursuit of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust’s
invulnerable aquaform was far superior to Solesky’s, allowing him
to ignore the attacks of the Kingfreak, Snowjoy, and Shaka. The
attacks of the three supreme Daolords were having no effect on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea Jadeseal
is in my hands. You can forget about taking it from me!” The
Ninedust Sectlord roared wildly with laughter. “Stop dreaming! You
won’t be able to break my invulnerable aquaform no matter how hard
you try.”

Chapter 16 - The Final Hegemon Dao-Seal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!” The
distant Sectlord Timedream suddenly let out a shout. His voice was
ephemeral and indistinct, reverberating within Ninedust’s ears and
even in his mind and soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Ninedust was shocked as a beautiful gorge appeared in front of him,
filled with a sea of flowers and rivers. However, he had clearly been
in the middle of a vicious fight against three Daolords on a snowy
plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!”
Ninedust roared mentally. Boom! He finally managed to break through
the illusion and force the real world to appear before him once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Ninedust
felt a terrifying level of power crash against him. Caught completely
offguard, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood and be
knocked flying by the strikes. He also felt a chain actually securely
wrap itself around his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!” The
distant Ji Ning was frantic as well. It had all happened too quickly.
Battles between Supreme Daolords occurred at incredible speeds.
Although Ninedust had been trapped within the illusion for merely a
brief instant, it had been enough for him to suffer two strikes and
also be caught and bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak was
holding the other end of the chain that was now securely fastened
around the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Ninedust
Sectlord’s divine body suddenly transformed into an endless stream
of water that flowed through and past the chains, then reformed
outside of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an impressive
Timedream.” The Ninedust Sectlord’s face was ashen as he stared
hard at Sectlord Timedream. “He really is the strongest Daolord in
the art of illusions in the modern era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I’m
still not strong enough. If I was, you wouldn’t have been able to
break free from my illusions,” Sectlord Timedream said calmly. He
was still not satisfied with his performance. In this day and age, he
was the strongest pure Heartforce Cultivator; Winesage was stronger
than him overall, but was inferior in heartforce alone. However, this
was merely in ‘this day and age’; from a historical standpoint,
there had been many other Heartforce Cultivator Daolords who were far
superior to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The truly supreme
Heartforce Cultivator Daolords would almost always be the undisputed
most powerful Daolords of their eras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, are you
alright?” Ning sent worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine. Twas but
a minor injury! I’m an Ancient cultivator; my divine body is far
superior to that of ordinary cultivators,” Ninedust sent mentally
to Ning. In substance and in power, his body was indeed unfathomably
superior to that of ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Press the attack and
make him suffer more injuries!” the distant Sectlord Timedream sent
mentally to Shaka, Snowjoy, and Kingfreak. “Ninedust’s
invulnerable aquaform is difficult to deal with; not even Winesage
would be able to kill him through direct attacks. I’ll continuously
use heartforce illusions against him and make it impossible for him
to maintain his aquaform, while the three of you will repeatedly
injure him over and over. When his divine power is depleted, he’ll
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shaka and Snowjoy
exchanged a glance. Both of them knew that killing a supreme Daolord
was far too difficult, especially one with an invulnerable aquaform!
They would indeed need Sectlord Timedream to repeatedly disturb
Ninedust and cause him to lose control over his body for brief
periods of time. When that happened, his body would briefly transform
into its original form, that of an Ancient cultivator’s. Only then
would they be able to harm Ninedust. If Ninedust was fully awake and
mentally alert, he could perpetually maintain his invulnerable
aquaform. In that case, there would be no way to injure him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
continued to cast heartforce illusions from afar, while Shaka,
Snowjoy, and Kingfreak pressed the assault furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!” Ning
frantically unleashed his own heartforce, seeking to protect
Ninedust. Bang! Sectlord Timedream’s overwhelming surge of
heartforce completely crushed through Ning’s protection. At his
current level, Ning was completely unable to protect the Ninedust
Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine,
Darknorth! I’m fine. Thus far, I’ve used up very little divine
power,” the Ninedust Sectlord sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on, one second after another. The four enemy Daolords completely
ignored Ning. As they saw it, Ninedust was their true foe, and they
also felt certain that the Voidsea Jadeseal was in Ninedust’s
hands! They could see that Ninedust was the most powerful member of
Ning’s squad, which meant that the seal should logically be in his
hands. If it was in someone else’s hands, why would he go so far as
to risk his own life to protect the team?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
another half-day had gone by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! Man, the
three of you really are starting to sting me with your hits.” The
Ninedust Sectlord transformed into an vast stream of water, with the
vague outline of a person appearing at the center of this river.
Moments later, a spirit-pill appeared in the figure’s hand,
followed by the figure swallowing it. “I really did use up quite a
bit of divine power over the course of this fight. Time to eat a
spirit-pill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust’s divine
body is far too powerful, and he also has a tough protective divine
ability. We’ve been beating on him for hours but have barely harmed
him. He was able to recover with just a single pill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’ll be no end
to this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka, Daolord
Snowjoy, and the Kingfreak were all growing anxious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, let’s
keep fighting. I have to say, Timedream’s heartforce illusions are
pretty powerful. They’re serving as a great way to temper my
Dao-heart.” The Ninedust Sectlord was in an excellent mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, the longer
we keep you tied down, the more Daolords will come. Soon, a fifth
supreme Daolord will arrive, followed by a sixth! In the end, you
won’t be able to handle us all,” Sectlord Timedream said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, I’ll just toss out the Voidsea Jadeseal,” Ninedust
snickered. “Timedream, multiple Ancient cultivators have died by
your hands. Do you really think I would ever give the Voidsea
Jadeseal up to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.”
Sectlord Timedream had an ugly look on his face. It must be
remembered that Winesage and the others were hurrying over as well.
Once Winesage arrived, who would be able to out-compete him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freako.” Sectlord
Timedream sent mentally to the Kingfreak, “Use the redscatter venom
on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak couldn’t
help but turn to look at the Sectlord Timedream. He sent back
mentally, “Sectlord, we only have that one bottle. Are you sure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use it.” Sectlord
Timedream nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redscatter venom
was the most terrifying type of poison the two had ever discovered,
and they had found it while adventuring within the Terror Starsea.
This was a deadly poison which had been developed during the Dawn
War, and it was the greatest killer trump card Sectlord Timedream had
available to him. This type of poison was a nightmare to any and
every Daolord! Ever since Sectlord Timedream had acquired it, he
hadn’t been willing to use it… but for the sake of the Voidsea
Jadeseal, anything was worth it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The Ninedust
Sectlord was once more struck by the heartforce illusion. The endless
flows of water around him instantly halted, then gradually began to
reform into his ‘normal’ body, which Shaka, Snowjoy, and
Kingfreak continued to attack. Right as the Kingfreak launched an
attack, he suddenly produced a bottle of dark-red liquid and
shattered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A stream of
dark-red liquid instantly invaded the Ninedust Sectlord’s body.
This stream of liquid was visible to the naked eye, but it also
seemed illusory. It seeped directly into his body and pervaded his
soul. This was a terrifying type of poison which had been developed
during the Dawn War to deal with enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHH!” The
Ninedust Sectlord transformed back into human form, then began to
roll around the ground and scream in agony. His face was a mask of
pain, with streaks of ugly red lines stretching out throughout his
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHHHHH!”
Ninedust continued to howl in agony. He had never experienced such
incredible, indescribable, terrifying pain before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!” Ning
felt as though his heart had stopped. He couldn’t even begin to
imagine what sort of pain and torment could cause a supreme Daolord
like Ninedust to scream so miserably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release Ninedust!
Release him!” Ning charged out and called out frantically, “We’ll
give you the Voidsea Jadeseal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no antidote
to the redscatter venom. Once it touches you, you’ll suffer utter
agony for a total of twelve days. This poison was meant for to be
used against powerful Eternal Emperors! There’s no way Ninedust’s
Dao-heart or soul would be strong enough to resist it. He isn’t
even able to maintain his invulnerable aquaform any longer. Kill him,
then take the Voidsea Jadeseal from him,” Sectlord Timedream
laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Daolord
Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy both turned pale. Redscatter venom? They
had never even heard of it, but they couldn’t help but shiver in
fear when they saw Daolord Ninedust scream in pain like that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust’s screams
were echoing in Ning’s ears, but there was no way for him to rescue
Ninedust at all. This caused Ning to feel a sense of regret and
powerlessness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ninedust continued
to scream in agony, he would occasionally turn to glance towards
Ning. His eyes were filled with agony and desperation, and his lips
trembled as he struggled to speak. “Kill me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
Kingfreak charged towards Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.” Shaka
and Snowjoy exchanged a glance. This wasn’t a time to show mercy.
They had to seize the Voidsea Jadeseal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was too weak.
There was no way he could stop them at all. He hurriedly sent
mentally, “Big brother Solesky! Big brother Solesky! Let’s hand
over the Voidsea Jadeseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was in
secluded meditation within Ning’s estate-world, not accepting any
communication from the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
frantic. Solesky had actually gone into secluded meditation at a time
like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!!” Ning drew
his six Northbow swords and charged forwards, grabbing the Ninedust
Sectlord. Ninedust continued to scream in agony, his eyes filled with
pleading as he stared at Ning. He really did want for Ning to kill
him and spare him any more of this. With but a thought, Ning pulled
Ninedust away into his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ninedust was
completely defenseless and unable to fight back at all. He would
probably die in short order if he stayed out here, and so Ning had no
choice but to drag him away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you looking to
die, kid?” The Kingfreak brandished the great scimitar in his
hands. BOOM! Ning was smashed flying backwards, while the Kingfreak
staggered one step back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” As Ning was
knocked flying backwards, he produced a deep blue crystalline leaf in
his right hand. This was the second and final Dao-seal the Sword
Hegemon had bestowed upon him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack. He shattered the
deep blue leaf.

Chapter 17 - The Dao-Seal’s Power
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deep blue crystal
leaf shattered, and a flood of terrifying power that had been hidden
inside it was completely unleashed! Although it held only a fraction
of a full-force strike from the Sword Hegemon, the power of this blow
still vastly surpassed a full-power blow from one of the eight lords
of the Sacred Cities. There was no way even the most supreme of
Daolords would be able to resist this level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhhhhhhhhh!”
Ninedust was now within Ji Ning’s estate-world, and he continued to
scream in pain. His face remained a rictus of agony as those dark red
lines continued to spread throughout his body. Clearly, the
terrifying pain he was in hadn’t lessened in the slightest after
entering this estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust!” Ning
felt both regret and fury in his heart. “All of you can go die!!!”
Ning was filled with a murderous intent as he activated that flood of
incredible power. Instantly, an enormous, horrifying illusion of a
greatsword appeared in the area around Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusory greatsword
lay horizontal, causing spacetime to freeze and severing karma
itself. Its incredible, terrifying presence caused the Kingfreak,
Daolord Shaka, Daolord Snowjoy, and even Sectlord Timedream to turn
pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?! He used up one of those things when he killed Kongsan. How
does he have another one?!” This was the second time Daolord Shaka
had ever encountered this terrifying illusory greatsword. Gritting
his teeth, he immediately produced the most powerful protective
treasure he had purchased prior to entering the Waveshift Realm,
causing a palm-sized black seed to appear in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Snowjoy,
don’t move!” Daolord Shaka sent mentally. Crack! The black seed
shattered into tiny pieces of dust as the power within it was
released. Vine-like tendrils furiously sprouted out the shattered
black seed, spreading out in every direction and quickly covering
both Shaka and Snowjoy from head to toe, forming a vine cube that was
roughly thirty meters in diameter! Shaka and Snowjoy were completely
covered and protected by this rattan vine cube.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust has been
poisoned by our redscatter venom and is no longer a threat. After we
kill him, the Voidsea Jadeseal will be ours.” Sectlord Timedream
had begun to move closer towards Ninedust’s direction as well as
Shaka, Snowjoy, and Kingfreak had charged forward. All of them knew
that the Voidsea Jadeseal was about to fall into someone’s hands;
if he moved closer, his chances would be much greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Darknorth
actually pulled Ninedust into his estate-world?” Sectlord Timedream
smirked. “He’s courting death. We were completely focused on
Ninedust earlier and couldn’t be bothered with him. We should be
able to wipe him out in a few seconds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ninedust was
suffering indescribable torment, the fact that he was able to mouth
out the words ‘kill me’ showed that he was able to maintain a
modicum of consciousness. Ning was on his side, and so he wouldn’t
resist being drawn away into Ning’s estate-world. The others,
however, wouldn’t have that chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.”
Sectlord Timedream followed the Kingfreak, Shaka, and Snowjoy in
charging straight towards Ning. Much like how Solewind was decent in
close combat, Sectlord Timedream was a first-tier Daolord in close
combat as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heavens turned
dark. The world went silent. Time and space froze. Karma itself was
severed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An overwhelming,
awe-inspiring aura of power manifested as a giant illusory greatsword
appeared out of thin air. Sectlord Timedream was shocked, his earlier
confidence gone. Both he and Kingfreak were vile men who had wandered
the Endless Territories for many years. As a result, they had battled
against a number of mighty major powers in the past, and had
encountered a number of terrifying Dao-seals. However, the illusory
greatsword in front of him gave him a sense of terror that was
greater than anything he had ever felt before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Hegemon’s
field of expertise lay in annihilatory attacks, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FREAK!!!” Sectlord
Timedream screamed mentally as he reached out, producing a dazzlingly
beautiful snow flower in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord.” The
terrified Kingfreak was frantically retreating as well, seeking to
reunite with Sectlord Timedream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The snow flower
bloomed, expanding to cover the surrounding area and protecting both
Sectlord Timedream and the Kingfreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
most valuable would be kept in Sectlord Timedream’s hands! Only if
they found a second copy would the treasure go to the Kingfreak.
Treasures like the redscatter venom that had to be used in close
combat, Timedream would let the Kingfreak hold on to, as the
Kingfreak was responsible for charging into the fray as the vanguard.
This flower, however, was a protective treasure that would cause a
formation to appear once activated. The formation could be used to
trap foes, but it could also be used to resist outside attacks. This
was the most powerful tool Sectlord Timedream at his disposal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beautiful flower
wrapped itself around the Kingfreak and Sectlord Timedream,
protecting them in multiple layers of formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single one of the
four supreme Daolords were able to escape from Ning’s illusory
greatsword. They had instead chosen to produce the most powerful
protective treasures they had to resist it. Escape on their own? All
of them knew this was impossible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning stared
intently at Sectlord Timedream and the Kingfreak, as well as that
enormous flower around them. He wanted to kill the two of them most
of all, because they were the ones who had poisoned Ninedust!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The illusory
greatsword chopped directly against that enormous flower. The flower
instantly began to tremble as it swiveled, its layers of petals
furiously shifting aside the force of the attack. As the petals
continued to spin, waves of terrifying might began to blast outwards
in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
nearby Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka were protected within their
vine globe, and the waves of power smashed against them as well. The
vines, however, were incredibly tough and managed to resist the
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely
terrifying. We’re facing just a tiny amount of its full power
that’s been diverted in our direction. How can it still be this
strong?” Protected by the vine globe, Snowjoy and Shaka had ashen
looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
Sectlord Timedream’s face turned ashen as well from his position
within the flower formation. He was in command of the formation and
thus could clearly sense what was happening to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flower formation
possessed incredible powers of endurance, and it operated on the
principles of shunting aside power and enduring the rest, with more
than 90% of any attack being diverted away. And yet, the chopping
attack of this illusory greatsword was clearly still unleashing more
power than the flower formation could endure. Its petals were already
beginning to rip and tear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about to
crumble.” Finally, one petal completely crumbled apart. A second
then crumbled, followed by a third… and as it did, the amount of
power that was being shunted to the nearby vine globe began to
gradually lessen as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak and
Sectlrod Timedream almost simultaneously produced a pair of unique
protective treasures to protect themselves. Although this formation
was the only Hegemon-level treasure they had, they did have several
treasures that were comparable in might to the eight lords of the
Sacred Cities. As for the weaker treasures, those were merely on par
with the Kingfreak and Sectlord Timedream themselves and thus were of
no use to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… whoosh…
whoosh… Finally, the flower formation completely burst apart and
shattered apart into small pieces. The remaining power of the
illusory greatsword chopped straight towards the Kingfreak and
Sectlord Timedream!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
The barriers erected around them immediately began to break apart as
the two of them were both knocked backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! Sectlord
Timedream slammed into the snowy ground, kicking up a wave of snow
around him. He spat out a mouthful of blood, but a look of wild joy
was on his face. “Survived. I survived!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survived. We both
survived.” The Kingfreak was filled with joy as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only those who had
faced that strike personally would understand how terrifying it had
been. The illusory greatsword of the Sword Hegemon was a frontal,
head-on, crushing attack! Even the remaining fragments of its energy
had been enough to terrorize and terrify the Kingfreak and the
Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It first destroyed a
Hegemon-level formation, then destroyed four other protective
treasures… and it still had enough power to injure the two of us!
What a terrifying treasure.” Sectlord Timedream glared at the
distant Ning, his eyes filled with murder. “He destroyed quite a
few of our treasures. Kill him, Freak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will.” The
Kingfreak was enraged as well. How could he not be? The puny Daolord
Darknorth had brought him to the brink of death! He immediately
unsheathed his great scimitar and charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
watched from afar, not following this time. In truth, he really had
been badly frightened by Ning’s usage of that Hegemon Dao-seal. “He
probably doesn’t have a second one… right?” For a person to
have a single copy of such a treasure was already incredible. Two?
Two would be inconceivable. Three? What, was it as common as dirt?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, given Ning’s
level of power it would’ve been extremely difficult for him to
acquire such treasures through adventuring. The Sword Hegemon had
only chosen to give him two due to taking him on as an honorary
disciple! This was because the Sword Hegemon had known that his death
was impending and unavoidable, which was why he was willing to spend
an enormous price to create these Dao-seals. In normal situations,
not even figures like the Brightshore Hegemon would be willing to
gift Dao-seals of such terrifying power to mere honorary disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more power a
Dao-seal packed, the harder it would be to craft. In ordinary combat,
the Sword Hegemon would’ve been able to unleash ten or twenty
full-strength blows with ease, but to compact and compress all of
that power into a Dao-seal was incredibly difficult. If he merely put
in a small portion of his full power, perhaps the same level of power
as the eight lords of the Sacred Cities possessed, things would be
much easier… but infusing a full-force blow into a Dao-seal truly
required an enormous amount of effort and expense!

Chapter 18 - Omega Sword Dao - Level Three
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning only had a
total of two Dao-seals from the Sword Hegemon. The first had been
used up against Kongsan and Shaka, while he had used up the second
one here in the Waveshift Realm. He really was out of treasures on
this level now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Hidden
within his vine treasure, Daolord Shaka felt a sense of pain in his
heart. He had paid an extremely high price for this seed, precisely
because he had felt himself to be in life-threatening danger during
his last encounter with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
actually focused all of his power against Timedream and Kingfreak,
and I just suffered a few collateral shockwaves? That means I just
completely wasted this seed for nothing.” Daolord Shaka felt
endless regret. This vine globe’s protective powers were immense,
but it was a single-use item. Now, it had been used up without
actually making much of a difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait a while
longer. Darknorth might have a third seal!” Daolord Shaka mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Shaka, why
aren’t we going out yet?” The nearby Daolord Snowjoy said
anxiously. “The Kingfreak is already attacking. Once he kills
Daolord Darknorth, the Voidsea Jadeseal will end up in his hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be anxious.
Let’s watch for a while longer,” Daolord Shaka said immediately.
“Darknorth might have another one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another one? Could
he really have another such treasure?” Daolord Snowjoy didn’t
believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, I’m
much faster than Timedream and Kingfreak. I’ll definitely intervene
at the critical moment,” Daolord Shaka said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka and
Daolord Snowjoy continued to watch from behind the protective vine
globe as the Kingfreak charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, kid.” The
Kingfreak’s eyes were filled with fury and murder. “I won’t
give you any chance this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, Kingfreak.
You’ll be the one to die.” Ning manifested three heads and six
arms, wielding all six of his Northbow swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The Kingfreak’s
enormous scimitar glittered with cold light as it chopped straight
towards Ning. Although Ning was skilled in defense, the disparity in
power was too great and he was still sent flying backwards! The
Kingfreak quickly charged forwards once again in pursuit of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
two battled fiercely, with Ning just barely able to defend. Thanks to
his defensive sword-arts and his Hegemon armor, he was able to just
barely hold on, even though he was fighting against a higher-tier
Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He doesn’t have
any more Dao-seals with that level of power.” The distant Sectlord
Timedream revealed a delighted look as he charged forwards as well.
“Freak, this kid is taking you pretty long. Let me help you out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s weaker than
me, but he has a very powerful protective divine ability,” the
Kingfreak sent mentally. “Sectlord, if we work together we’ll be
able to defeat and capture him with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka and
Daolord Snowjoy charged out of the vine globe they had been watching
from as well. Based on how badly Ning was being beaten, they felt
certain that Ning didn’t have any more terrifying Dao-seals left.
They naturally chose to immediately come out and fight over the
Voidsea Jadeseal as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in dire
straits! The Kingfreak, Sectlord Timedream, Daolord Shaka, and
Daolord Snowjoy were all attacking him. They wanted to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHHHHH!!!!” Ning
suddenly let out an enraged howl as his aura expanded dramatically!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust had been
helping out strictly out of a sense of loyalty to Ning, but he was
now suffering unspeakable torment and was in such pain that he begged
for death. When Ninedust silently mouthed the words ‘kill me’
towards Ning, Ning felt as though his heart was being stabbed by
knives. He was filled with pain, regret, and guilt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to hand over
the Voidsea Jadeseal to end this battle, only to discover that his
big brother Solesky had gone into secluded meditation. He truly had
been driven to his wits end!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he used the Sword
Hegemon’s Dao-seal…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When that
overwhelmingly awesome phantom of a giant greatsword had appeared and
emanated that terrifying aura of sword-intent, Ning’s soul had
suddenly trembled. The bottleneck that had trapped him for so many
years had suddenly loosened, with many new insights slowly beginning
to enter his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many years ago, when he
had used the Stone Censer of Reunion in the Thundersouth Palace, he
had managed to reach the third stage in all five of his sword-intents
- the Blood Drop sword-intent, the Shadowless sword-intent, the
Soleheart sword-intent, the Heavenbreaker sword-intent, and the
Yin-Yang sword-intent. However, he had been unable to fuse them
together into the third-level Omega Sword Dao. Right at this moment,
however, his mind, heart, and truesoul were all in a completely
berserk, frenzied state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the illusory
greatsword manifested, these many emotions mixed together with the
insights he gained from that terrifying sword-intent. And so…
although the Hegemon’s Dao-seal hadn’t slain anyone, when the
Kingfreak attacked Ning, Ning didn’t move to flee despite having no
more seals available to him. Instead, he ‘foolishly’ chose to
engage the Kingfreak in close combat… and as he fought, a new surge
of sword-intent slowly took form in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword-intent
was completely and fully formed, the third stage of his Omega Sword
Dao finally took shape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rage, regret, and
guilt Ning had suppressed inside his heart fully exploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHHHHHHH!!!!”
Ning reared his head to let out a frenzied roar, his primal cry
echoing in heaven and earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to die!”
Ning turned his gaze towards the attacking Kingfreak, Sectlord
Timedream, Daolord Shaka, and Daolord Snowjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! One energy dragon after another flew out of Ning’s body
as his nine novessence arts burst forth, transforming into an utterly
terrifying Yin-Yang Chaosworld. His Omega Sword Dao - Yin Yang was
already on par with the formations which Daolord Allgod had used at
his peak, and when used via his Omega Sword Dao they exploded with
terrifying levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream’s
heartworld projection was actually forcibly held at bay!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Expand, my
heartworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grow, my Dao-tree!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evolve, my divine
body!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t hesitate
at all, pouring all of his chaos spirit-pills into his body. Chaos
spirit-pills were pills that could be used in combat to quickly
replenish divine power and Immortal energy. Chaos jewels were far
slower in comparison. While chaos nectar was fairly fast, it was
quite marvelous and using it in such a way was far too wasteful. For
example, if you wished to merely replenish your divine power, a
thousand cubes of chaos jewels would have the same effect as roughly
a hundred million cubes of chaos nectar! This difference was a
shocking one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten spirit-pills that
were worth roughly ten thousand cubes of chaos nectar would be enough
to achieve the same effect. Although this was more ‘expensive’
than using chaos jewels, they didn’t bring any burden to the divine
body, which could rapidly and fully absorb all of their energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
using the high level spirit-pill known as the chaos spirit-pill, with
every single pill being worth ten thousand cubes of chaos nectar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course,
replenishing divine power was different from fueling the body with
the energy it needed to evolve. The amount of energy Ning needed
right now was staggeringly vast, which was why most Daolords would
prefer to absorb chaos energy from the outside world instead. If they
wanted to be a bit extravagant, they might use chaos jewels! Using
spirit-pills would be an even more extravagant method. As for using
chaos nectar? That was virtually impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The
towering Dao-tree within his body began to grow. It had originally
been 252,000 meters tall, and it now began to grow taller and
thicker. Even its branches began to thicken as the entire Dao-tree
expanded in size, stopping only when it reached a height of 297,000
meters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">297,000 meters was the
absolute limit for Daolords of the Third Step. But of course,
although Ning was ‘merely’ a Daolord of the Third Step, his path
was that of the Omega Sword Dao. As a result, his Dao-tree was
unfathomably thicker than that of other Daolords, which meant that
his roots were far deeper and more stable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His heartworld
began to furiously expand. A hundred chaos spirit-pills instantly
appeared in the center of the heartworld, and the heartworld began to
ravenously devour their power and expand at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had broken
through to become a Daolord of the Second Step, he had relied on
chaos jewels and had succeeded after just a few brief moments. This
time, he was using the energy of the chaos spirit-pills to make his
breakthrough. Thus, his divine body was completely transformed in
almost the blink of an eye! Every single cell in his body was
evolving simultaneously as there was enough energy to support this,
making the process incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine power and
his Immortal energy broke through at the same time as well. His
heartworld absorbed the most energy; Ning had prepared a hundred
chaos spirit-pills for it, and it took a fairly long period of time
to absorb the energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azureflower mist
energy began to slowly transform, but it too would take some time. He
had a total of 1111 drops of the azureflower mist energy, after all,
and every single drop was condensed from all of his divine power and
Immortal energy combined. If he was to use chaos spirit-pills to
completely replenish his azureflower mist energy… even Ning
wouldn’t be able to afford that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Ning at the
center, nine energy dragons flew out to form the Yin-Yang Chaosworld.
This smashed straight into Timedream’s heartworld projection and
came crashing towards all four Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time,
streaks of sword-light began to appear in the skies. Some of the
streaks looked like towering, dominating mountains. Some looked
incredibly, terrifyingly sharp. Still others looked inscrutable and
unpredictable, moving about at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of streaks of
sword-light appeared. This was the manifestation of Ning’s
third-stage Omega Sword Dao! The stronger a Dao, the more powerful an
aura it would manifest. The power of the aura of Ning’s Dao alone
was already on par with roughly 20% - 30% of his true close combat
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
tightly clustered streaks of sword light flew straight into the
Yin-Yang Chaosworld, then attacked the four Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning’s aura
began to stabilize as it ascended to a higher level. Just a few
heartbeats later, his divine power and his Immortal energy had both
completed their breakthroughs. Ning’s body blurred as he once more
manifested [Three Heads, Six Arms]. Six Northbow swords at the ready,
he glared at his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning rode
the countless streaks of sword-light and commanded his Yin-Yang
Chaosworld in a direct attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak,
Timedream, Shaka, and Snowjoy were all supreme Daolords. None of them
had viewed Ning as an opponent, and they had only thought to kill him
as soon as possible so as to take the Voidsea Jadeseal. They were all
wary of each other, as they viewed each other as competitors. As for
Ning? He was nothing more than a dead man to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… the aura
Ning had just exploded with, along with the terrifying power of his
Yin-Yang Chaosworld, was a sign that this Daolord Darknorth had just
reached a shocking level of might.

Chapter 19 - Crushed
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The Yin-Yang
Chaosworld came crashing down, swallowing the Kingfreak and Daolord
Shaka within it. These two had charged to the very front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
secret art.” The Kingfreak and Daolord Shaka both could feel the
weighty pressure surrounding them, causing them both to drastically
slow down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream, hurry up
and push this secret art aside!” Daolord Shaka barked mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heartworld
projection cannot stop it!” Sectlord Timedream was furiously trying
to batter the secret art aside, but the nine novessence arts
continuously smashed his heartworld projection aside. Although the
difference between the nine novessence arts and his heartworld
projection wasn’t that great, Timedream’s heartworld projection
was still defeated time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to do
this instead.” Sectlord Timedream willed it, and his heartworld
projection instantly changed to become illusory and overlap with the
nine novessence arts rather than fight them head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartworld projections
were a unique form of energy that were completely different from the
energy which secret arts used! They were completely capable of
perfectly overlapping with secret arts and causing their power to
increase, but they could also be used to cause trouble from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie it down.”
Sectlord Timedream’s eyes flashed with cold light. As the energies
completely overlapped, the heartworld projection began to furiously
wrap its energies around the nine novessence arts, causing them to be
weakened so dramatically as to be negligible against supreme
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ji Ning could
sense each of his nine novessence arts be dramatically weakened and
constricted, causing their power to plummet. “The heartworld
projection? Hmph. Once my heartworld fully expands to its maximum
size, I’ll crush you head-on.” Ning was filled with murderous
rage right now, and he attacked the Kingfreak with his six Northbow
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Close combat was his
true forte! Secret arts were merely meant to assist and reinforce
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Even if you’ve
broken through to become a supreme Daolord, you are merely on par
with us. How dare you act so arrogantly? You want to fight the four
of us head-on? Even the Radiant King or Palace Lord Dawnstar would
choose to retreat in the face of us four.” The Kingfreak smirked.
He could tell that Daolord Darknorth seemed to have made some sort of
breakthrough, but the four of them were supreme Daolords; why would
they fear him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The
Kingfreak gripped his scimitar tightly in both hands, then sent it
howling through the air with a baleful aura surrounding it. The giant
scimitar left a crescent streak of light in the skies as it chopped
down furiously towards Ning. If it wasn’t for the Waveshift Realm
itself suppressing spacetime effects, his attack would’ve been far
more terrifying thanks to certain spacetime elements it normally
contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning’s six
arms suddenly moved to grip a single Northbow sword. He lifted it
high into the air, then delivered a furious chop of his own, one
which caused even spacetime to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword seemed
to contain the ponderance and weight of an ancient god-mountain, and
it struck head-on against the Kingfreak’s enormous scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak felt a
surge of terrifying power crash towards him. He couldn’t help but
be smashed downwards by this incredible power and be sent hurtling
towards the snowy ground beneath him. He crashed into the ground,
leaving behind an enormous crater as he landed in a kneeling
position. The only reason he didn’t fall down was because he used
his hands to prop himself up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
powerful?” The Kingfreak was shocked. He sent mentally to Sectlord
Timedream, “Be careful, Sectlord. This Daolord Darknorth’s
attacks are incredibly ferocious; my feeling is that he is on par
with Daolord Skyaxe in raw strength. I’m at a complete disadvantage
in a head-on clash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Skyaxe used a
single greataxe and was legendary for his ferocious, overbearing
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” After
delivering that furious chop, Ning immediately charged downwards,
wanting to pursue the Kingfreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you seem to have become quite strong.” Daolord Shaka and Daolord
Snowjoy hurriedly intervened, while Sectlord Timedream actually
retreated slightly, becoming the most distant of the four Daolords.
In truth, Daolord Shaka didn’t really care that much about this; if
he was able to seize the Voidsea Jadeseal, they’d immediately be
able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Daolord Shaka
produced a series of golden feathers in front of him. All six of them
transformed into streaks of golden light that shot towards Ning. At
the same time, he manifested a total of six awl-wielding arms and
charged straight at Ning himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the fastest of
the four Daolords, faster than even Daolord Snowjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
didn’t carea bout Daolord Shaka at all. He manifested [Three Heads,
Six Arms] and spun his six Northbow swords slightly, executing the
Soleheart sword-intent with all six swords. An enormous black hole
immediately appeared before him, devouring and destroying all in its
path. When the six golden feathers touched the black hole, they were
immediately knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Daolord
Shaka shot towards him, golden awls at the ready, moving faster than
a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, six
dazzling streaks of sword-light lit up. Every single streak of
sword-light looked quite ordinary, but just as they reached Daolord
Shaka the tips of the swords began to rotate slightly. Instantly…
boom! They tore through all obstacles, moving much faster as well.
They actually surpassed a hundred times the speed of light, and their
power vastly exceeded Daolord Shaka’s as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming a
Daolord of the Third Step, Ning’s Blood Drop stance, especially
when executed via the highly suited Northbow swords, had reached an
incredible level of power. Now, not even time could stand in front of
this strike. Ning’s sword-arts had now transcended both space and
time! They were on par with the most powerful strike Emperor
Mirrorsnow had ever devised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Waveshift
Realm suppressed all techniques that transcended spacetime. Still,
the Blood Drop stance destroyed all Daos before it, and thus it was
still able to forcibly breach the normal Daolord limit of moving a
hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When actually flying
via the Blood Drop evasion art, however, Ning was only able to move
at a hundred times the speed of light. In the end, his own body
wasn’t nearly as formidable as his Northbow swords. The main reason
he was able to strike faster than a hundred times the speed of light
was primarily because of the Northbow swords themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!” Daolord
Shaka let out an agonized cry, staring in disbelief as three of the
swords stabbed into his body. He then looked at Ning, his eyes filled
with disbelief. “How can he be this fast?” He had absolute
confidence in his speed, but he was defeated in speed. Daolord Shaka
simply couldn’t understand or accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…
whoosh! Daolord Shaka transformed into countless light shadows that
reformed far off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He actually
beat both Kingfreak and Shaka in succession?” The distant Sectlord
Timedream turned pale. “And he only needed one blow in each case?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, it seems
you can now rank in the top five. Haha, very well then! I’ve come
to the Waveshift Realm because I wanted to fight the strongest in the
universe.” Daolord Snowjoy actually charged forwards, and as he did
so the starlight emanating from his body began to manifest into a
pair of Stargod clones. All three of them surrounded and
simultaneously attacked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off.” Ning’s
sword-light flared mightily. The battle between the two was
absolutely shocking, with Ning clearly holding the upper hand but
Daolord Snowjoy and his two Stargod clones managing to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an actual battle,
even Ninedust had been put on the defense by Daolord Snowjoy! Daolord
Snowjoy’s defenses could be described as flawless. Even the Radiant
King or Palace Lord Dawnstar wouldn’t necessarily be able to shake
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the four of us,
Daolord Snowjoy is indeed the strongest in close combat.” The
Kingfreak, Shaka, and Timedream all admitted to this fact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld,
descend!” Ning let out a furious roar. Boom! An incredibly vast
heartworld projection suddenly came crashing down from the skies.
This world had mountains, rivers, grasslands, deserts, vast oceans,
and an incredibly vast sword-shaped mountain at the very center of
the world. Its aura and might was now clearly far greater than in the
past, and when it came crashing down it merged into a seamless whole
with Ning’s nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Sectlord
Timedream’s heartworld projection instantly crumbled, resulting in
Daolord Snowjoy, Shaka, Kingfreak, and Timedream all being put under
an immense amount of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s nine
novessence arts and heartworld projection were both terrifying,
resulting in Daolord Snowjoy and the others being unable to exert
more than 50% of their true power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could his
heartworld projection be this strong? Break! Break!” Sectlord
Timedream repeatedly tried to cause his heartworld projection to
descend, send it crashing against Ning’s projection repeatedly.
This really did help relieve the pressure on the three of them!
Timedream’s heartworld projection was on par with Ning’s after
all; while Ning’s projection was slightly larger, there wasn’t
that much of a difference in terms of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Although the
pressure had been somewhat relieved, Daolord Snowjoy was still only
able to unleash roughly 70% of his true power. In just a few short
clashes, he was smote by Ning’s Heavenbreaker stance six times in a
row and was sent flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When faced with a
flawless defense, the best way to deal with it was to burst through
it with raw power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” After
knocking Daolord Snowjoy aside, Ning immediately turned to charge
towards the Kingfreak. The Kingfreak was the weakest of the four, and
Ning wanted to kill him more than any of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s fighting us
one-on-four and holds the upper hand?” Shaka, Snowjoy, Timedream,
and Kingfreak were all rather stunned. They all felt a sense of a
pressure, especially after Ning combined his nine novessence arts
with his heartworld projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
he’s going to break us down one by one. We need to work together to
attack him jointly,” Sectlord Timedream sent mentally. “If the
four of us join forces, even Winesage wouldn’t have been able to
withstand us prior to finding that Universe treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Daolord
Shaka agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Although
Daolord Snowjoy was a very proud figure, he agreed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… a strange
ripple of power shot out of Ning’s body and invaded the Kingfreak’s
body. This was the [Dreamstar] art! The [Dreamstar] art had reached a
brand new level of power, as it was unleashed via the heartforce
nurtured within Ning’s heartworld. The Kingfreak had been holding
his scimitar in a double-handed grip, seeking to defend against
Ning’s attack, but his movements now clearly slowed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning was in
three-headed, six-armed form, and he sent his six Northbow swords in
a series of furious strikes against the Kingfreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Ning launched a total of nine attacks in the blink of an
eye, every single attack using the Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker.
This was Ning’s most savage and dominating attack! Although the
Kingfreak did have a suit of Eternal armor protecting him, the power
of Ning’s attacks continued to hammer down upon him without him
being able to defend at all. By Ning’s fifth strike, his divine
body had already completely disintegrated, and Ning didn’t stop
until his ninth strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak’s
corpse really had been reduced to dust, with only his armor and his
scimitar left behind. A supreme Daolord, the ‘Kingfreak’… had
just perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Sectlord
Timedream’s eyes bulged out, and he let out an agonized,
high-pitched scream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible?!” They were just about to join forces against Ning, but
the Kingfreak was almost instantly killed. Both Daolord Shaka and
Daolord Snowjoy were rather stunned by this.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream!” Ji
Ning turned his murderous gaze towards Sectlord Timedream. The more
guilt he felt towards Ninedust, the more badly he wanted to kill the
Kingfreak and Timedream. “Die!” He howled through the air as he
shot towards Timedream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream’s
face instantly turned ashen. His forte lay in heartforce; in close
combat, he was slightly weaker than even the Kingfreak. How could he
be a match for Ning? He frantically retreated while sending mentally
to Daolord Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy, “Brother Shaka, brother
Snowjoy, come and help me! If I die, the next ones to fall shall be
the two of you. Given the power of his heartworld projection and the
suppressive force of his secret arts, neither of you will be able to
fly faster than a hundred times the speed of light. There’s no way
he won’t be able to chase you down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Snowjoy charged
straight towards Ning, laughing loudly. “Daolord Darknorth, you
were actually able to force me to retreat just now, but that was only
because you caught me offguard. Let’s try again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Shaka!”
Sectlord Timedream continued to urge Shaka onwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream, Ji Ning’s
heartforce illusions are extremely terrifying,” Daolord Shaka sent
mentally. “I’m afraid to go too close to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s there to be
afraid of? Freak had a flawed Dao-heart, which was why he fell so
easily. Look at Daolord Snowjoy; does he look the slightest bit
worried?” Sectlord Timedream sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kingfreak was the
only one of the twenty supreme Daolords who was the servant of
another. He was willing to serve Sectlord Timedream and was
completely loyal to him, viewing the Sectlord’s life as being more
important than his own life. This was precisely because Sectlord
Timedream had spent countless years slowly guiding him and molding
him, resulting in the Kingfreak’s unswerving loyalty. As a result,
the Kingfreak’s Dao-heart did indeed have certain flaws… and it
was Sectlord Timedream himself who had laid the seeds for that flaw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream, don’t
try to take me for a fool.” Daolord Shaka sent disdainfully, “I’m
not a match for Darknorth. There’s no way I’m going to engage him
in close combat… but don’t worry. I’ll help you from afar with
my magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of six golden
plumes appeared, one after the other, then transformed into six
streaks of light that shot towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Daolord
Snowjoy once more began to battle against each other. Rumble… Ning
once more cast the [Dreamstar] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless
against me. I’ve tempered myself countless times in life-and-death
situations. Your illusory arts aren’t even close to being able to
shake me.” Daolord Snowjoy was filled with the urge to do battle,
as he truly did love combat. He knew that Sectlord Timedream was
making use of him, but he still charged forwards unwaveringly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, my illusions
still aren’t strong enough.” Ning did understand this. If he
wanted to be able to sweep through all supreme Daolords with his
illusions, he would have to reach the same level as Daolord
Featherdress. Perhaps the strength of Ning’s heartforce was on par
with Daolord Featherdress’, but his [Dreamstar] art was a far cry
from being on par with the completed [Featherdress Soulthrall Song].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I don’t
use illusions, you still aren’t a match for me.” Ning was
incomparably savage in battle, and his six Northbow swords were
filled with incredible might as he blew through Daolord Snowjoy’s
attacks like they were rotted wood. Although Ning’s Omega Sword Dao
- Heavenbreaker was a brute-force attack, it was also ephemeral and
unpredictable, making it impossible for Daolord Snowjoy to dodge and
forcing him to take the attacks head-on each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! After
receiving several blows in a row, Daolord Snowjoy and his two Stargod
clones were all knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream, hurry
over here and help me out!” Daolord Snowjoy roared mentally. “I
can’t stop him by myself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Snowjoy, at
least he won’t be able to kill you. This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to temper yourself1” Sectlord Timedream sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you refuse to
come help, I’m going to leave. The person Darknorth really wants to
kill right now is you!” Daolord Snowjoy said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Seeing
this, Sectlord Timedream had no choice but to grit his teeth and
swallow his rage. “Haha, since you’ve asked for my help, brother
Snowjoy… although I’m rather weak in close combat, I’ll still
come help out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, both
Daolord Snowjoy and Sectlord Timedream attacked Ning together, with
Daolord Shaka’s six golden plumes striking towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning’s heartworld projection and his nine novessence arts continued
to apply pressure to the two of them, but Sectlord Timedream’s
heartworld projection was able to alleviate some of the pressure as
Timedream sent it crashing against Ning’s projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six Northbow swords in
hand, Ning faced off against all his foes: Daolord Snowjoy, his two
Stargod clones, Sectlord Timedream, and the six incredibly fast
golden plumes that moved more than a hundred times the speed of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
that you can hold on forever against the attacks of three supreme
Daolords!” The distant Daolord Shaka truly didn’t wish to accept
such an outcome. These six golden plumes he was controlling from afar
were amongst the most valuable treasures this Aberrant form of his
was in control of, and he had already bound them into lifeblood
treasures. Generally speaking, when he encountered tough foes he
would use them to attack from afar. The plumes were unpredictable and
incredibly sharp, allowing him to chop through his foes with howling
strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Sectlord
Timedream manifested six arms as well, with each arm holding onto a
pitch-black claw-weapon. This was a very special type of weapon, and
the tips of the claws were covered with spots of white light. When he
brandished his claws, they danced out in a dreamlike manner that made
Ning feel as though he was daydreaming; in fact, Ning even felt as
though he was growing drowsy. However, as one of the most supreme
Heartforce Cultivator Daolords, Ning was able to easily endure this
special attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fight laid bare
the differences between Ning and Sectlord Timedream! Ning simply
hadn’t been training long enough; the only heartforce abilities he
had were his [Heartforce Eradicator] and his [Dreamstart] art. These
were indeed killer techniques, but Ning hadn’t yet spent any time
in coming up with ordinary heartforce-infused combat techniques or
techniques which could infect the foe with heartforce. He just hadn’t
had the time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, die!”
Sectlord Timedream’s lips continuously mumbled this word, sending
them echoing with Ning’s mind like a demonic chant as he repeatedly
used his claws to lash out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream, my
heartworld is even faster than yours! For you to use such puny tricks
against me is an absolute joke.” Ning was filled with the desire to
kill this man. He used just a portion of his sword-light to defend
against Daolord Shaka’s treasures and Sectlord Timedream’s
attacks; the only one bringing Ning some real pressure was Daolord
Snowjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Snowjoy, in
defenses alone, was ranked amongst the top three Daolords. Even
though Ning had the advantage of his nine novessence arts and his
heartworld projection, he was only able to knock Daolord Snowjoy back
rather than truly defeat him. As for right now, when Ning was
surrounded by three opponents? He wasn’t even able to knock Daolord
Snowjoy back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful!” Daolord Snowjoy and his two Stargod clones continued to
furiously assault Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Snowjoy,
hurry up and depart!” Ning was growing impatient as well. His six
Northbow swords flowed outwards in dominating strikes, allowing him
to hold a slight advantage even though it was a three-on-one fight!
However, if this continued he would have no chance of actually
winning this fight. And in truth, Ning didn’t even really want to
fight Daolord Snowjoy. Daolord Snowjoy was a worthy foe, but what
Ning really wanted to do was to kill Timedream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was still
suffering terrifying pain within Ning’s estate-world. He was a
supreme Daolord, but he had begged for Ning to kill him! How
horrifying was the pain he was in? Ning swore to himself that he
would kill Sectlord Timedream, but Daolord Snowjoy was barring his
path. “Why won’t you fuck off?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Daolord
Darknorth, I’m impressed at your strength. You are able to fight
us, one against three! However, with brother Snowjoy here, you won’t
be able to harm us at all,” Sectlord Timedream laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first one I’m
going to kill is you.” Ning didn’t even try to disguise his
murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
even more supreme Daolords will arrive here. In the end, you’ll be
the one to die!” Sectlord Timedream didn’t attempt to hide his
murderous feelings either. If you raised a dog long enough, you’d
eventually grow attached to it. The Kingfreak had been his most
devoted retainer and had followed him for countless years. Whenever
Timedream found a second copy of a good treasure he already wanted,
he was willing to give it to the Kingfreak. This was a testament to
how deep their relationship was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had killed the
Kingfreak. Sectlord Timedream was filled with the desire to kill Ning
as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning
repeatedly clashed against Snowjoy and Timedream in midair. Whoosh!
Ning suddenly retreated, flying backwards at a hundred times the
speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is he fleeing?”
Sectlord Timedream immediately shouted, “Chase him down! Don’t
let him escape! Slow him down as much as we can. Once the other
Daolords arrive, he won’t be able to hold us off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase him down.”
Daolord Snowjoy and Timedream all chased after Ning, but they were
much slower than him and were quickly shaken off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The distant,
escaping Ning suddenly vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did he suddenly
vanish?” Sectlord Timedream’s face turned pale. He couldn’t
help but begin to slow down, due to his habitual caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord
Snowjoy continued the pursuit, studying the area carefully with his
godsense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did he suddenly
vanish?” The distant Daolord Shaka was puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
vigilantly scanned the area. “Eh?” He suddenly sensed a
premonition of incredible, life-threatening danger approaching him.
His face instantly turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! An incredibly
soft blade struck out, wrapping itself around his waist like a rope
and tying him up almost instantly. A heartbeat later, someone
appeared in front of Sectlord Timedream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a white-robed
youth with three heads, six arms, and murderous eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Sectlord
Timedream revealed a look of shock and terror. “How is this
possible? Y-you… your evasion arts can avoid even godsense?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Omega Sword Dao,
Shadowless sword-intent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming a
Daolord of the Third Step, Ning’s Blood Drop stance was able to
surpass both space and time! As for the Shadowless stance, it had
also reached incredible heights and was now able to perfectly avoid
even godsense, allowing Ning to catch his enemies completely offguard
and then capture them! This was a terrifying killer move. Over the
course of countless chaos cycles, every so often one of the elite
Daolords would be able to come up with this type of killer move, and
in each case they would instantly be ranked amongst the top three
Daolords of that era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This killer move was
even more terrifying than the three killer moves of the Radiant King!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ji Ning’s
sword wrapped itself around Sectlord Timedream’s waist, binding him
in a soft grasp as his other five swords simultaneously shot towards
the Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Sectlord
Timedream’s entire body transformed to become almost translucent as
he became a crystalline shadow, quickly escaping his bonds and
fleeing far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Ning’s five swords carried all-encompassing destructive
force. This was his Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop, and it destroyed
all in its path! The five streaks of light pursued after the humanoid
streak of light and stabbed it head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The humanoid
streak of light reformed far off in the distance into Sectlord
Timedream. His face was ashen, and he clutched at his chest, a few
specks of blood appearing at his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had his
dreamform technique, it clearly wasn’t as formidable as the likes
of the abilities which the Ninedust Sectlord or Daolord Shaka
possessed. The Ninedust Sectlord’s invulnerable aquaform was truly
formidable, while Daolord Shaka’s was also superior, allowing the
latter to transform into endless streams of light. The strength of a
protective ability was in large part dependent on the cultivator’s
specific Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning’s
path was that of the Omega Sword Dao. Although it gave him incredible
strength in battle, he didn’t have a special ability like aquaform,
lightform, dreamform, the ability to transform into darkness
incarnate, etc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream’s
dreamform was a bit weak, but it was still enough to allow him to
escape from Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This evasion art…?”
The distant Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka all turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run, immediately!”
Daolord Shaka bellowed mentally, “Snowjoy, we need to flee right
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this one of the
legendary assassination arts?” Daolord Snowjoy was still gripped by
shock and terror. He immediately followed Daolord Shaka in
immediately fleeing off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me out, the two
of you!” After having just barely escaped the last attack, Sectlord
Timedream sent mentally to the two of them, “If you work with me,
we might be able to withstand Darknorth. If you are willing to help
me, I’m willing to split all of the treasures I own with you two!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord Timedream,
please pardon us for being unable to assist you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Timedream,
you need to come up with something on your own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka and
Daolord Snowjoy couldn’t even be bothered to pay any attention to
Timedream. They moved in unison, Daolord Shaka ‘carrying’ Daolord
Snowjoy in fleeing more than a hundred times the speed of light and
quickly disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at them, not bothering to chase after them. Of the three, Daolord
Shaka was the toughest to kill as he was able to move more than a
hundred times the speed of light and was also able to transform into
light itself; to kill him was extremely troublesome. This was much
like how Sectlord Timedream, Shaka, Kingfreak, and Snowjoy had worked
together to kill Ninedust, but Ninedust had been able to rely on his
invulnerable aquaform to render them helpless. In the end, they had
to rely on the redscatter venom to deal with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any and every supreme
Daolord was extremely difficult to kill. Generally speaking, they all
had extremely powerful life-preserving abilities! Fortunately, the
Waveshift Realm served to suppress many spacetime effects, making it
difficult for the supreme Daolords to flee. This was the only reason
why there was a chance for some of them to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daolord Shaka flew
away, he continued to be surrounded by those six enormous golden
plumes. Every single plume was extremely large, roughly thirty or so
meters in size. When the six joined together, they curled together
into a ball that completely protected him as he fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this magic
treasure surrounding me, Daolord Darknorth won’t be able to breach
my defenses and appear right next to me.” Daolord Shaka had an ugly
look on his face as he continued to fly at high speed, Snowjoy in
tow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually has an
assassination art.” Daolord Snowjoy was still in a state of
disbelief. “This type of terrifying evasion art has once more
appeared in the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The term ‘assassination
arts’ referred to arts akin to Ning’s Shadowless evasion art.
Many generations ago, there was a supreme Daolord who had come up
with this type of evasion art. His evasion arts allowed him to
stealthily move close to his foes, and not even godsense was able to
detect him. By the time his opponents did detect him, it was far too
late! This was quite terrifying, and as a result quite a few supreme
Daolords died by this assassin’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time he went out
on an assassination mission, his target perished. As a result, the
existence of his assassination art had remained a secret. Only much
later on did he fail in an assassination attempt, resulting in the
existence of his special evasion art being leaked out. As a result,
all the other supreme Daolords began to maintain maximum vigilance at
all times, making it much harder for him to assassinate any others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starting today, when
we’re roaming the outside world we should hide within a flying
vessel,” Daolord Snowjoy said. “The flying vessel is protected by
wards; even if he wishes to ambush us, he needs to first break the
wards apart. There won’t be a way for him to silently sneak up on
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Using secret arts to
cover a wide area and assault everything within it is another way to
prevent him from drawing too close to us. Unfortunately, Darknorth’s
heartworld projection and secret arts are all quite formidable. Even
Sectlord Timedream’s heartworld projection was crushed by them.”
Daolord Shaka shook his head. “Ugh. This Darknorth fellow is far
too terrifying. I’m using my magic treasures to protect us from all
sides, but he can stealthily appear right outside them without me
being the wiser.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daolord
Snowjoy felt nervous as well. Now that the two of them knew that Ning
had an assassination art, both of them felt quite vexed. Anyone who
Ning targeted would live in a perpetual nightmare, because by the
time they saw Ning, Ning would already be right next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream is so
screwed,” Shaka said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, his
focus is on Timedream and not us,” Snowjoy said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he was to come
after us… although we’d stand a good chance of surviving, we’d
definitely suffer some serious injuries,” Shaka said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
continued to furiously flee as countless strands of silk seemed to
swirl around him. Clearly, he wanted to ensure that Ning wouldn’t
be able to ambush him again. As he fled, he sent frantic mental
please to Ning: “Brother Darknorth, I beg that you spare me. I’m
willing to give you all of my treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Timedream.” Ning
wielded all six Northbow swords in his three-headed, six-armed form
as he continued the pursuit. “I was willing to reveal my Shadowless
evasion art in front of Daolord Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy, precisely
because I wish to kill you! There’s no one who can rescue you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeping the Shadowless
evasion art secret was incredibly important to him, as only when it
was a secret would it be fully effective. Once word of it spread, all
the Daolords would be on their guard. Although it would still be
dangerous, it would no longer be lethally effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning felt
confident in his chances nonetheless. He not only had heartforce
techniques, he also had tremendously strong close combat abilities!
The Shadowless evasion art was a killer move of his, but if it had to
be revealed it had to be revealed. If he was strong enough, he didn’t
have to worry about his techniques being revealed to all. Even if
they knew about his techniques, he’d still be able to crush them in
a frontal battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I have
many life-preserving abilities. It won’t be easy for you to kill me
either.” When Timedream saw Ning draw closer and closer to him, he
barked mentally, “Don’t push me too far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll pushing you
to your wit’s end!” Ning actually sped up the pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then go die!”
Timedream’s face turned savage as he produced a black stone which
was covered with countless golden spots that came together to form a
strage diagram. Sectlord Timedream crushed the black stone, causing
an overwhelming torrent of power to instantly flood out and form a
dazzling halo of golden light around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
Swish! He disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is he? Where
is he?!” Sectlord Timedream was anxious and angry. His heartworld
projection was weaker than Ning’s, and Ning was using his own
heartworld projection and nine novessence arts to prevent the
Sectlord from scanning the area. As a result, he naturally wasn’t
able to find Ning’s true location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Sectlord
Timedream let out an enraged roar as he caused the dazzling halo of
golden light around him to explode outwards in every direction,
striking all within their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Roughly a hundred
thousand kilometers away, some of the energy struck an obstacle.
Moments later Ning appeared, Northbow swords at the ready.
Sword-light gleamed in front of him, transforming into a black hole
that allowed him to easily defend against the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord Timedream,
even if the full power of that strike was concentrated on me, it
would only be able to cause me a few injuries at most,” Ning
smirked. “As for when its spread out like this? It poses no threat
at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power contained
within that treasure was roughly on par with 60% - 70% of a
full-power strike from one of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities.
Ning was now a supreme Daolord and just one stage away from their
level. Even if one of the eight lords personally intervened, they
wouldn’t be able to kill Ning with one blow, given the fact that he
was protected by the Hegemon armor! An area attack? Completely out of
the question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Sectlord
Timedream gritted his teeth, then turned and continued to flee at
high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His evasion art is
impossible to deal with. Whenever I take out a treasure, he’ll use
this ‘Shadowless’ evasion art and I won’t even be able to hit
him!” Sectlord Timelord was turning frantic. “Even if I had a
Hegemon-level treasure, I still probably wouldn’t be able to kill
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the most powerful
of treasures needed a target. When Ning used his Shadowless evasion
art, he was able to completely and totally vanish. Given that he was
able to move at a hundred times the speed of light, he would be able
to easily move a million kilometers away in the blink of an eye.
There was simply no way for him to aim at or hit Ning. When he
unleashed the power in a dispersed area attack, it would quickly
become a hundred times weaker than normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning once more
flew straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s faster than
me, and his heartworld projection is stronger than mine. How am I
supposed to escape?” Sectlord Timedream was about to go crazy. He
was both slower and weaker than his opponent. His strength lay in
heartforce, but Ning was also a powerful Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Waveshift.
Damn you, Emperor Waveshift!” Sectlord Timedream felt hatred in his
heart. “If we were in the outside world, I would’ve torn a hole
through spacetime and fled long ago.” He had plenty of treasures
that would allow him to flee through spacetime, and more than one at
that!
</P>

Chapter 22 - End of the Road
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, with
six hours going past in the blink of an eye. During theses six hours,
Sectlord Timedream used a total of nine offensive items, all of which
had the power of lords of the eight Sacred Cities. Some were
stronger, some were slightly weaker. However, Ji Ning’s usage of
the Shadowless evasion art rendered Sectlord unable to aim the
treasures. As a result, Ning was able to block the attacks
effortlessly; he wasn’t even knocked backwards by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He just disappeared
again.” Sectlord Timedream continued to flee in terror. He glanced
backwards, unable to discern where Ning had gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An explosive
sound rang out as the countless threads surrounding him shuddered as
something slammed into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s here
again!” Sectlord Timedream stared ashen-faced at Ji Ning, who had
just appeared. Ning had already burst through those threads and was
charging straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Swish! Whoosh! The streaks of sword-light shot towards him, some
fast, some slow, some savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream was
being completely dominated. Even Daolord Snowjoy wasn’t a match for
Ning in close combat, to say nothing of Timedream. Timedream was, by
comparison, much weaker in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. He once more
transformed into a stream of light-silhouettes that then reformed off
in the distance. This was his dreamform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning’s
sword-light didn’t slow down in the slightest as it pursued with
its chops, stabs, and strikes against the humanoid silhouette.
Although Timedream’s dreamform was able to dissipate a great deal
of his attack power, it clearly was far inferior to the likes of the
invulnerable aquaform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sectlord Timedream
reformed off in the distance, his face ashen. He hurriedly gulped
down a few spirit-pills, a look of despair in his eyes. In six short
hours, he had been forced to use his dreamform to flee over a hundred
times. Each time, he had been heavily injured and needed to rely on
spirit-pills to heal himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see just
how many spirit-pills you have.” Ning was still brimming with a
murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
spare my life. Spare my life! I’m willing to be your retainer for a
chaos cycle, and I’ll give you all of my treasures. What do you
think?” Sectlord Timedream once more begged for mercy, and this
time he actively offered to serve as a retainer for a chaos cycle. He
was an extremely proud man; it was a testament to how much despair he
felt that he was willing to serve another as a retainer and hand over
all of his treasures. He wanted to save his own life, but he was out
of all other ideas. He had used up an enormous number of
spirit-pills. If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to last for so
much as another day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A retainer? You are
weaker than me, and your heartforce is inferior to mine as well. What
would be the point of taking you on as a retainer?” Ning barked
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going too
far!” Sectlord Timedream roared coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn right I am!”
Ning didn’t even try to disguise his hatred. Given how long he had
chased after Timedream, how could he stop now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would be nice,
having someone as powerful as Timedream as his retainer… but Ning
would never forget that it was Sectlord Timedream who was primarily
responsible for Ninedust being forced to suffer such agony. The guilt
Ning felt towards Ninedust prevented him from sparing Timedream!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare my life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you, Waveshift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why, why, why?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t accept
this! This is ridiculous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage! Winesage!
Hurry up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why? WHY?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As death slowly moved
closer and closer to Sectlord Timedream, he began to go completely
insane. Although Winesage was moving closer and closer to Ning, he
was still a few days ago. Sectlord Timedream wouldn’t be able to
hold on for much longer. As for the other supreme Daolords, they
didn’t even dare to move too close to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shaka, Snowjoy,
Kingfreak, and Timedream… these four supreme Daolords had attacked
Darknorth. And what had happened? Kingfreak died! Shaka and Snowjoy
had been terrified into fleeing! And Timedream had been chased to the
brink of death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Something like this was
more than enough to terrify the vast majority of Daolords.
Second-tier Daolords wouldn’t even dare to think about getting
involved, while even the supreme Daolords grew nervous! Most likely,
only Winesage felt no fear at all, but he still had to make it here
in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can it be that
things will end up with me dying here?” Sectlord Timedream’s aura
continued to weaken. He once more transformed into a humanoid
light-silhouette, then raised his head to stare despondently at the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s merciless
sword-light once more came howling towards him, chopping towards the
humanoid light-silhouette. The humanoid light-silhouette slowly began
to dim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, today I’m
going to die by your hand… but in the future, you will die as well!
Ahaha…” Sectlord Timedream’s light-silhouette let out a berserk
laugh as he continued to grow dimmer and dimmer. In the end his
silhouette completely vanished, leaving just a few magic treasures
behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting the left-over treasures. Prior to dying, Sectlord
Timedream had used up all of his Dao-seals and other disposable
treasures. Since he wasn’t going to be able to escape, he didn’t
want to let his death to benefit Ning any more than necessary. Only a
few unbreakable treasures and precious materials ended up in Ning’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair, staring at the distant mountain peaks. He remained very calm.
He could still sense the Ninedust Sectlord within his estate-world,
and a hint of guilt appeared on his face. He murmured softly,
“Brother Ninedust, hold on. Keep holding on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And big brother
Solesky…” Ning could also sense Daolord Solesky remaining in
secluded meditation within a different estate. “Once you come out,
I’ll expect an explanation from you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had indeed made a
breakthrough, which was why he had managed to turn defeat into
victory! He had defeated Shaka and Snowjoy, then slain both Kingfreak
and Timedream. But if he hadn’t made that breakthrough, both he and
Ninedust would’ve been finished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big brother Solesky,
I’ll demand an explanation from you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was fairly calm
after having killed Timedream, but the countless other Daolords
within the Waveshift Realm were all in a state of shock. He had
fought four supreme Daolords by himself and won! Two had fled in
terror while the other two, ‘Kingfreak’ and ‘Sectlord
Timedream’, had died?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When King Gorsch had
died, it had been because he was outnumbered. Ning, however, had been
the outnumbered one… and he had instead killed two of his
attackers, supreme Daolords both! This was completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
also trains as a Heartforce Cultivator! His heartworld projection is
even stronger than Sectlord Timedream’s was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
skilled in one of those legendary assassination arts. Godsense cannot
locate him, allowing him to quietly appear in front of you without
any trace at all. He’s utterly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
also extremely strong in close combat. In close combat, he was able
to defeat four supreme Daolords at once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of news
spread throughout the land. Countless other Daolords were in a state
of horror as yet another terrifying supreme Daolord appeared within
their midst!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce was
strong enough that all second-tier Daolords were in a state of
terror, as well as a few supreme Daolords! Even if you were skilled
in escape, so what? If you weren’t able to resist Ning’s
heartforce, you’d still perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His assassination arts
struck fear in the hearts of supreme Daolords, while his close combat
skills were without flaw. He was even more terrifying than the
Radiant King, Sectlord Timedream, Palace Lord Dawnstar, and the
others! He was someone who was so terrifying, he could be spoken of
in the same breath as Winesage! If Winesage didn’t have a Universe
treasure, his position might be in danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Virtually all of the
supreme Daolords of this era were within the Waveshift Realm, and
this naturally attracted the attention of the various organizations,
the Palace of Immortals included.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop an Immortal bridge
which was deep within the distant Palace of Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed elder and
a bald, golden-furred alien were seated on this bridge, drinking some
wine. Next to them hovered a large mirror which was displaying images
of what was happening inside the Waveshift Realm. They were able to
clearly see the scenes of Ning fighting against four supreme Daolords
as well as his slaying of Timedream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old brother
Blackcloud, this Darknorth kid is pretty tough. He’s even tougher
than your disciple,” the gold-furred alien said in a praising tone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In close combat
alone, my disciple should be on par with him. The thing is, this
Darknorth kid is extremely balanced in every area. He’s without
flaw. My disciple’s attacks might be a bit more powerful, thanks to
that bloodblade of his…” The black-robed, black-haired man paused
momentarily as he gave his evaluation. “Still… only people like
him who are balanced and flawless are able to survive for long
periods of time. His sword-arts are completely without flaw and are
perfect in every aspect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The bald,
gold-furred alien nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Darknorth also concurrently trains as a Heartforce Cultivator, and
has extremely strong heartforce.” The black-robed elder nodded. “I
feel as though I’m seeing the second coming of Winesage. Winesage
was like this as well, but he now has a Universe treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without it, it’d
be hard for me to say which of the two is stronger; they’d have to
fight it out,” the gold-furred alien said. “Now that he does have
that Universe treasure, he’s the undisputed number one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity. The exalted
rank of number one Daolord is ‘owned’ by a Daolord of the Dark
Kingdom.” The black-robed elder shook his head. “Although
Darknorth is a member of the Brightshore Kingdom, he’s still a
member of our Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance was a
very relaxed organization. One could join the Brightshore Kingdom or
even the Ancient cultivators without causing much of a fuss. However,
joining the Aeonian Kingdom or the Dark Kingdom was a no-no; those
organizations were mortal enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to change the
listings again.” The gold-furred alien produced that golden book
once more. “I’ve changed the listings more in the past few years
than I have in the past thousand chaos cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He flipped the book
open. The book was filled with lines of names. He filled the book
with his Immortal energy, and the names instantly began to change
once more. As they did, all of the other subordinates of the Palace
of Immortals received notification and began to spread the news.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endless
Territories, this was the latest listing:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top Daolord:
Winesage <BR> The second Daolord: Daolord Darknorth <BR> The third

Chapter 23 - Another Hegemon
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This updating of the
Daolord rankings was quickly spread throughout the Endless
Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop an icy chaos
planet. This planet had been frozen into a solid ball of ice for
trillions of years, and a cold, knife-sharp wind swept across its
surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures were seated
atop this planet facing each other. The first was a white-bearded old
man who had six horns on his head and who was dressed in snowy robes.
This was the Brightshore Hegemon. The other person in front of him
was a single-horned young man dressed in deep blue robes. The youth
had a few scales on his face, and his eyes seemed to contain the
stars themselves. He radiated an aura of peace and calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightshore, this
realmverse of yours really has quite a few incredible Daolords.”
The horned youth smiled. “That Winesage is not only a Heartforce
Cultivator, he also has a Universe treasure. The only thing that
‘Darknorth’ kid needs is a Universe treasure; once he gets that,
he’ll be every bit Winesage’s equal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” The
Brightshore Hegemon began to laugh. “Welkin, do you know how long
Darknorth has been training for?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long?” The
horned youth was startled. The public ranking didn’t even include
each cultivator’s special techniques, much less details such as how
long they had been cultivating for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than a chaos
cycle,” the Brightshore Hegemon said. “To be more precise… for
less than a hundred million years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The horned
youth said in shock, “How is that possible? I’ve visited
countless places while wandering through the vast Great Dark,
including quite a few alternate universes. To train to become a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, especially one of such power… without
question, every single person I met spent an enormous amount of time
to reach such a level. Samsara Daolords… each step they take is
extremely difficult and more difficult than the last! To go from the
third step to the fourth step in particular requires an inordinate
amount of time. How could he have accomplished it in less than a
hundred million years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it’s the
truth. He belongs to my Brightshore Kingdom.” The Brightshore
Hegemon grew even more smug. “Impressed yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such a short time
period.” The horned youth said softly, “He must have encountered
some special circumstances, such as entering a region where time
naturally flows much, much faster than normal. It might seem to us as
though less than a hundred million years have gone past, but in
reality he must’ve trained for thousands of times longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps.” The
Brightshore Hegemon chuckled. “Even if that’s true, that’s
still a very short period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless Great Dark
contained infinite possibilities. Even Hegemons had to slowly drift
through it, and venturing forth to another realmverse was incredibly
difficult. There would also be a number of unique, special danger
zones within it. Normally, cultivators could at most train a hundred
times faster than the normal flow of time, but some of the natural
zones produced by the Great Dark could accelerate time to be ten
thousand times faster than normal, or even faster! This was the
ineffable power of nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, no one in the
Endless Territories knew that Ning was actually just a Daolord of the
Third Step! It actually made sense for him to train this quickly from
the first step to the third step, given that he had the help of the
Stone Censer of Reunion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect to
encounter such a monstrously talented Daolord upon visiting you in
your realmverse.” The horned youth quickly calmed down, as by now
he truly had seen far too many amazing things. “Still, it’s
extremely difficult for these supreme Daolords to succeed in the
Daomerge. Given how talented they are, if they were to succeed they
would instantly reach our level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Brightshore Hegemon nodded. Their level… even in the endless Great
Dark, they stood amongst the very pinnacle of power amonst experts.
It was far, far too difficult for supreme Daolords to reach their
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The emergence of the
Voidsea Jadeseals within the Waveshift Realm has caused me to hear
the whispers of fate, awakening me from my slumber,” the horned
youth said. “The Waveshift Realm definitely isn’t as simple a
place as you might imagine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can vaguely sense
something as well.” The Brightshore Hegemon also frowned. “I
really wonder what Waveshift was planning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift has
reached such a level in the Dao of Numerancy that far, far too many
major powers are requesting his assistance. I wouldn’t be surprised
if he is in command of even more mysteries than the two of us,” the
horned youth said. “Let’s just watch and see for now. Let’s see
what secrets the Waveshift Realm holds, for it to cause us to sense
something! After this matters is resolved, I’ll be leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have recovered
from your wounds?” The Brightshore Hegemon asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More or less.” The
horned youth smiled. “I’ve spent so much time sleeping within
your universe. Now that I’m awake, it’s time for me to leave.
It’s a true pity. I was THIS close to becoming master of that
alternate universe. If I succeeded, I would have become an Otherverse
Lord! Alas, in the end I was surrounded and attacked by others.
Fortunately, I managed to flee in the nick of time. Otherwise, I
would’ve died there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every time there’s
a war over control of an otherverse, a large number of people will
perish.” The Brightshore Hegemon shook his head. “I’ve chosen
to remain in my homeland this entire time. My information network
isn’t as good as yours. To date, I haven’t taken part in so much
as a single one of those struggles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightshore, given
how strong you are, even if you failed you would still be able to
escape successfully. Even I’m not a match for your spacetime
fleeing abilities,” the horned youth said. “That’s why I told
you, long ago, that you should go off adventuring by my side. When
you visit more places and make more friends, you’ll naturally have
a larger information network. Eventually, you might become an
Otherverse Lord yourself. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I worry too much
about my clansmen,” the Brightshore Hegemon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You take too many
burdens onto yourself,” the horned youth said. “Look at me. Look
at how free and relaxed I am! I’m also a Chaos Godbeast, but I’ve
been to far more places than you have. My life isn’t nearly as
tiring as yours. We Chaos Godbeasts were meant to venture through the
stars by ourselves! Who gives a damn about the others? It’s enough
for me to be happy, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone has their
own preferences.” The Brightshore Hegemon smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Have you
found those six materials I asked you to look for?” The horned
youth asked, “Those six ingredients once turned up within this
universe of yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve found five of
them,” the Brightshore Hegemon said. “These items are all
incredibly rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve visited so
many places but still haven’t been able to acquire all six.” The
horned youth shook his head, unhappy. “Only when I have all of
these ingredients will I be able to fully master my Empyrean
Yang-Nine Ki! Ugh… if I had already mastered it during that last
struggle, I might’ve become an Otherverse Lord long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Empyrean
Yang-Nine Ki is one of the most supreme secret arts in existence. It
won’t be mastered as easily as that,” the Brightshore Hegemon
laughed. “I fear you’ll need to continue your travels through the
Great Dark and visit a few more places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be the
only one. This universe of yours will soon be annihilated by the
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels Wheels. By then, you’ll have to lead these
young fellows in wandering through the vast world as well,” the
horned youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels.” The Brightshore Hegemon hesitated, then slowly nodded.
“They are one of the most terrifying natural calamities the endless
primordial chaos has ever given birth to. Cultivators are not able to
resist their power. I’ll try to buy as much time as I can, but if
there really is nothing to be done then I really will have to go out
wandering as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not talk
about such depressing subjections.” The Brightshore Hegemon smiled.
“Let’s keep our focus on the Waveshift Realm. Given that even you
sense something strange about it, it definitely holds a significant
secret within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite.” The horned
youth grew eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of them was a
floating image of the scenes going on within the Waveshift Realm, and
at the center was the scene of Ji Ning fleeing at top speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning was the
center of attention of almost all the major powers of the entire
Endless Territories. Even some of the reclusive Eternal Emperors were
watching him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning didn’t
know and didn’t care about this. All he wanted to do was escape the
nine layers as soon as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
heartworld projection after another descended upon him, with the
strongest one at the center being controlled by Winesage. Ning had no
choice but to shrink his own heartworld projection in order to resist
theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Timedream
died, there were three Heartforce Cultivators left amongst the most
supreme Daolords; Ji Ning, Winesage, and Palace Lord Cloudwalker.
Cloudwalker was the lord of the Palace of the Heart of the
Brightshore Kingdom, which meant he naturally was a member of the
kingdom and bound by the lifeblood oath not to kill another member.
Thus, Cloudwalker had yet to do anything to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of just
heartworld projections alone, Ning was actually slightly superior to
Winesage! But if he expanded his heartworld projection and made it
too large, the power of his projection would drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, over twenty
second-tier Heartforce Daolords were working together to suppress
Ning. Just four or five of them working together equaled a first-tier
Daolord in might! However, these heartworld projections were a force
of energy that couldn’t actually be ‘merged’ together, and so
if Ning shrank the ‘footprint’ of his own heartworld projection,
his foes wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape, Darknorth.” A cold voice rang out far away. “Shaka and
the others managed to tie you down for long enough. We’ve already
set up an enormous cordon around the surrounding area, and I’m
quite close to you. I think you and I should have a little duel. If
I’m unable to defeat you, I’ll let you leave and cease my pursuit
of you. Without my presence, the other supreme Daolords probably
wouldn’t be able to do anything to you at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage.” Ning
continued to flee at a hundred times the speed of light. He barked
back, “You want to fight me? Then come catch up to me first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning certainly wasn’t
going to slow down. He wasn’t certain in his chances against
Winesage, after all!
</P>

Chapter 24 - Ji Ning and Winesage
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning continued to
flee. On the way, he encountered multiple squads of Daolords, but
none of them dared to engage him! Everyone knew how he had been able
to fight against four supreme Daolords and kill two of them; this
meant that Daolord Darknorth definitely was far too strong for them
to compete against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll all be up to
Winesage.” This was what countless Daolords were thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Palace Lord Dawnstar’s
ranking was now second only to Ning and Winesage’s. He was carrying
his giant machete on his back while seated in the lotus position at
the peak of a mountain, staring off into the distance as a streak of
light flew past. It was Ji Ning. Ning even cast a glance at Dawnstar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
Darknorth.” Dawnstar smiled at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,” Ning
said, then continued to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawnstar smiled as he
watched Ning depart. He was a member of the Brightshore Kingdom;
there was no way he would stop Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Palace of
Immortals has actually ranked Darknorth above me. I want to see just
how tough he is.” Dawnstar transformed into a streak of light that
stayed a respectable distance behind Ning. “Winesage was just
barely able to defeat me. Now that he has a Universe treasure, I
wonder what level of power he has reached.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawnstar was quite
eager to see what the results of Ning’s battle against Winesage
would be. It must be understood that the ranking given by the Palace
of Immortals did contain certain unspoken rules. For example, if you
defeated someone in open combat you would take their rank, such as
when Daolord Dreamlore defeated the Radiant King!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another way to gain a
ranking was to be acknowledged by countless other Daolords. Ning’s
feat of fighting against four supreme Daolords at once and even
killing Timedream and Kingfreak was something which Palace Lord
Dawnstar and the others would not have been able to do. Thus, the
many other Daolords all acknowledged that Ning was second only to
Winesage and as such he was ranked number two on the list.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
without a ‘real’ resolution to a fight one wouldn’t be given a
ranking. The Ninedust Sectlord and Daolord Snowjoy were both
extremely strong, but thus far neither of them had actually defeated
one of the top-ranked Daolords! Ninedust had been surrounded by
Kingfreak, Snowjoy, and Shaka; he hadn’t actually been able to beat
any of them, while his fight with Fiendqueen Dustrain had also been
inconclusive. Where should he be ranked at? Eight? Nine? Ten? This
was a matter of dispute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You had to either be
publicly acknowledged by the other Daolords, or defeat a ranked
Daolord in an open battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s publicly
acknowledged to be superior to me,” Dawnstar mused to himself.
“Given my Dao-heart, his heartforce shouldn’t be able to shake me
at all. As for close combat… I really do not fear Darknorth at all!
They’ve actually ranked him above me? I’ll have to find a chance
to spar with him, then beat him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Palace Lord Dawnstar
was an incredibly proud person. He naturally didn’t want to accept
the results of this new ranking at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage and
Dawnstar were already ranked above me. Now, even Darknorth is ranked
above me.” A red-robed youth clutching a blood-colored blade was
glaring off into the distance, a desire to do battle radiating from
him. “I actually beat the Radiant King. The only problem is, I
haven’t actually run into Dawnstar or Darknorth yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dreamlore was
very conceited. He didn’t want to bother with challenging ordinary
Daolords; the first one he challenged was the Radiant King, despite
the fact that none of the treasures of the Waveshift Realm had even
appeared! In the end, he had actually won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, he wanted to
challenge Dawnstar and Darknorth! If he won, he would then go on to
challenge Winesage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can stop my
saber.” Daolord Dreamlord was filled with the urge to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. He flew through
the skies at high speed, but he was still quite a distance aways from
Ning and Dawnstar. Right now, Ning and Dawnstar were located close to
each other, while Winesage was just two days away from Ning’s
position. As for Daolord Dreamlore, he was still more than ten days
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage knew exactly
where Ning was, but Ning didn’t know where Winesage was. More than
twenty second-tier Heartforce Daolords were using their heartworld
projection to suppress his, forcing him to keep it smaller in size
and making it impossible for him to actually locate Winesage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning was flying
just a few meters above the waters of a vast, turbid river. “Eh?”
Ning’s face suddenly tightened slightly. He came to a halt, staring
off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another figure had
appeared above the surface of the river. This was a man dressed in
ancient black robes that were covered with certain diagrams. The
man’s hair was rather tousled, and his eyes looked rather bleary.
He looked very unkempt, but just by standing there he somehow became
the center of this vast world. It was as though he was the hegemon of
this land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage,” Ning
murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Winesage smiled, his gaze slowly sharpening. “You won’t be able
to escape this fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. The top
seed against the second seed.” The Brightshore Hegemon and the
horned youth continued to watch things play out from their position
atop that frozen planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage is
approaching the end of his lifespan. He doesn’t have much time
left. Once he dies, Darknorth will be ranked number one. A chance to
watch the two of them fight is a rare opportunity indeed.” The
bald, gold-furred alien and the black-robed, black-haired elder
within the Palace of Immortals of the Dao Alliance were watching
eagerly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endless
Territories, everyone from Daolords to Hegemons were paying attention
to this fight. Of course, the Daolords wouldn’t be able to actually
watch the fight in person or know the details of it, but they were
still waiting to see what the results would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top Daolord against
the second Daolord! The former had stood atop the rankings for
countless years and now was in possession of a Universe treasure. The
other had trained for a very brief period of time and had risen to
sudden prominence, and had just slain the Kingfreak and Timedream
just a short while ago. His momentum seemed unstoppable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above that vast river.
Ning and Winesage stared at each other from afar, neither daring to
underestimate the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a long,
long time since I have lost to anyone. Dawnstar and the Radiant King
were very close to me in power, but they are still a bit weaker.” A
desire to do battle burned in Winesage’s eyes. Although his voice
was quite calm, it still echoed in the air above this river. “The
reason they are weaker is because neither of them are Heartforce
Cultivators! You, however, are a Heartforce Cultivator. You stand a
chance at beating me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course…
that’s only in the event that I decline to use my Universe
treasure.” Winesage laughed calmly. “Don’t worry. For now, I
won’t use it! If you can’t even beat me when I don’t use my
Universe treasure, you should just go ahead and hand the seal over.
It’s rare for me to encounter a worthy opponent. I don’t want to
kill you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage’s words were
calm but filled with arrogance and invincible pride. Even without his
Universe treasure, he was still invincible amongst his fellow
Daolords! Now that he had one, he truly did look down upon all of his
so-called peers. He now generally spent his time with ancient Eternal
Emperors and rarely interacted with Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you don’t
want to kill me? We haven’t even fought yet. What makes you so sure
you can kill me? Even if you use your Universe treasure, you still
won’t be able to do anything to me.” Ning let out a cold snort.
“Let’s cut the crap. Take this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning vanished
into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
assassination art?” Winesage’s face tightened slightly. Boom!
Instantly, an awesome aura of bloody light swept out from Winesage,
as well as a heartworld projection that was filled with the essence
of darkness and death. The two joined together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! A
series of explosive sounds rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had merged his
nine novessence arts with his heartworld projection, while Winesage
had merged his bloodlight arts with his heartworld projection. The
two clashed against each other, with Ning holding the slight
advantage. However, the bloody halo of light around Winesage was
still able to maintain a diameter of roughly ten thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s silhouette
suddenly appeared outside of that field of bloody light. “Your
secret arts are pretty strong,” Ning praised. The energy of the
bloodlight art and the heartworld projection worked together
seamlessly to destroy all within their path. If Ning was to enter its
range, he would be attacked by it. His past opponents, such as
Timedream and Shaka, had weaker secret arts and heartworld
projections than Ning. As a result, they had suffered for it in
battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You secret arts are
even stronger, but its auxiliary effects are inferior to mine.”
Winesage nodded. “This secret art of mine is known as the Asura
Domain, and my heartforce and perfectly join together with it. Foes
that clash against me not only have to deal with the pressure from my
heartworld projection and the Asura Domain, they also have to endure
heartforce attacks from me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Asura Domain?”
Ning nodded. He had heard of some of Winesage’s supreme attacks
before. When Heartforce Cultivators were unable to effectively use
either brute-force attacks or illusions, they would need to use
softer and more insidious methods. Winesage’s Asura Domain was a
good example of this. This was a technique that combined both secret
arts and heartforce, giving it both a terrifyingly strong suppressive
effect as well as a corrosive, soul-invading effect. Any cultivator
caught within it would grow increasingly irritable as the fight went
on. This impact on their emotions would make it difficult for them to
stay in top fighting shape and unleash their full power, resulting in
them losing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own plan was
to master the [Heartsword] technique and do the same. He had gained a
basic level of insight into it long ago, but the later stages were
extremely difficult. To date, he hadn’t spent enough time on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would take him very,
very long to advance from the third step to the fourth step as a
Daolord. He would have plenty of time to work on the [Heartsword]
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Talk is cheap. All
the talk in the world won’t make you one whit stronger. Show me
what you actually have.” Ning immediately manifested [Three Heads,
Six Arms] and held six Northbow swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning unleashed
his nine novessence arts and his heartworld projection at the same
time. Ning and Winesage quickly began to move closer and closer to
each other, their secret arts and heartworld projections crashing
against each other like two worlds colliding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” Ning
was incomparably valiant as he charged straight towards Winesage,
immediately using his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker. His six
Northbow swords were filled with seemingly inexhaustible power, and
all of that power exploded like a series of volcano towards Winesage.

Chapter 25 - A Duel of Supremes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage continued to
stand there. His face remained placid, but his eyes narrowed
slightly. He didn’t move to dodge the Omega Sword Dao -
Heavenbreaker. Instead, he manifested a total of six arms and slowly
raised them up high. All six of his hands seemed to contain a
strange, marvelous amount of power within them. If mere World-level
cultivators were present, their souls and truesouls could well be
wiped out just via watching this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, being a major
power on the same level as Winesage, naturally didn’t have to worry
about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exterminate!”
Winesage’s six hands simultaneously flipped open and struck
outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning’s six
Northbow swords furiously struck down as well. It was a head-on
collision of frontal attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning and Winesage
were both knocked backwards. A terrifying shockwave of power swept
out in every direction, causing even distant spectators like Palace
Lord Dawnstar to be affected by it. Dawnstar revealed a look of
surprise: “Winesage’s [Extermination Palms] are incredibly
dominating, but Darknorth was actually able to block it head-on. The
two actually fought to a standstill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad at all. Take
another attack from me!” Winesage found his footing atop the water,
then charged forwards once more as his six arms spread out in a slow,
gentle manner like the wings of a roc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Winesage moved
closer and closer to Ning, carrying a surge of ghostly power with
him. His body gave birth to a myriad of shadowy after-images, and his
six arms seemed to transform into countless blurs, almost as though
he had thousands of arms. Every single hand used different stances,
such as claws, palms, or gentle pushes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage glided towards
Ning like a ghost or a dream, his countless hands all reaching out
towards him. If the [Extermination Palms] represented the utmost in
hard, aggressive, Yang-style destruction, then this technique
represented the utmost in soft, gentle, Yin-style attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring it!” Ning
was overjoyed upon seeing this. He charged straight towards Winesage,
his six Northbow swords transforming to become unpredictable,
ephemeral, and translucent, vanishing and reappearing without rhyme
or reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time Ning’s
swords and Winesage’s palms collided, the collision was very gentle
and soft. Both were using very soft, Yin-style attacks… but each
strike was filled with murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Shadowless
evasion art was born from his Shadowless stance. By now, his Omega
Sword Dao - Shadowless was able to make use of all types of energy.
It was skilled in energy redirection and completely unpredictable,
making it the most soft and Yin-style of attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were like a
pair of dancers. Each clash was whisper-soft and the movements were
gentle beyond compare, but both moved like incredibly fast blurs.
Winesage gave birth to countless fluctuating shadows while Ning would
occasionally disappear and then be forced to reappear due to the
Asura Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.” The
distant Palace Lord Dawnstar laughed. “Winesage has three killer
attacks; the [Extermination Palms], the [Asura Dance], and the
[Awakening Dream], with each attack being more deadly than the last.
Although the [Extermination Palms] are very dominating, they don’t
contain enough variability and flexibility. The [Asura Dance] and the
[Dreamwaker Finger] are more unpredictable… but Darknorth is an
extremely powerful Heartforce Cultivator. The Asura Domain is
virtually useless against him, making it so that the [Asura Dance]
isn’t able to reach its full potential as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Asura Dance] was
one of Winesage’s most powerful attacks. When he fought against
Dawnstar and the others, he would generally first unleash his
heartworld projection and his Asura Domain! When the Asura Domain was
used in combination with his [Asura Dance], his foes found it
extremely difficult to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he’ll
have to rely on the [Dreamwaker Finger].” Palace Lord Dawnstar
nodded. “Winesage relied on this stance to become acknowledged as
the number one Daolord of the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Much like how Daolord
Featherdress’ most powerful killer attack was the [Featherdress
Soulthrall Melody], Winesage’s most deadly attack was his
[Dreamwaker Finger]. Supposedly, it was a killer attack he suddenly
came up with after getting drunk and waking up the next morning. In
the face of this strike, even the likes of Palace Lord Dawnstar and
the Radiant King were defeated… and so, Winesage became the
undisputed number one Daolord of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Palace
Lord Dawnstar and the Radiant King both had terrifying killer attacks
of their own. The reason why Winesage was still able to beat them was
principally because they would be affected by his heartworld
projection and Asura Domain when they fought him! Even before the
battle had begun, they would already be reduced to 60% - 70% of their
true power. It was understandable for the two of them to lose to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why, from a
historical standpoint, the vast majority of number one Daolords were
Heartforce Cultivators! Even though foes might be able to endure
their heartforce illusions and other heartforce attacks, the foes
would still be weakened by the heartworld projection, which put the
two on uneven playing fields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Circular waves
rippled out from the surface of the water. Ning and Winesage had just
separated after another clash. Winesage stood there on the surface of
the water, a smile on his face. “Dawnstar and the Radiant King also
managed to just barely withstand my first two killer attacks. My
final attack is known as the [Dreamwaker Finger]. If you can
withstand it and remain undefeated, that means you are even stronger
than Dawnstar and the Radiant King. In that case, I’ll use my
Universe treasure to defeat you… but of course, if you fall to the
[Dreamwaker Finger], you won’t be worthy of seeing my Universe
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Dreamwaker
Finger]?” Ning said calmly, “I also have a killer attack that I
have yet to display. Let’s see whose is stronger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Technically speaking,
Ning’s three attacking stances (the Shadowless stance, the
Heavenbreaker stance, and the Blood Drop stance) were all on the same
level. However, his Northbow swords had evolved after absorbing the
golden sand from the cracked planetary core, causing the power of the
Blood Drop stance to increase fivefold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fivefold. What did that
mean? As a Daolord of the Second Step, Ning was able to transcend
space with ease. As a Daolord of the Third Step, he was similarly
able to break past the limit of a hundred times the speed of light
with ease. Even Daolord Shaka had been defeated in a single blow by
this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of the special
properties of the Northbow swords, the Blood Drop stance was Ning’s
most powerful attacking stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Winesage
began to move. “Then take my blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage was like a
giant roc who flew towards Ning at lightning speeds. His six hands
reached out like talons, each hand coming from a different direction!
This seemed like a very casual and gentle attack, but spacetime in
the local area began to tremble and shake. It must be remembered that
the Grand Waveshift Formation caused spacetime within the Waveshift
Realm to be extremely stable, preventing even spacetime techniques
from tearing the local spacetime apart. For Winesage’s supreme
attack to be able to affect spacetime locally was testament to its
tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the attack was
very light and soft, it seemed to summon all the might of the local
spacetime. Each of the six attacks contained an inconceivable amount
of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Extermination
Palms] and the [Asura Dance] both contained certain profound elements
of the Dao of Destruction, but the [Dreamwaker Finger] contained the
true essence and power of destruction within it. In the instant that
it touched the opponent, its full power would be instantaneously
unleashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao -
Blood Drop!” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately unleashing
his most powerful attack. His six Northbow swords all executed this
move, flying out like dazzling streaks of light! Every single streak
of light seemed to be capable of tearing through space and time,
causing spacetime in the area to tremble and shake. In the final
instant before contact, the tips of the six Northbow swords began to
spiral slightly. Boom! They instantly increased in speed, tearing
past a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Winesage’s
face changed. “He broke through the limit and struck faster than a
hundred times the speed of light. But Darknorth trains in the Dao of
the Sword! Since when was the Dao of the Sword capable of breaching
the limits on speed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
those who were able to breach that limit and move or strike faster
than a hundred times the speed of light actually trained in the Dao
of Light, such as the Radiant King or Daolord Shaka! This Dao was a
Dao of speed to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who trained in
the Dao of the Sword was able to breach this limit as well? This
forced Winesage to feel slightly anxious, but it was too late now.
There was no backing out of this attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six sword-tips
drilled straight towards the tips of Winesage’s six fingers. They
collided head-on! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying amount of
force was released on both ends, resulting in an unbelievable
explosion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WHAT?!” The
distant Palace Lord Dawnstar was so stunned his eyes bulged out.
“This is impossible!” He watched as Winesage was actually knocked
flying backwards, smashing into the surface of the river and causing
the surrounding water to disappear. As for Ning, he continued to
pursue Winesage with six Northbow swords in hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Dreamwaker
Finger] was actually defeated?” Palace Lord Dawnstar could hardly
believe it. “He lost in a frontal exchange?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Winesage didn’t
have that Universe treasure, Daolord Darknorth should be ranked as
the number one Daolord in the Endless Territories. Impressive, truly
impressive.” The two elders within the Dao Alliance’s Palace of
Immortals both sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve wandered
through many places and have seen many Daolords who have dazzled me.
Today, I’ve seen two more. The one named Darknorth… for him to
reach such a level despite merely having trained for less than a
hundred million years is simply incredible.” Both Hegemon Welkin
and the Brightshore Hegemon were watching this fight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage slammed into
the waters of the river, a look of disbelief on his face. “My
[Dreamwaker Finger] was actually defeated?” In the past, prior to
him acquiring the Universe treasure, he had reigned undefeated… but
today, his supreme technique had actually been defeated? And in a
head-on clash, no less. He truly was rendered speechless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His swords are not
only incredibly fast, they also contain incredible power.” Winesage
had a mixed look on his face. “When my life comes to an end, the
most powerful Daolord of this era shall be Darknorth.”

Chapter 26 - Eternal Emperor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had gained the upper
hand in a frontal clash, but Ji Ning wasn’t excited or smug about
it. This was because he knew that Winesage’s attacks were every bit
his equal in terms of profundity. He had an advantage in that his
Northbow swords made his Blood Drop stance fully five times more
powerful than normal. In the end, however, the Northbow swords were
not Universe treasures; they were simply ‘qualified’ to
potentially develop into Universe treasures in the future, and they
were exceptionally strong when executing the Blood Drop stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For him to win was
normal. If he had lost, he would’ve been shocked!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Winesage flew
back to the center of the river, returning to his normal two-armed
form. At the same time, a pair of black gloves appeared on his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
subconscious began to warn him of tremendous danger. He hurriedly
came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage slowly
levitated to stand above the water, a smile on his face. “I really
didn’t expect this. If it wasn’t for my Universe treasure, I
wouldn’t be able to keep safe my position atop the rankings.
Daolord Darknorth, I admire you very much. You truly are worthy of
forcing me to use my Universe treasure.” The black gloves in
Winesage’s hands began to emanate a terrifying aura of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he warily
eyed those black gloves. His Darknorth Swords were only strengthened
when using the Blood Drop stance; it didn’t strengthen his other
stances nearly as much. True Universe treasures, however, would allow
each and every stance to be filled with incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on.” Ning’s
eyes were filled with the desire to do battle. “I’ve heard long
ago that Universe treasures are very powerful, but I’ve never
tested one out for myself. Show me just how tough a Universe treasure
is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you wish.”
Winesage waved his right hand. Whoooosh. His black right glove swept
out, causing spacetime to shudder as darkness completely covered the
world around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
palm.” The distant Palace Lord Dawnstar was stunned. “I’ve
heard legends of Universe treasures for countless years, but this is
my first time actually seeing the power of one of them in person. In
the past, Winesage and I were on par with each other, but I’m now
no longer a match for him. The difference in power between us is
quite apparent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawnstar truly felt
powerless upon seeing this palm. His saber and his skills were
focused on attacking! He was supposedly the best close combat expert
in the Endless Territories, an offensive specialty… but when he saw
Winesage use his Universe treasure to execute the [Extermination
Palms], Dawnstar could sense that the power of this attack was far
more terrifying than his own. If he had been surpassed even in his
area of specialty, how could he not feel powerless?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” An illusory
figure suddenly appeared in the skies above the Waveshift Realm. It
was Realmsoul Polo. “Winesage has a Universe treasure! Although in
terms of enlightenment and understanding he remains inferior to the
eight lords of the Sacred Cities, in power alone he’s already
reached their level.” Polo had a somber look on his face as he
looked at that palm come crashing down. “Such incredible power…
it threatens the very stability of the Grand Waveshift Formation. Mm…
at least Winesage has the good sense not to cause disruption on a
large scale.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realmsoul Polo was in
charge of overseeing this entire realm. When Ning had used the
Hegemon Dao-seal, he had unleashed a level of power that surpassed
that of Winesage’s strike. Polo, however, hadn’t cared because
that Dao-seal was a single-use item. Winesage, however, would be able
to rely on his own power to unleash thousands of chops. If he wished
to cause wanton destruction, he could possibly disrupt the stability
of the entire formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he does disrupt
the formation, I’ll have no choice but to give him a little
warning,” Polo mused silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This strike was used
the same [Extermination Palms] technique as before. Ning already
understood the principles it operated off of, but the power had
increased to a completely different level. This was the level the
lords of the eight Sacred Cities had reached! Six Northbow swords in
his hands, Ning immediately executed the Omega Sword Dao - Soleheart
to defend. He wasn’t so arrogant as to try to take this attack
head-on! The difference in power was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning could feel a
terrifying amount of power explode against him. Although his Northbow
swords had already deflected much of the force, the remainder of it
had slammed into him, sending him flying backwards as the water
around him was completely annihilated. Ning continued to fly until he
slammed into the riverbed, the water around him completely
evaporated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning rose to
his feet, his face rather ashen. “What a terrifying strike. Thank
goodness I’ve reached the third stage of the Omega Sword Dao, and
have the Hegemon armor protecting me. Otherwise, I would’ve
suffered a heavy injury or even died!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the
‘surviving’ waters of the river came flooding into to replenish
the empty area around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t even
spit up blood?” The distant Winesage was shocked as well. Not only
had Darknorth survived, he hadn’t even been injured to the point of
vomiting blood?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, take a few more strikes from me!” Winesage continued to
press the attack. Boom! Boom! Boom! He used a series of palm-strikes,
fist-strikes, and finger-strikes against Ning. Ning was forced to
rely exclusively on defensive stances; given the overwhelming
disparity in power, he didn’t have any way to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was hit by one
attack after another. This was a crushing assault!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
defenses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s
defensive prowess equals his offensive prowess.” Palace Lord
Dawnstar sighed in amazement when he saw this. He was skilled in
offensive attacks, but his defensive techniques were much weaker than
Ning’s. “He should also have an incredible strong defensive
divine ability. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to take hits like
that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is what a
Universe treasure is like.” After fighting for a while, Ning felt
his entire body turn numb from pain. However, he now knew much more
about Universe treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Universe treasures
provided a tremendous boost in strength, but as with all sources of
external power it had its limits. Although Winesage had now reached
the level of the lords of the eight Sacred Cities in power, he would
definitely be at a disadvantage when fighting them. This was because
the eight lords were equal to him in power but superior to him in
profundity of technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In comparison to the
eight lords, the techniques which Winesage and Ning were using would
seem a bit clumsy. However, Winesage deserved to be proud; the eight
lords of the Sacred Cities stood at the true pinnacle of the Endless
Territories and were second only to the three Hegemons in power.
Given their status, they normally would never act against Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal Emperors
innately felt a sense of superiority when meeting Daolords, because
they knew that even the most supreme of Daolords would eventually die
if they failed their Daomerge. There was no way for them to live
longer than 108,000 chaos cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage, your
Universe treasure truly is formidable. I’m unable to resist its
power at all. Since I’ve experienced it for myself… it’s time
for me to say farewell,” Ning said loudly. A heartbeat later, he
vanished into thin air. The area around them was still covered by the
nine novessence arts as well as Ning’s heartworld projection, but
Ning himself had vanished. Winesage was completely unable to locate
him and thus didn’t even know what direction to pursue in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later, Ning
appeared more than a million kilometers away. “Winesage, farewell,”
Ning called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After him! Winesage
continued to pursue, unwilling to give up, but Ning was able to move
at a hundred times the speed of light, the same rate at which
Winesage himself flew when using his magic treasure. Given that the
two moved at the same speed, and given that Ning was able to use the
Shadowless evasion art to disappear at will, there was no way for
Winesage to catch up to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pursuit went on
for a full day. Winesage clearly had no chance at all, but he still
refused to give up. His situation was different from Ning’s. For
Ning, the 108,000 limit was something which incredibly far off in the
future, but for Winesage it felt imminent. He had already been alive
for more than 100,000 chaos cycles! This was why he so desperately
wanted the Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! As Ning was
flying past a series of snow-topped peaks, he suddenly felt an aura
of eternity manifest out of nowhere and cover the area around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This aura…?”
Both Ning and the pursuing Winesage were stunned. This aura was a
vast an ancient one that radiated eternity and immortality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… radiant,
incandescent light suddenly appeared above the Waveshift Realm. The
light appeared directly above Ning and slowly began to descend,
containing a degree of power that was simply inconceivable. Both Ning
and Winesage felt a sense of inexplicable terror; the aura of might
around this rainbow light surpassed even that of a Hegemon’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless streaks
of rainbow light began to circle around the region which Ning was in,
as that aura of supremacy descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning and Winesage exchanged a glance, both looking stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The prime essences
of the Daos of the universe have come to offer their
congratulations,” Ning murmured. “Yet another Daolord has
succeeded in his Daomerge to gain eternity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone succeeded in
the Daomerge and gained eternity?” The distant Winesage revealed a
look of disbelief. “Someone succeeded in the Daomerge? Yet another
Eternal Emperor has been born?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was an
incredible figure, his chances at the Daomerge remained incredibly
slim. When he saw the prime essences of the universe descend upon the
area in celebration, he understood that a new Eternal Emperor had to
have been born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daomerge gave
birth to a new Eternal Emperor!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone succeeded in
the Daomerge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who completed the
Daomerge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Daolords
of the Waveshift Realm watched as the dazzling rainbow light
descended, all of them stunned by that invincible, supreme aura that
came with it.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In every generation,
only a few Daolords will become Eternal Emperors,” Winesage mused.
“I never expected to see one right here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ji Ning
scanned the area as well.. “I wonder which Daolord made the
breakthrough. He’s probably hiding someone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The descent of the
prime essences of the universe covered the area around them, which
meant the new Eternal Emperor should be here as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The distant
Palace Lord Dawnstar flew over as well. He had been following them
this entire time, but now he finally revealed himself. He was dressed
in ordinary clothes and carried a great machete on his back. He was
the pride of the countless cultivators of the Brightshore Kingdom…
but of course, the Brightshore Kingdom now had another idol to be
proud of: Daolord Darknorth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dawnstar.” Ning
revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Palace
Lord Dawnstar smiled as well. “Haha. I didn’t have the chance to
congratulate you on how powerful you have become. After this matter
in the Waveshift Realm is concluded, we’ll be inducting you as the
new Palace Lord of the Palace of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The title of Palace
Lord of the Twelve Palaces was determined strictly based on power. By
now, Ning’s power had already outstripped that of any and all
Daolords in the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Brightshore
Kingdom is growing stronger and stronger. Both the second and third
positions belong to you,” the nearby Winesage said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you didn’t have
that Universe treasure, you might be thrown off your pedestal by
Darknorth,” Dawnstar said, then scanned the area. “Haha, I never
would’ve expected for a new Eternal Emperor to be born here in the
ninth layer of the Waveshift Realm. Every person in the ninth layer
is an extraordinary Daolord. This new Eternal Emperor will be a very
powerful one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. This Eternal
Emperor won’t be one of the ones who are killed with ease.”
Winesage nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords of the Fourth
Step were generally divided into four tiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lowest tier was the
‘ordinary’ tier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third-tier Daolords
included Daolords like like Patriarch Clearwind and Daolord Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second-tier
Daolords included the likes of Kongsan and Palace Lord Woodflower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme first-tier
Daolords included Winesage, Ning, Dawnstar, Ninedust, Snowjoy, and
the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords of the Fourth
Step who succeeded in the Daomerge and became Eternal Emperors would
also result in four different tiers of emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Eternal
Emperors were the weakest and were virtually unseen, primarily
because almost all of them had been wiped out. Alternately, they had
gone into hiding or had fled long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elite Eternal
Emperors included the likes of Emperor Mirrorsnow and Emperor Melobo.
Most of the living Eternal Emperors in the Endless Territories fell
into this category, and they were comparable to the supreme
first-tier Daolords in might. Most of them had been alive for
extremely long periods of time, and thus they had collected many
life-preserving items and techniques. To kill them was very, very
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next tier consisted
of the lords of the eight Sacred Cities and the likes of Patriarch
Vulturas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most supreme
Eternal Emperors were known as Hegemons. There were three of them in
the Endless Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one advantage
Eternal Emperors had was that of time. They were alive for so long
that they were able to accumulate many treasures. For Ning to face
off against the eight lords of the Sacred Cities was like a
second-tier Daolord facing off against a supreme Daolord! There was
an enormous difference in power, and that wasn’t even factoring in
the fact that the eight lords of the Sacred Cities were ancient
freaks who had acquired treasures similar to Hegemon Dao-seals. Most
likely, they all had many terrifying trump cards to use. There was
just no way to battle them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Winesage
scanned the area suspiciously. “Who is the Eternal Emperor? Why
hasn’t he come out yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it’s time for
him to come out.” Ning and Palace Lord Dawnstar scanned the area as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning’s face
turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Both
Dawnstar and Winesage noticed the change in Ning’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a complicated
look on his face. It was unclear if the expression was of joy or
rage. He waved his hand, causing two figures to appear atop the snowy
peaks. The first was that of Daolord Badlands. The other was that of
Daolord Solesky… or to be precise, Eternal Emperor Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Solesky,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Solesky
still looked as sloppy and disheveled as ever, but his aura was now
completely different. He had a stately, eternal majesty to him, as
his Dao had gained eternity. Emperor Solesky said hurriedly, “It’s
not what you think it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You used the Voidsea
Jadeseal?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I used it.”
Solesky nodded. “But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Used it?” Winesage
looked at Solesky, then interrupted him. “You are the former
Daolord Solesky, correct? I really didn’t expect this. Daolord
Darknorth and Daolord Ninedust risked their lives, so I felt certain
that one of them had the seal. In the end, it was with you all
along?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Solesky was
already famous for his invulnerable aquaform,” Palace Lord Dawnstar
said. “Now that he is an Eternal Emperor, his invulnerable aquaform
is assuredly even better than before. Most likely, it will be
extremely difficult for even the eight lords of the Sacred Cities to
kill him. As for us Daolords, we have no chance at all. Emperor
Solesky, congratulations. You have gained true eternity for
yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Solesky made
the breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s legendary for
being tough to get rid of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartforce
Cultivators all chatted mentally to each other, causing news to
quickly spread throughout not just the Waveshift Realm but the
entirety of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky. In the
past, many Daolords wished to capture him and learn more regarding
the Waveshift Realm from him. As a result, many knew of him! Although
his attacks were fairly weak, his defenses were incredibly strong,
allowing him to survive quite a few blows from even Fiendqueen
Dustrain. One could imagine how tough his defenses were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had become
an Eternal Emperor and his invulnerable aquaform had also reached the
eternal level, how much tougher would he have become?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many powerful Ancient
cultivators resided within a location inside the distant Terror
Starsea. The exact location of this Ancient homeland was a mystery,
with very few knowing the answer! Even the Ancient cultivators who
were granted entry didn’t know the exact location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An absolutely peerless
beauty was seated atop an ancient throne, a royal scepter in her
hands. To each side of her sat two rows of Ancients who were all
Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very center of
this room was a levitating image that displayed the scene within the
Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who would’ve
thought that Daolord Solesky would actually be the one to become an
Eternal Emperor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not that
strong, but he’s good at staying alive. In the future, we Ancient
cultivators will probably need to get along with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To succeed in the
Daomerge is far too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eternal Emperors of
the Ancient race all spoke out in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Hegemon
Netherlily, she said calmly from atop her high throne, “Emperor
Solesky’s emergence is a minor matter. He’s not that powerful,
and his existence has no impact on the situation in the Endless
Territories at all! The Waveshift Realm… I can vaguely sense that
something ten thousand times greater than the emergence of Emperor
Solesky is going to happen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greater?” The
Ancient cultivator Eternal Emperors were all rather surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are too weak.
You won’t be able to sense it,” Hegemon Netherlily said. “The
secrets held within the Waveshift Realm are absolutely extraordinary.
This is why I’ve been using my attunement to karma to keep an eye
on everything happening within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The existence of the
Grand Waveshift Formation prevented the other Eternal Emperors from
being able to scry the realm in detail, but Hegemon Netherlily was
able to accomplish it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And of course, Hegemon
Windrain and Hegemon Brightshore were able to do the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Windrain
Kingdom, the most sacred place of the Aberrant lifeforms, gentle rain
fell down from the skies. This truly was a world of wind and rain,
and it was filled with creeks, valleys, and beautiful rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” An enormous
face appeared in the midst of a vast forest filled with countless
trees. It was a special lifeform that was so incredibly vast, its
body spanned the majority of the Windrain Kingdom. An image suddenly
appeared in the air in front of the face. This was an image of what
was happening within the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new Eternal
Emperor was born? Daolord Solesky might’ve broken through to become
an Eternal Emperor, but this won’t have an impact on the Endless
Territories as a whole, much less cause me to sense something.”
Hegemon Windrain continued to watch from afar. “Waveshift… what
the hell was he planning? What secrets are hidden within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance’s
roots and foundation were incredibly deep, and its two leaders had a
very wide web of influence. Despite that, they weren’t even close
to living as relaxed a life as Emperor Waveshift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Windrain,
Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Netherlily… they were far more
powerful than Emperor Waveshift, but for them to go from place to
place through the Great Dark was extremely difficult for them,
whereas Emperor Waveshift was able to accomplish it with ease. It
could be said that the most influential Eternal Emperor to ever leave
the Endless Territories was Emperor Waveshift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift Realm.”
Hegemon Welkin had been slumbering in the Endless Territories for
many years in an effort tto heal his wounds. Both he and Hegemon
Brightshore were paying close attention to the Waveshift Realm as
well. Both of them could also vaguely sense that something big was
going to happen there, something which would have an important impact
on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three native
Hegemons of the Endless Territories and the outsider Hegemon Welkin,
as well as the most powerful and ancient Eternal Emperors, were all
able to sense that something was going to happen. This was why they
were so focused on the Waveshift Realm.

Chapter 28 - Crimsonwave Temple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite the relative
indifference of the Hegemons, Ji Ning and the other Daolords were
paying rapt attention to the fact that Daolord Solesky had succeeded
in his Daomerge and become an Eternal Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True eternity.”
Ning looked at Emperor Solesky, a complicated feeling in his heart.
If it hadn’t been for happened to Ninedust, Ning would be
celebrating… but instead he was trying to keep a tight lid on his
temper and prevent it from exploding. His big brother Solesky really
had used up the Voidsea Jadeseal and let him and Ninedust protect him
like idiots! For Ning to do this was one thing, but Ninedust didn’t
have much of a relationship with Solesky; wouldn’t Solesky be
ashamed if he allowed Ninedust to die on his behalf in the outside
world? They had already agreed to hand over the Voidsea Jadeseal if
they were unable to continue the fight. So what the hell happened?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had wanted to ask
this question for quite some time now, but for the sake of the
Daomerge Solesky had completely entered a state of secluded
meditation. Even his avatar had gone into seclusion, completely
absorbed with the Daomerge. There had been no chance to speak to him
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Emperor Solesky wanted to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage barked,
“Emperor Solesky, when you claim you used up the Voidsea Jadeseal,
are you perhaps trying to help Darknorth and Ninedust out?” He did
indeed find this rather suspicious. As he saw it, both Ning and
Ninedust were much stronger than Daolord Solesky had been. How could
Solesky be the one to end up using it, while Ning and Ninedust risked
their lives to defend him? What would be the point? Was it possible
that Emperor Solesky was lying in an attempt to deceive them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really did use it
up,” Emperor Solesky said hurriedly. “I’m not helping them out.
They were helping me out! I swear on my very life itself that I’ve
already used up the Voidsea Jadeseal and in the process completed the
Daomerge. If anything I just said was false, let my soul be shattered
and my truesoul forever dissipate!” Emperor Solesky said in a loud
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage shook his
head. Given that Solesky had just sworn a lifeblood oath, there was
no way he was lying. “Alas… all that for nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least there are
three more remaining,” Palace Lord Dawnstar said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a series of
figures began to appear in midair. All of the Daolord squads
throughout the Waveshift Realm were able to see a version of this
white-robed man appear before them! It was Realmsoul Polo once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realmsoul Polo stared
downwards, his gaze focusing on Emperor Solesky. “Emperor Solesky,
my master has decreed that Eternal Emperors are forbidden from
breaching the Grand Waveshift Formation and entering this realm!
However, since you were originally just a Daolord when you entered,
your presence here will not be ruled a violation of the rules. Still,
you must immediately depart from the Waveshift Realm. I’ll open up
a corridor for you to leave through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul Polo,
please give me half a day first.” Emperor Solesky lifted his head
and said in a clear voice, “I definitely will not damage any of the
formations within the Waveshift Realm.” He knew that he had to give
Ning a satisfactory explanation. Otherwise… although they wouldn’t
go from being brothers to being mortal enemies, the relationship
between the two of them would be dramatically impacted by today’s
events.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, but only half
a day.” Polo agreed to his request.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
Daolords in the Waveshift Realm, and virtually all of them were
Verge-level Daolords. For them to attempt the Daomerge here was
reasonable. If an Eternal Emperor from the outside world dared to
enter by force, Realmsoul Polo definitely would’ve launched a
counterstrike! His master, Emperor Waveshift, had left quite a few
tricks and traps behind. However, if a Daolord within the realm
actually made a breakthrough, Polo would simply congratulate them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Solesky used
up the Voidsea Jadeseal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not Daolord Solesky;
he’s now Emperor Solesky!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust and
Darknorth fought all that time just for his sake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Daolords in
the realm were all rather speechless. Both Darknorth and Ninedust
were supreme Daolords who had beaten back one squad after another of
Daolords. Even Sectlord Timedream and the Kingfreak had died! The
many Daolords in the Waveshift Realm would’ve accepted either of
them acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseal, but who would’ve thought that
it would be Daolord Solesky who would end up with it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Solesky
really is a lucky man, for him to have become lifelong friends with
Daolord Darknorth early on. This time, it was Daolord Darknorth who
helped him acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His lucky truly was
incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords all sighed
in amazement and envy. Given how strong Daolord Solesky had been, as
an Eternal Emperor he would no doubt be able to live an extremely
long life. There were no Daolords, at least, capable of posing a
threat to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the airborne
Realmsoul Polo finished speaking with Emperor Solesky, the realmsoul
continued, “The competition over the first two Voidsea Jadeseals
has come to an end. Now, it is time for the final three seals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Daolords
within the Waveshift Realm all listened intently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final three
seals are all located within the tenth layer of the Waveshift Realm.”
Realmsoul Polo stared downwards at the Daolords. “I believe that
thus far, none of you have managed to reach the tenth layer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Daolords all nodded. The Waveshift Realm had a total of ten layers,
something which Emperor Waveshift had made known back when he was
still around here. However, thus far no one had been able to enter
the tenth layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tenth layer is
over there.” Realmsoul Polo pointed towards a certain direction off
in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A distant mountain
range began to shake and rumble, then split apart as an enormous
edifice began to emerge from deep within it. A terrifying, awesome
aura of power emanated from this enormous building, with the aura
being so strong that every single Daolord within the Waveshift Realm
was able to sense it clearly. Even those who were very far away from
it and were unable to see it clearly due to many different formations
blocking their vision were able to sense it. It was like a
terrifying, slumbering beast that was slowly waking up and making its
presence felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying.”
For now, Ning didn’t pay his big brother Solesky any heed as he
focused on attuning to that distant, incredible, terrifying aura of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The airborne Realmsoul
Polo also stared off into the distance, watching as the enormous
thing slowly rose. Finally, it made itself fully visible. It was an
ancient temple that was a mixture of black and gold, and anyone who
looked at it would sense its incredible age.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tenth layer is
actually that ancient temple over there!” Realmsoul Polo said.
“This temple is known as the Crimsonwave Temple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tenth layer is
the Crimsonwave Temple, and all three of the Voidsea Jadeseals are
located within it,” Realmsoul Polo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore and
Hegemon Welkin had been seated, but they now both shot to their feet
in astonishment, staring at the enormous image in front of them and
the scene of the ancient temple’s emergence. The temple had three
ancient characters written directly above it. The characters were
extremely complicated, much like the Dreamdust language and the
azureflower seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the three
characters, they stood for: ‘Crimson’ ‘Wave’ and ‘Temple’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonwave Temple?”
Hegemon Brightshore and Hegemon Welkin shared a glance, stunned looks
in both of their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary
Crimsonwave Temple?” Hegemon Welkin murmured softly, “The
legendary Crimsonwave Temple has actually appeared within your
realmverse… how did Emperor Waveshift manage to move the
Crimsonwave Temple into his Waveshift realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it really the
Crimsonwave Temple?” Hegemon Brightshore was stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the
Crimsonwave Temple!” Hegemon Netherlily shot to her feet from her
throne, two blurry streams of light emanating from her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonwave Temple?”
The ancient Eternal Emperors all had puzzled looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s a
Crimsonwave Temple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, what is
this Crimsonwave Temple of which you speak?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
puzzled. Hegemon Netherlily, however, just stared at the ancient
temple as she murmured softly, “Myself, Brightshore, Windrain…
all of our treasures combined are not worth as much as Crimsonwave
Temple. Emperor Waveshift… you truly are incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary
Crimsonwave Temple?” The enormous face within the vast forest of
countless trees revealed a stunned look as well. “The Crimsonwave
Temple was actually relocated into our realmverse, the Endless
Territories?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive
abilities. Simply impressive!” The gold-furred alien and the
black-robed, black-haired elder within the Dao Alliance were shocked
as well. They stared at the levitating mirror in front of them and at
the image of that ancient temple within the mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When did that brat
Waveshift manage to relocate the Crimsonwave Temple into his little
world, and without anyone noticing to boot?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t
because he voluntarily exposed it, none of us would know a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must’ve cost
him a fortune.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Waveshift Realm
itself, Ning and the other countless Daolords simply stared
expectantly as the tenth layer, the ‘Crimsonwave Temple’, made
its appearance. They were eagerly focused on the three final Voidsea
Jadeseals, and they didn’t really know what the name ‘Crimsonwave
Temple’ represented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master has
wandered the endless Great Dark. Crimsonwave Temple was the greatest
treasure my master has ever gained, after experiencing countless
dangers and travails.” Realmsoul Polo stared downwards, his voice
echoing throughout the Waveshift Realm. “The Endless Territories is
my master’s homeland and thus he sent Crimsonwave Temple here as an
offering to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realmsoul Polo was
extremely proud. These words were meant to be heard by the
highest-level members of the six powers. Indeed, Emperor Waveshift
had offered his greatest treasure, ‘Crimsonwave Temple’, to the
Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final three
Voidsea Jadeseals are located within the Crimsonwave Temple. Only
supreme Daolords will stand a chance at surviving it.” Realmsoul
Polo looked downwards at the countless Daolords, a hint of a smile on
his face.
