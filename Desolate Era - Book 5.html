Chapter 1 - Kill! Kill! Kill!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He cannot be
permitted to leave this place alive!” Those six lavishly dressed
men and women began to shout as well. They knew very that with their
formation broken and with the protective, hiding shroud which it had
given them gone, they would quickly be discovered…and once Ji Ning
escaped, the news would quickly spread and they would immediately be
found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to capture
back the formation flag to this bewildering formation! Ji Ning had to
be executed as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!” A large
number of servants charged wildly towards Ji Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately stored
the formation flag into his storage-type magic treasure, while at the
same time, the wing-type magic treasures on his back immediately
activated as he rushed outwards. At the same time, a boundless amount
of scorching fire immediately descended, which surrounded those
servants and began to burn them, causing the servants to all scream
in agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Three figures from within the group of servants came pouncing out
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian lifeforms?”
Ning immediately recognized that all three of them were Xiantian
lifeforms. “It seems this despicable Immortal practitioner has
quite a few Xiantian lifeforms under his control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Master has given
the order to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three Xiantian
lifeforms were filled with murderous intent. They were all servants
of Bei Zishan who were controlled through poisons. They didn’t dare
to disobey the orders of Bei Zishan’s orders. Immediately, they
transformed into rays of light, streaking from different directions
to attack Ning, but Ning simply used his Windwing Evasion technique
to move forward and directly clash with one of them, a fat-headed,
big-eared, bearded man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raaaawr!” The big
fellow was wielding a large hammer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword light flashed,
and the big fellow rolled to the ground, falling down while clutching
his chest, blood staining the ground. In but a single exchange,
Ning’s sword had pierced through his heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little baby.” A
hawk-nosed man roared angrily as he charged forward, and as he did, a
flash of sword light chopped half his head off, and he died on the
spot. The third Xiantian lifeform, an older man, was so terrified,
his face changed and he immediately retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boundless amounts of
flame descended, and two Xiantian lifeforms had been killed in an
instant as well. The third had been so terrified, he had immediately
retreated. This caused those six men and women to stare at each
other, the looks on their faces unpleasant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
speed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His swordplay is far
superior to any of us. No wonder he was able to kill our senior
fellow apprentice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them understand
that even if they all charged together, the result would most likely
be that single same word; ‘death’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning was
like a life-taking god of death. On one side, boundless amounts of
fire scorched those servants, while on his side, he had slaughtered
those Xiantian lifeforms. All together, the servants, spirit-beasts,
and disciples of Bei Zishan totaled more than ten Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flood Dragon
Dao-Soldiers!” The youngest of the six, that handsome youth,
suddenly let out a fierce howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flood Dragon
Dao-Soldiers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five fellow
apprentices immediately understood. All of them shouted furiously,
while at the same time, their bodies quickly became covered with a
layer of black armor. The six of them were now all garbed in the same
black armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” For a
moment, the entire mountain seemed to tremble. This great mountain
had actually been hollowed out long ago. Aside from the primary place
midway up the mountain, there had been a large number of smaller
caverns dug out as well. After all, more than a million commoners
were being tortured here. From this number, one could imagine how
many caves had been created to hold them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Like raindrops falling from the skies in a
dense cluster, from each mountain cave flew out one deep green
armored Dao-Soldier after another. Each Dao-Soldier was covered with
complicated, ancient runes which drew upon the energy of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Soldiers!”
Ning’s face changed. He watched as from afar, a large number of
soldiers emerged from the hundreds of caves in the mountain. He
immediately recognized them for Dao-Soldiers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, these
are even more powerful Dao-Soldiers than the ‘Crimson Guard’ of
my Ji clan.” Given his experience, Ning naturally could sense the
power of those runes on these Dao-Soldier’s armor, causing him to
be all the more surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than ten thousand
Dao-Soldiers descended from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And there were more
than ten black armored Xiantian lifeform Dao-Soldiers as well, all
charging forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill. Kill as many
as I can.” Ning understood that he definitely couldn’t let them
join forces. He immediately swept out with his wings, moving like a
giant Roc towards a location a kilometer away. These Dao-Soldiers
were virtually all at the Houtian level, and thus were much faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, his face
spotted red thanks to the poison, had gone completely insane. In an
instant, an enormous amount of celestial fire and boundless amounts
of freezing frost descended from the skies, wildly sweeping out in
each direction. Ning was currently exhausting all of his power to
control water and fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the more than ten
thousand Dao-Soldiers, every nine of them linked up, summoning forth
the power of the natural world. Faintly, behind their bodies, the
illusion of a dragon appeared. Faced with the attack of that
scorching flame and freezing frost, most of those who had linked up
just barely managed to withstand the attack, while those who had not
instantly lost their lives, especially those who were at the center
of the flames and of the frost. The surges of heat and cold
intersected, causing even those who had linked up to lose their
lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Flood Dragon
Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten-plus
black-armored Xiantian lifeforms wanted to charge together in
formation as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” In the
Aquatic Manor, Ning had seen nine Xiantian lifeforms using
Dao-Soldier armors. How could he just stand by idly and permit these
ten or so people to do as they pleased?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus,
grind them all to death!” In an instant, Ning formed nine
Waterflame Lotuses, surrounding nine of those people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Waterflame
Lotuses appeared out of nowhere, each with one petal of fire and one
petal of water, one above and one below, and they ground down at
their targets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaah!” The woman
with the viper on her shoulder let out a shrill scry, and was killed,
ground into fine pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all of them
wanted to assemble the formation, of the nine people covered by
Waterflame Lotuses, six of them had already died while three were
heavily injured. This caused the remaining Xiantian lifeforms to all
be shocked…this sort of ability was simply too terrifying. At such
a great distance, this man was capable of simultaneously killing six
Xiantian lifeforms? Generally speaking, Xiantian lifeforms weren’t
capable of long-distance attacks, because they were unable to ride on
magic treasures to engage in distant attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six dead people
were quite unfortunate; they weren’t afraid of the fire and water
which Ning was capable of controlling, but they hadn’t expected
that Ning would execute this ‘Waterflame Lotus’, which contained
a hint of the True Meaning of the Dao. If they had known in advance,
they would have all immediately prepared protective Dao-seals, and
thus wouldn’t have instantly lost their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” The handsome youth’s black armor immediately began to
glow with runes, while at the same time those runes which appeared
connected with the illusory dragons behind the many ordinary
Dao-Soldiers, connecting together into a large whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
the handsome youth connected with a thousand of the ordinary
Dao-Soldiers, and behind him appeared the illusion of a Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Xiantian lifeform
after another immediately began to link together with the
Dao-soldiers. Some activated a thousand, while others activated five
hundred. Although the maximum was a thousand Dao-Soldiers, Ning had
killed simply too many of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, too
many Dao-Soldiers have died, and we don’t even have nine thousand.
Otherwise, once we combined to form the entire Flood Dragon, we could
effortlessly kill him.” One illusory Flood Dragon after another
appeared in mid-air, resulting in a total of eight illusory Flood
Dragons, which were controlled and formed by those eight Xiantian
lifeforms and thousands of Dao-Soldiers joining formings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But even though we
aren’t able to transform into a greater Flood Dragon, he will still
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
mountain, in that private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green flame
continued to flicker in the middle of that ancient, unadorned
cauldron. The blood red banner was currently hovering there, as a
large number of dread wraiths were howling silently, wildly
attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bei Zishan was seated
in the lotus position, his face incomparably sinister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person named Ji
Ning was actually able to break my grand formation.” Zishan was
both frantic and angry. He himself had been, this entire time,
hiding, fleeing, and trying to refine this powerful magic treasure
and thus suddenly rise in power. But without this great formation
hiding him, there was no way for him to hide at all. In addition,
there were still many dread wraiths that had yet to be absorbed.
Right now, what he was trying to do was forcibly bring the process to
a halt, as he would rather give up the many dread wraiths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this sort of
incomparably sinful magic treasure was also incomparably dangerous to
make. If he wasn’t careful, he would be devoured by it instead. He
had to be extremely careful and cautious, even in an attempt to
stop…he still had to kill each and every single one of those dread
wraiths who had yet to be refined before he could be killed. If he
tried to do it forcibly, he himself would be devoured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To come to a halt
needed time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, there are
less than nine thousand Dao-Soldiers.” From within the mountain, a
spirit-beast who had transformed into a human male’s form called
out frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Bei Zishan,
currently forcibly repressing his agitation, upon hearing the words
from his spirit-beast, immediately grew frantic. “Less than nine
thousand Dao-Soldiers? With less than nine thousand, there’s no way
to transform into a giant Flood Dragon. Given the power of this Ning,
he can absolutely flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
the blood-red banner suddenly began to shake, as countless dread
wraiths wildly attempted to break free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bei Zishan forced
himself to calm down. He knew that as soon as he lost his grip, those
dread wraiths would throw themselves upon him, and he would probably
die here today. Bei Zishan immediately made a small bag appear in his
hand, which appeared similar to a brocade purse. From within the
little purse, a black coffin appeared out of nowhere, which with a
thud landed against the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The coffin immediately
opened, and a heart-trembling aura emanated forth. A large paw,
covered with black fur, grabbed the sides of the coffin, and then sat
up. This was a black-furred zombie which had glowing green eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred zombie
landed on the ground, its body surrounded by a black energy that was
visible to the naked eye. The black energy was a necromantic aura,
and if a Xiantian lifeform were to absorb it, that person would
definitely be poisoned to death. This zombie…was one of the final
trump cards which Bei Zishan had. He had worked hard to create it
from the corpse of a Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. Kill him.”
Zishan gave the order. Zombies were neither living nor dead. The
black-furred zombie was at the level where it had a certain degree of
intelligence. It could recognize the disciples of Zishan, and it
could also quickly recognize situations as well as whom its enemies
were. This black-furred zombie was already comparable to a Zifu
Disciple, and it was extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Umm.” The
black-furred zombie let out a low grunt, then walked out, then with a
single leap, jumped out from the nearly 150 meter deep tunnel.”

Chapter 2 - Lesser Thousand Sword Formation, Kill!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Firebird and
the black serpent were currently high in the air, waiting
impatiently. They were under orders to locate Ji Ning, but
previously, the black serpent had already shouted three times,
without any response at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that the
young master isn’t here?” The black serpent said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Black, look
below.” The Azure Firebird spoke in the human tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black serpent
looked downwards, only to see that on the formerly calm mountain, a
large number of armored Dao-Soldiers had appeared, surrounded by
frost and with fires blazing…those Dao-Soldiers and Xiantian
lifeforms had forcibly formed into eight illusory Flood Dragons, and
the power emanating from those illusory Flood Dragons caused even the
Azure Firebird and the black serpent in the air to feel shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Soldiers…thousands
of them that can join together?” The Azure Firebird and the black
serpent were shocked. The various local hegemons of Swallow Mountain
weren’t capable of such things. Only the Grand Xia Dynasty’s
soldiers that were stationed at Southmont City were capable of this.
“Such power…even if the two of us were to go attack, we’d
probably be easily annihilated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, young master
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of these
thousands of Dao-Soldiers, appeared a beast-clad youth who was
emanating an aura of incomparable wildness and savagery. It was Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning! How can he possibly oppose thousands of joined Dao-Soldiers?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, quick,
flee!” The black serpent shouted frantically in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those Xiantian
lifeforms bound against the pillars within the mountain stared
towards the outside nervously as well. Outside, the boundless amounts
of flame and frost that had appeared caused them to be shocked as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, that Zifu Disciple is currently refining that evil magic
treasure. For now, he can’t be distracted. Quick, flee!”
Blindfish howled frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, quick,
leave! If you dawdle, it’ll be too late!” Ji Jadewich roared as
well, his throat going hoarse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Xiantian
lifeforms of the Ji clan were shouting frantically. They had been
bound here for so long, and often heard the conversation of those
people, and saw some dread wraiths enter the depths of the
mountain…they knew that there was a Zifu Disciple here refining an
incomparably vile magic treasure. Once this person completed it and
personally attacked, what would the repercussions be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Thousands of
linked Dao-Soldiers?” The group of bound Xiantian lifeforms
suddenly saw that those many Dao-Soldiers who were being burnt by
fire or frozen by frost suddenly formed into multiple illusory Flood
Dragons. They were only able to see a small portion, but this was
already enough to shock them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, leave now!”
All of them were incomparably frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing the frantic
shouts from his Uncle Black from the skies, as well as the voices of
his Master Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, Poortile, Ji Shan, and the others
who were bound deeper in the mountain, how could Ji Ning, already
poisoned, not go even wilder? Flee? Why would he flee? Even if he
fled, he would unquestionably die. If he could risk his life to kill
that Zifu Disciple, he might instead have a chance at life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning saw
the thousands of Dao-Soldiers in front of him. Not hesitating at all,
he released his most powerful killing blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than three hundred
sword-type magic treasures appeared out of nowhere around Ning, every
single sword glowing dimly with white light, while at same time
activating the power of the natural world. Ning had already reached a
very high level of attainment in formations, and so his ability to
execute the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had clearly improved
greatly as well. It wasn’t like in the past, where he controlled it
by rote and by memory; he now understood some of the mysteries
inherent within, and knew how to guide them more effectively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are those?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can swords fly
like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flying magic
treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Xiantian
lifeforms amongst those thousands of Dao-Soldiers were completely
stunned. Seeing the hundreds of flying swords all hovering there,
they instantly thought of something…Zifu Disciple! One had to at
least be a Zifu Disciple in order to control magic treasures and fly
on them. This was all but common knowledge. But now, this youth was
actually flying on magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could they have
imagined that Ning’s soul had already reached the level of ‘divine
will’, which was why he was able to accomplish this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a Zifu
Disicple, Master, he’s a Zifu Disciple. That youth is a Zifu
Disicple!” Some of the Xiantian lifeforms in the Dao Battle-Armor
were already beginning to cry out desolately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” Ning
instantly controlled that pulsating, glowing sword in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That pulsating sword
light immediately slashed out in an incomparably beautiful arc,
leaving behind a desolate, beautiful line in the air. It easily
chopped through that handsome youth’s chest, and the handsome youth
stared, wide-eyed, in disbelief. “Zifu…Zifu…” Even in death,
he couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” The tall,
muscular fellow just began to cry out, but before he finished it, he
was pierced through by the sword glow as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their Dao-Soldier
formation hadn’t truly formed into a Flood Dragon, after all; they
had only formed eight illusory Floor Dragons. Every single illusory
Flood Dragon was formed from a single Xiantian lifeform Dao-Soldier
and hundreds or a thousand Houtian Dao-Soldiers. In terms of defense
alone, they were actually inferior to the combined forces of the nine
Xiantian Dao-Soldiers of the second trial of the Aquatic Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was naturally
capable of winning through close combat and using the True Meaning of
the Raindrop, but doing so would be very tiring, and he would have to
face a group attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on this
level four [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], he was able to bring
forth the power of an early Zifu Disciple using a ranked magic
treasure. Even if the enemy truly had nine thousand Dao-Soldiers and
nine Xiantian lifeforms and was capable of forming into a true Flood
Dragon, Ning would still be able to fight. And now, when the enemy
was like a platter of loose sand, unshaped and unformed, he naturally
chopped through them as easily as chopping through vegetables.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zifu Disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a Zifu
Disicple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light slashed
out in another graceful arc, piercing through those eight Xiantian
Dao-Soldiers in sucession. No matter how those Xiantian Dao-Soldiers
attempted to flee, their speed was incomparably slower than the speed
of that sword light. Even though the nearby Houtian Dao-Soldiers all
tried to help block, those Houtian Dao-Soldiers were simply executed
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Zifu Disicple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zifu Disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One desolate scream
after another shook the entire mountain. These Xiantian Dao-Soldiers
were filled to the brim with unwillingness to accept this. They
hadn’t imagined that this youth named Ji Ning was actually a Zifu
Disciple! Ordering them to battle against a Zifu Disciple? They
weren’t able to accept that this was how they would die. If they
had known, they wouldn’t have come out at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In mid-air, the Azure
Firebird and the black serpent watched with wide eyes, their mouths
hanging open. From below, Ning was controlling hundreds of swords
which were hovering in the air, and then formed into a single sword
light which was dominating everyone and everything. This was power on
a completely different level. Much like how Xiantian lifeforms could
massacre Houtian experts, that sword light effortlessly executed
those eight Xiantian Dao-Soldiers, and with their deaths, those
Houtian Dao-Soldiers naturally were unable to maintain their grand
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, he…he’s a
Zifu Disciple?” The black serpent, who had watched Ning grow up
since he was a child, was somewhat stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Blindfish,
Jadewich, Shan, and the others trapped within the mountain who had
been frantically calling for Ning to flee were stunned. From this
angle, they couldn’t see Ning, but through the cave entrance, they
were able to see many Dao-Soldiers. They personally saw those
Dao-Soldiers dressed in black armor, which was to say the Xiantian
Dao-Soldiers, be easily pierced through one by one by an incomparably
brilliant sword light. All of those Xiantian Dao-Soldiers collapsed,
dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, as they
died, all of them were howling with grief and rage, “Zifu
Disciple!” “A Zifu Disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Zifu Disciple?”
Blindfish and the others, including the other pitiable Xiantian
lifeforms from the other powers here at the Swallow Mountain region,
were all somewhat numb. Could it be that aside from Ning, there was
another Zifu Disciple who was attacking?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black shadow suddenly
leapt out from the already opened entrance to that dark underground
cave. His green pupils swept those Xiantian lifeforms who were bound
within this cave. There were still some ordinary servants here who
hadn’t joined the battle. Two unlucky bastards, because they had
been fairly close to the cave entrance, had their bodies immediately
invaded by the black necromantic energy swirling around the
black-furred zombie when it appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!” The two
unlucky bastards hadn’t been able to become Dao-Soldiers.
Naturally, they were quite ordinary in ability. As soon as the
necromantic aura invaded their bodies, they let out desolate howls,
then quickly dissolved into puddles of liquid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred zombie
had already, with a single step, moved past the cave entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, be
careful!” Blindfish howled frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, after seeing that
the Xiantian Dao-Soldiers had been executed, retrieved his three
hundred plus swords. After all, he was still just an early stage
Xiantian lifeform. The Xiantian ki in his body wasn’t dense enough!
If he were to control thousands of swords, his ki would probably be
used up in a single attack. If he just used these three hundred or
so, he was still only able to execute it ten times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true opponent was
that truly terrifying Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaar.” An
angry roar rang out, and from the distance, a black shadow flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the Zifu
Disciple?” Ning’s wing-type magic treasure trembled, and he
immediately flew out in an arc, putting some distance between them.
With a smashing sound, that black shadow smashed into the ground,
causing a massive, thirty meter wide crater to appear on the ground.
When Ning saw this, the look on his face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred zombie
stared at Ning, that black, fog-like necromantic aura swirling around
his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This fellow is so
strong, and his speed is very fast.” Ning was still stunned, and he
even was reminded of that black-furred aberration who had served as
the third trial in the Aquatic Manor. However, this black-furred
zombie gave Ning an evil, baleful feeling, and had that black fog
swirling around his body. That aberration who served as the third
trial in the Aquatic Manor didn’t.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The
black-furred zombie stared at Ning, then charged towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Activating the wing-type magic treasures, Ning moved like a ghost,
constantly dodging. Although each time he dodged, it was rather
difficult, he was still able to evade. Occasionally, the Darknorth
swords in his hands would land blows on the black-furred zombie, but
only white smudges were left on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This fellow seems
quite similar to the black-furred aberration in the Aquatic Manor.
His strength is great, his speed is fast, and his body is
incomparably tough. However, his strength is much lower.” In their
exchange of blows, Ning immediately discovered that the black-furred
zombie’s method of using force was very clumsy, while the
black-furred creature in the underwater estate has intelligence. In
terms of both footwork and palm techniques, although each movement
seemed simple, even with Ning’s miraculous evasion techniques, he
still couldn’t dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even at the
advanced level of technique. Definitely not a Zifu Disciple. The
antidote to my poison is probably being carried by that Zifu
Disciple. He hasn’t come out, which means he definitely isn’t
able to be distracted right now. I have to seize the opportunity to
get rid of him.” Ning understood that for the Zifu Disciple to
still not come out meant the man was definitely in a tough situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While he was ill, go
for the kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wing-type magic
treasures on Ning’s back trembled, then took him in an arcing line,
moving past the black-furred zombie. The zombie howled ferociously,
wanting to attack Ning, but how could Ning, when using the [Windwing
Evasion], be caught by the likes of him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” A
sinister, cold, sharp voice suddenly emanated out from the mountain.
Ning immediately saw that midway in the mountain, at the ground in
front of the cavern entrance, there was a man dressed in a loose
black robe. This man’s hair was loosely bound, and his face was
utterly ashen, without a hint of color. The oily green eyes the man
had caused even greater shock to Ning than the black-furred zombie
had.

Chapter 3 - A Battle to the Death!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bei Zishan swept the
surrounding area with his gaze. He saw the areas frozen by frost or
scorched by flames and those many corpses. In particular, when he
saw, amongst the corpses, the bodies of those Xiantian lifeform
Dao-Soldiers, Zishan’s heart clenched. He ached! These were his
subordinates. For forging and refining this sort of sinful magic
treasure, he needed many subordinates to torment and torture people,
and also some powerful subordinates to capture Xiantian lifeforms for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All ruined.”
Zishan looked towards Ji Ning, his gaze filled with a sinister
maliciousness. “My students and servants were all wiped out by you.
Those potential dread wraiths that I had been cultivating and
refining for so long, and was about to finish with…you forced me to
stop. I, Bei Zishan, was actually by a little child like you to
suffer such a loss! I won’t mistreat you. In fact, I will have to
‘thank’ you and let you have a taste of what it is like to have
your soul be tormented!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zifu Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a Zifu
Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amidst the thousands of
Dao-Soldiers, there were still quite a few screaming in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are a Zifu
Disciple?” Bei Zishan stared at Ning. After all, his evil magic
treasure was only half completed because of Ning’s interruption.
However, even with this half-completed magic treasure, Zishan could
be considered a peak Zifu figure. Based on the discussion between his
disciples, however, this Ning was just a twelve year old youth of the
Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A twelve year old who
had become a Zifu Disciple?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this was true! Then
Zishan was actually worried. For someone so young to have become a
Zifu Disciple most likely meant that this person had some miraculous
events occur. Perhaps he might have some sort of hidden, secret
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zifu Disciple? If I
said I wasn’t a Zifu Disciple, would you believe me?” Ning said
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zishan had been just
standing there, but suddenly, a boat appeared beneath his legs.
Stepping onto the boat, Zishan instantly began to pull away from
Ning. Zishan, dressed in his long black robed, stared coldly at Ning.
He had already decided to consider that Ning was an expert on the
same level as him, and so he immediately pulled away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal practitioners
came in all types. Fiendgod Body Refiners preferred close combat,
while others who liked to use magic treasures, poisons, golems, and
more would naturally prefer to pull to a distance before using their
techniques. After all, close quarters combat was very dangerous. Bei
Zishan, for example, liked to use poisons and magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!” A black
claw suddenly appeared, sweeping forwards and attacking Ning from
behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s wing-type
magic treasure trembled, and he flew out in an arc, immediately
dodging past. As for that black claw, the wind from the attack alone
had caused the ground to tear apart. The black-furred zombie,
bellowing, charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bei Zishan, prepare
to die!” Ning, while dodging the black-furred zombie,
simultaneously manifested more than four hundred sword-type magic
treasures, all of which were under Ning’s control and immediately
emanated a blurry white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed. There’s no
need to forcibly control them all. All I need to do is just guide
them into the correct flow. When I simply control the critical points
of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation…it becomes much easier to
control this Lesser Thousand Sword Formation.” Ning previously,
while meditating on formations, had tested out the fifth level of the
Lesser Thousand Sword Formation. At the underwater mansion, although
he had been able to use it, it had been too exhausting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this time, it was
clearly much easier for him. In addition, thanks to Ning’s nonstop
testing, his control over the 405 sword-type magic treasures had
become much more dexterous, and it became easier and easier for
Ning’s ‘divine will’ to control them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures!”
Zishan, astride his flying boat, saw this from afar. His face
changed. “He’s able to control magic treasures and fly on them.
So he is indeed a Zifu Disciple! So many sword-type magic
treasures….most likely they are almost all unranked, but so many
unranked magic treasures joined together still pose a formidable
threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaaaar.”
Growling, the black-furred zombie was still in pursuit of Ning,
attacking again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, relying on his
incomparably dexterous Windwing Evasion, was able to dodge aside time
and time again. In a battle of life and death, one had to rely on
one’s advantages. This black-furred zombie clearly was incomparably
strong and indestructibly tough. Battling with it head on was simply
idiocy. Ning naturally understood that this black-furred zombie was
probably reared by Bei Zishan. As long as he could kill Zishan, there
would be no need to fear this black-furred zombie.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser Thousand
Sword Formation, level five!” Ning constantly controlled the many
swords hovering around him, and given that his understanding of the
intricacies of the formation was rapidly increasing, his ability to
utilize it was become greater as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning’s eyes
suddenly flashed as he stared at the distant Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him, there
formed a flickering, unstable sword light, which suddenly shot out
into the distance, as fast as lightning, leaving behind only
seemingly solid yet seemingly illusory arc in the skies. It stabbed
directly towards the distant Bei Zishan. Zishan had long since
produced a horsetail whisk-type magic treasure in his hands, and
seeing the attack, he immediately brandished the horsetail whisk,
which transformed into three thousand white threads that sought to
entangle that piercing sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both this flying boat
as well this horsetail whisk were ranked magic treasures! Their power
was formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Zishan’s face changed, and he hurriedly controlled his horsetail
whisk, making it so that even as those three thousand white threads
were blocking and entangling the sword light, a large number of the
white threads were also emanating rays of light, with each layer of
them ablating and frantically neutralizing the oncoming force,
causing the sword light to have lost almost all of its power before
it even reached Zishan’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the distant
Ning’s face to change as well. The power of the fifth level of the
Lesser Thousand Swords Formation definitely wasn’t weak. The fourth
level could be comparable to an early Zifu Disciple using a ranked
magic treasure, so the fifth level had to be comparable to a more
formidable Zifu Disciple, right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really are a
Zifu Disciple.” Zishan stared at Ning, his face filled with
savagery. He shouted, “At such a young age, you are such a monster.
How can I possibly spare you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Zishan’s hands, a
black item suddenly appeared which looked like a wasp’s nest. At
the same time, it quickly grew greater, to the size of three meters
tall. It was filled with countless holes, and there with countless
buzzing sounds, one golden wasp after another swarmed out from those
countless holes, instantly charging out. In the blink of an eye,
those many wasps filled the skies, pouring towards Ning in a flood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venomous bugs.”
Ning was startled, and in front of his body, an utterly unstoppable
sword light formed once more. “Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword light pierced
through the skies, directly flying towards those countless, tightly
clustered swarm of golden wasps. With crackling sounds that were
quite unpleasant to hear, the sword light slaughtered hundreds of the
venomous bugs before having passed through to the other time. By now,
more than half of the energy of the sword light had been used up, and
it turned in an arc, once more stabbing into the swarm. This time,
however, it used up all of its power in the swarm, with another few
hundred of them having died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t let this
continue.” Ning, while using his wing-type magic treasures to
dodge, immediately discarded the notion of using the Lesser Thousand
Sword Formation to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lesser Thousand
Sword Formation used up a truly astonishing amount of energy. Ning
had only used the fifth level version of the attack twice, with a
single fourth level version of this attack. However, as a result,
only sixty or seventy percent of his Xiantian ki remained. There
were, however, hundreds of thousands of these venomous bugs, while a
single sword light of his had only killed seven or eight hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he had an
unlimited amount of Ki, most likely he would only be able to unleash
three more sword lights before the venomous bugs would have arrived
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dead for
sure.” Bei Zishan stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a low
growl, and surrounding him, one fiery lotus petal after another,
along with one water lotus petal after another, formed and merged,
creating a lotus bud that was protecting Ning around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three buds of
Waterflame Lotuses.” Ning had used his full strength. Every single
Waterflame Lotus bud was created from three lotus petals of fire and
three lotus petals of water. A larger lotus bud protected the smaller
lotus petals, and thus…these three layers of Waterflame Lotuses
surrounded Ning, who in the middle of them was constantly using his
Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason for this was
that the black-furred zombie was constantly chasing, causing Ning to
not dare to slack off in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bzzzzzz….” The
countless, tightly clustered venomous bugs spread out towards Ning,
wildly boring down towards the surface of the Waterflame Lotuses,
easily piercing through the first layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Waterflame
Lotuses that were formed into six layers were constantly swiveling,
and as the many venomous bugs sought to burrow through them, one
after another were killed by grinding, swiveling power of the layers
of the Waterflame Lotuses. However, they quickly reformed and
burrowed through the gaps between each of the layers of the
Waterflame Lotuses, continuing to burrow downwards. They quickly
passed through the second layer, the third layer, the fourth
layer…but many of the venomous bugs were dying as they did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A protective
technique that contains the True Meaning of the Dao! Where did this
Ji Ning learn this from?!” Watching so many of his venomous bugs
die from afar, Bei Zishan not only ached for his lost, he also was
astonished. This was because although a supreme sword technique was
precious, this sort of protective technique was even more precious.
Even in his own sect, such a technique would rarely be learned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he have
imagined…that this was a technique which Ning had developed on his
own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They broke through
the sixth level!” Ning, wielding his Darknorth swords, was wildly
blocking the venomous bugs who had broken through the sixth level.
However, the carapaces of these golden wasps were tough and very hard
to destroy. After blocking just a few, another wasp appeared, biting
Ning’s body, breaking through the protective armor, and chomping
down onto the flesh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning’s
Darknorth swords stabbed out wildly against the venomous bugs, while
the injuries to his body were automatically healing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t continue
like this. Although I have the body of a Fiendgod and will
automatically heal, as the numbers of these venomous bugs
increase…I’ll still be devoured alive by them in the end.” Ning
was frantic. “These venomous bugs are all under Bei Zishan’s
control. All I need to do is kill Bei Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ignored the
venomous bugs, preparing for a final, all-out assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has the body of a
Fiendgod.” Watching from afar atop his flying boat, Zishan couldn’t
wait any longer as well. His face was filled with rage. “His
regenerative abilities are so astonishing, and he also has that
protective technique! If this continues, even if my wasps are able to
devour him, the vast majority of my precious wasps will all die.
Although this magic treasure of mine hasn’t been completed yet, and
using it will cause great harm to the dread wraiths within…I can’t
wait any longer!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bei Zishan extended his
hand, and instantly, a bloody banner appeared. The banner circulated
with a layer of black light - solidified sin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the banner
appeared, the surrounding world seemed to grow dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, prepare to
die!” Bei Zishan brandished the banner in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bei Zishan, prepare
to die!” Ning, surrounded by the many venomous bugs who had broken
through his three Waterflame Lotuses and were wildly attacking him,
let out a bellow as well. Around him, 486 sword-type magic treasures
appeared. In this critical moment, Ning was wildly testing his own
limits as well, because if the fifth level couldn’t kill the enemy,
then if he was going to use this technique, he had to use the sixth
level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bloody banner
flapped in the air!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">486 sword-type magic
treasures also hovered there, as a blurry sword light appeared in
front of them!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Die__Bei_Zishan"></A>
Chapter 4 - Die, Bei Zishan!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had never
before used the sixth level of the Lesser Thousand Swords Formation
before. Originally, back at the Aquatic Manor, using the fifth level
alone had taken him to his limit. However, after he had spent time
training in accordance with the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], Ning
had learned how to better guide the swords in the Lesser Thousand
Sword Formation through certain patterns. When he had used the fifth
level, it had been fairly effortless for him, and so he now felt that
although it might be difficult for him to use the sixth level, he
should still be able to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to succeed.
If I fail, I die!” Ning put his full power on display, and 486
sword-type magic treasures hovered around him. Ning used his divine
will to carefully control the critical ‘juncture’ swords of the
Lesser Thousand Sword Formation, then slowly allowed the other swords
to follow those junctures, causing those 486 swords to constantly
fluctuate, like the waves in a sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was
difficult for Ning to control them, the 486 swords still began to
glow with that blurry white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success!” Although
Ning still had to defend against those wasps and even be bit by them,
while at the same time dodge against the attacking black-furred
zombie, Ning was incomparably excited! By relying on his successes in
developing formations, he had been able to manifest this sixth level
of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning stared
savagely at the distant Bei Zishan, standing on his flying boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of his body,
that incomparably sharp sword light coalesced, compressing to the
utmost limit possible, and then, following Ning’s will, shot out
like a meteor, slicing through the air and attacking towards Bei
Zishan with an utterly indomitable, unstoppable aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Standing
atop the boat, Zishan also brandished the bloody banner in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The banner stirred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world around them
turned dark, and one dread wraith after another, all visible to the
naked eye, moaned as they flew out from the banner. These dread
wraiths were the most powerful survivors of the battles between the
dread wraiths. Nourished by the banner, they had become even more
powerful! And this was with the treasure only being half completed;
if it had been completely forged, it would be truly formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite that, however,
this half-finished magic treasure was enough to allow Bei Zishan to
stare down arrogantly at the vast majority of Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devour you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless wraiths
were incomparably savage, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. After having
been nourished by the banner, these dread wraiths were capable of
making sounds now! They all charged forward in a flood towards Ning
at an impossibly fast speed. But of course, compared to Ning’s
Lesser Thousand Sword Formation’s sword light, the Lesser Thousand
Sword Formation’s sword light was still a bit faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hiss…” Zishan
brandished the horsetail whisk in his hand, and it transformed into
three thousand white strands, frantically attempting to block.
However, this sword light was far more powerful than the previous
one, and it chopped straight through the multiple layers. Bei Zishan
frantically lifted up the handle of the bloody banner which he was
holding, using it to block that sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the sword light was
just too fast. Zishan just barely managed to touch it in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…” The
sword light struck the handle of the banner, and the entire bloody
banner trembled slightly. The sword light instantly grew even weaker,
and then it finally slammed into the armor-type magic treasure which
Bei Zishan was wearing, that black robe. It just barely managed to
leave behind a black smudge on the black robe, and then it
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I
blocked it. It nearly broke through my body and claimed my life.”
Zishan was shocked as well. A battle against a Zifu Disciple was a
battle where death was always just a breath away. If one wasn’t
careful and was hit by an enemy’s attack, one would lose one’s
life. “Hmph. With those dread wraiths gnawing at him, he won’t be
able to concentrate enough to launch another one of these sword
lights. Those dread wraiths will gnaw him to death, no question about
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zishan was extremely
confident. Even if he himself was bitten by those dread wraiths, he
would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as those
countless, tightly clustered dread wraiths howl as they flew towards
him. His face couldn’t help but change. These howling dread wraiths
easily bypassed his six layers of Waterflame Lotuses. Dread wraiths
were ghosts, and so weapons and Waterflame Lotuses were completely
unable to block them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devour you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devour.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless dread wraiths
surged forward, instantly completely engulfing Ning within them,
wildly rushing into Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dead for
sure.” Watching from afar, Zishan was confidently awaiting the
moment when Ning would invariably collapse. However, immediately
afterwards, Zishan’s face began to change, because the bloody
banner within his hand was beginning to tremble, and its aura was
beginning to weaken as well as its power decreased. “What’s going
on? What…what is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zishan was shocked and
angered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This banner was his
trump card, his killing technique! But now, the aura of the banner
was weakening nonstop, which meant that the power of the banner was
dropping. The foundation of this magic treasure was those dread
wraiths…which meant there was only one possibility. Many dread
wraiths were dying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? Those dread wraiths are ghosts which are filled with hatred
and murder. There’s no weapon at all capable of blocking them, and
they are ripping and biting at the enemy’s soul. These countless
dread wraiths aren’t able to devour his soul?” Zishan didn’t
dare believe it. Even a Zifu Disciple’s soul probably wouldn’t be
able to withstand these ghosts for long before being utterly
devoured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was
there, and countless dread wraiths were flooding it, letting out
howls as they attempted to devour it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What to do?” In
his consciousness, Ning could sense those countless dread wraiths
flooding in. He was shocked. The soul was a person’s foundation; if
the soul was gone, then one wouldn’t even be able to reincarnate.
At the same time, Ning had never had the experience of battling
against ghosts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Nuwa
Painting].” This was the first thing which Ning thought of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his consciousness, a
Ji Ning dressed in white clothes appeared, sitting in the lotus
position. At the same time, behind his body, hovering in mid-air,
there appeared the form of Nuwa. Maiden Nuwa seemed to have become
truly timeless, with the passage of time not diminishing her in the
slightest. Her eyes were filled with grief and sympathy, like the
eyes of a mother. She also emanated boundless amounts of light,
covering the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the many dread
wraiths came charging over and touched the boundless light emanating
from Maiden Nuwa, the evil aura emanating from their forms truly
vanished. On their faces appeared smiles of peace and bliss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them looked
towards Ji Ning with grateful gazes. Some bowed in thanks, while
others knelt in thanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, one after
another vanished, returning to the Netherworld Kingdom to be reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many dread wraiths
continued to charge forwards, but the image of Maiden Nuwa dissolved
their evil auras, and once they were no longer possessed by that
evil, there was no way those ghosts could continue to remain here in
the mortal world. All of them thus went to the Netherworld Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, Ning’s own
soul was comparable to that of a Wanxiang Adept to begin with. Even
if he didn’t manifest a visualization of Maiden Nuwa, given the
power of his soul, there was no way these dread wraiths would have
been able to kill him…after all, the magic treasure was only half
complete. It was only useful against Zifu Disciples, and it wasn’t
strong enough to deal with Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if he had done
that, Ning would have been relying on the power of his soul to
forcibly kill each of those dread wraiths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning instead
visualized Maiden Nuwa, those dread wraiths were instead all purified
and sent to be reincarnated, which was a great karmic merit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this took a
long time to discuss, in truth, it happened in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no fear at all
of those countless dread wraiths charging into his body, attempting
to devour his soul. Instead, he just stared at the distant Bei
Zishan, and let out a bellow. “KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ray of sword light
flashed out, followed immediately by another one…four bursts of
sword light shot out towards the distant Zishan. These four bursts of
sword light virtually exhausted all of the Xiantian ki in Ning’s
body, as the amount remaining was not enough to permit him to unleash
a fifth. This was Ning’s full strength attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible? How could a youth not be afraid of his soul being devoured
by dread wraiths?!” Zishan, still gripping that bloody banner, was
in disbelief. When he saw those rays of sword light shoot out, he was
so terrified that he immediately controlled his flying boat to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could the speed
of the boat match the speed of the sword light flashes?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zishan, terrified,
brandished his horsetail whisk to defend while also thrusting out
with his banner, but although he was just barely able to block the
first attack, the second attack slashed outwards in an arc, directly
piercing through the black robes that served as an armor-type magic
treasure, stabbing into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two other rays of
sword light also instantly pierced through his head and his neck. In
the corner of his forehead, a hole appeared. His neck, meanwhile, was
completely cut through, and his head went flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible…” A
look of disbelief remained on Zishan’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant
black-furred zombie came to a halt as well, confusion appearing in
its eyes. As for those venomous wasps, many of whom had died as they
had thrown themselves in their attack on Ning, they quickly retreated
as well. Those three Waterflame Lotuses had crushed to death
countless wasps, and without an order from their master, they
naturally would prefer to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning
retrieve his sword-type magic treasures, a look of disbelief
appearing in his eyes. “I…I killed a Zifu Disciple? I succeeded?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From Bei Zishan’s
corpse, just as it was falling down from the flying boat, a golden
light suddenly appeared. Given Ning’s visual prowess, he could
instantly tell…that it was a golden bug!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?” A
golden bug actually flew out from the body? Ning felt puzzled, while
at the same time, he felt that something was off. He had the sense
that he couldn’t allow that golden bug to fly away…but his
Xiantian ki had been almost completely exhausted, while the
Waterflame Lotus wasn’t capable of being manifested at such a great
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the entire
world seemed to transform from day into night. In the night sky, many
stars twinkled and flashed, and as they did, the countless stars
seemed to have transformed into a stellar sea. Within that stellar
sea, there was an enormous full moon, and as the light of the moon
shone down, the soft moonlight landed upon the body of that
frantically fleeing golden bug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden bug seemed
to be utterly terrified, flying at high speed and trying to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly, that soft
moonlight solidified into a giant hand, with gently grasped that
golden bug, which in its incomparable terror, let out a terrified
cry. “Spare me, spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crunch!” With a
light squeeze of the giant moonlight hand, the golden bug was crushed
into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, that night
sky, those millions of stars, and that moon all disappeared, with the
skies once more returning to daylight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is…”
Ning stood there, his face filled with shock. “A Manifestation of
stars…a Wanxiang Adept! A Wanxiang Adept!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were too
careless.” From high up in the air, a man flew over on the wind,
dressed in a blue robe and with long, unbound hair. He had a smile on
his face. “You worked so hard to kill the body of that Bei Zishan,
but you almost let him borrow the body of the Life Gu-Bug to flee.
Bei Zishan was an expert in using bugs, so naturally he raised a Life
Gu-Bug. In killing him, you should’ve killed his Life Gu-Bug as
well. By not doing so, you almost wasted all of your previous effort.
That wouldn’t have been good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that he
had met a major figure today. Swallow Mountain didn’t have any
Wanxiang Adepts. Ning immediately bowed respectfully. “Ji Ning
greets you, senior.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Wanxiang_Adept"></A>
Chapter 5 - Wanxiang Adept
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man, his
long hair fluttering in the wind, descended in front of Ji Ning.
Laughing, he said, “My surname is Mu, while my name is Xiao. Others
address me as Adept Mu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
Adept Mu.” Ning felt his heart calm down. This Wanxiang Adept whom
he had never met had just told Ning his name and surname. Clearly, he
held an excellent opinion of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Adept Mu,
for intervening. Otherwise, if this Bei Zishan were to have fled, he
most likely would have caused more calamities in the future.” Ning
immediately expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu had a smile on
his face as he shook his head. “Actually, I should be the one
thanking you. I came here for the purpose of killing this Bei Zishan,
and I spent months investigating before I found him hiding here.
Unfortunately, this Bei Zishan set up that large formation. Although
I am a Wanxiang Adept, if I were to attempt to break the formation…I
didn’t have confidence in my ability to do so. Thus, I have been
waiting here. I was planning to wait until he left the formation
before exterminating him, but I didn’t expect that I would end up
personally witnessing a fine performance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So this Adept Mu had
been hiding here early on, and had been watching everything occur?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, you
broke open the formation.” Adept Mu sighed. “Only then did I know
that it was you who did it. A youth who was able to break this
formation. Formidable. In addition, I didn’t expect that all of
those Dao-Soldiers, Xiantian lifeforms, and even Bei Zishan himself
would be disposed of, all by you alone. Hahaha…that made things
simple for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had known that
Adept Mu was present, then I wouldn’t have had to exhaust myself.”
Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu looked
curiously at Ning. “Ji Ning, I wish to ask you. Are you a Zifu
Disciple? Or a Xiantian lifeform?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A person’s strength
couldn’t be judged from the surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Adept Mu was
someone who had been watching for a very long time from outside. In
particular, after Ning broke open the formation, he had watched
carefully as Ning engaged in those battles. As the saying goes, the
eyes of the viewers are the clearest…Adept Mu discovered a number
of issues which made him believe that Ning shouldn’t be a Zifu
Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have not yet
established my ‘Violet Palace’.” Ning didn’t hide it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu immediately
revealed a look of surprise. “Indeed! I saw that your swordplay is
exquisite, and that you should have reached the level of the ‘True
Meaning of the Dao’. If you were a Zifu Disciple, when you used
your elemental energy to execute such exquisite swordplay…you
should have been able to easily defeat that black-furred zombie, and
that battle should have been very simple for you. But you were
actually in dire straits, which is why I guessed that you shouldn’t
be a Zifu Disciple. Only, if you aren’t a Zifu Disciple, then you
must be using ‘divine will’ to control all those sword-type magic
treasures and fly with them. You, a mere Xiantian lifeform, have such
a powerful soul. This truly is rare, quite rare!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t deny it,
because even in the records and books he had read, he had read of
some incomparably monstrous Xiantian lifeforms who were able to do
what he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My soul was powerful
at birth.” Ning said. “Ever since I was a child, I could divide
my mind. Afterwards, when I gained insights into the True Meaning of
the Dao, my divine will was formed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Facing a Wanxiang
Adept, a person with the power to easily destroy him, Ning naturally
didn’t have to play any games. Since he was an incomparably
monstrous talent, he had to show it off. That might even be of
benefit to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to ask you
another thing.” Adept Mu looked at Ning, as though he were looking
at a piece of unpolished jade. “Are you training in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha….” Adept
Mu laughed delightedly. “Do you know who I am? Why I was in pursuit
of Bei Zishan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at Adept
Mu, then shook his head. He had never met the man; how could he know
who he was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu said directly,
“I am a Raindragon Guard of the Grand Xia Dynasty. I am under
orders to pursue and kill Bei Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindragon Guard?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he had killed
that Diremonster, Serpentwing, his parents had given him a general
explanation of the Stillwater Commandery, and how there was a
powerful force within it that absolutely could not be offended; the
Raindragon Guards! The Raindragon Guards was the most powerful
military organization within the Grand Xia Dynasty, completely
composed of Immortal practitioners, and according to legend, only
those at least at the Wanxiang Adept level were able to join.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon Guards
had an extremely special status. They directly served the Grand Xia
Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the
incomparably numerous forces and powers spread across the entire
Stillwater Commandery, the two most highly ranked were the Marquis of
Stillwater and the Raindragon Guards! The Marquis of Stillwater was
the master of this area, and his roots here were very deep. But the
Raindragon Guards were directly subordinate to the Grand Xia Dynasty.
They themselves had numerous experts, and behind them they had the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty as their backer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Adept Mu
looked at Ning. “The Grand Xia Dynasty’s Raindragon Guards are
the most powerful force in existence in this vast land. No single
tribe, no single school, no single sect…can come even close to
comparing with my Raindragon Guards!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded,
acknowledging this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindragon
Guards are quite independent and under no restrictions. Once you
become a Raindragon Guard, you can be blessed with a tribe, and that
you can carve out a territory of ten thousand kilometers for the land
of your tribe. This land will be protected by the Raindragon Guards!
Even if you die, the Raindragon Guards will protect that land for a
thousand years. No power will dare invade it, as if they do, that
would signify a challenge to the Raindragon Guards, and we Raindragon
Guards will tear out any such invading force by their very roots!”
Adept Mu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had heard his
father say as well that the Raindragon Guards did indeed have an
exalted status, and even their tribes would benefit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept, you’ve said
so many things, but I cannot become a Raindragon Guard.” Ning
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu just looked at
Ning. “I ask you this. Are you willing to become a Raindragon
Guard?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ME!?” Ning’s
eyes widened. “I…I’m just a Xiantian lifeform. Even if I want
to, my power is far from being sufficient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Adept Mu just shook
his head. “It isn’t a major issue if your power is weak. Right
now, you aren’t able to directly join the Raindragon Guards, but
our Raindragon Guards has an auxiliary corps as well! Much like how
some schools, sects, and tribes will intentionally attract some
geniuses to join them, we Raindragon Guards also have an auxiliary
corps which will draw in some geniuses to join for instruction and
guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upon joining the
auxiliary corps, you’ll have access to all sorts of training
techniques and even divine abilities.” Adept Mu sighed. “If you
consider the Raindragon Guards to be a school or a sect, then we are
the most powerful one of all. We have countless Immortals
practitioners, and even Celestial Immortals have appeared from within
our ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, the
threshold for joining the auxiliary corps is quite high. It isn’t
just anyone who can join. Fortunately, you train in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one Fiendgod
Body Refining technique in the world.” Adept Mu looked at Ning.
“Anyone who relies on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] to become a Xiantian lifeform can immediately enter the
auxiliary corps. There’s no need to undergo the various trials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is simply too hard. Every single person
who can use it to become a Xiantian lifeform is a monstrous talent.”
Adept Mu sighed emotionally. Ning, standing there, made a sound of
agreement. It was true. He himself had spent that night meditating on
the Dao before understanding how to fuse fire and water and to break
through to become a Xiantian lifeform. Others most likely would also
have to find their own secret ways to fuse fire and water as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single
Immortal practitioner who trains in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens] is extraordinary.” Adept Mu said. “For ordinary
Immortal practitioners, only those at the Wanxiang Adept level are
permitted to join the Raindragon Guards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But for
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] practitioners, as long as
they reach the Zifu level and learn a divine ability, their battle
power will be equivalent to a Wanxiang Adept’s, and thus they would
be allowed the chance to enter the Raindragon Guards. But of course,
that just means you’ll have the chance to; whether or not you’ll
actually be able to enter depends on your ability.” Adept Mu said.
“I myself only was able to join the Raindragon Guards after
becoming a late-stage Wanxiang Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this,
blinked twice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late-stage Wanxiang?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon Guards
truly were difficult to join!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
those thousands of surviving Dao-Soldiers were all staring towards
this direction in terror. From the skies, two figures descended as
well; they were the human forms of the Azure Firebird and the black
serpent. They, too, stared towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You go rescue Master
Blindfish and the others. I have some things to discuss with this
senior.” Ning immediately instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Azure
Firebird and the black serpent responded. After having watched the
grand battle between Ning and Bei Zishan, their hearts were filled
with dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
frantically worried about his mother, he naturally couldn’t slight
or be discourteous to this Wanxiang Adept in front of him. Ning even
had the intention of inviting him to go to West Prefecture City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you join
the prepatory army, your future prospects will be limitless.” Adept
Mu said. “In the future, you becoming a Raindragon Guard will be a
matter of course. The chances you will have there will be far greater
than what you have here in the tribes, at least. Think about it
carefully. If you are willing to join the auxiliary corps, then go
back and bid your parents farewell. I will take you directly to
Stillwater City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Stillwater City?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mu.” Ning
said hurriedly. “There are so many benefits to joining the
auxiliary corps. I fear there must be some sacrifices as well,
right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally.” Adept
Mu nodded. “Upon joining the auxiliary corps, until you become a
Zifu Disciple, you are forever forbidden from leaving the mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forever forbidden
from leaving the mountain?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu said, “The
headquarters of we Raindragon Guards is located on the peaks of a
tall mountain. The auxiliary corps is there as well! If you can’t
even become a Zifu Disciple, then you will simply die of age on the
mountain. After becoming a Zifu Disciple, you can often leave, but
you’ll still need to spend most of your time on the mountain, as
you’ll only leave on orders. Only when you become a Raindragon
Guard will you have freedom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could tell that the
auxiliary corps was actually comparable to a school. If one didn’t
become a Zifu Disciple, one wasn’t permitted to leave, while even
after becoming a Zifu Disciple, one would be stationed on the
mountain and only be allowed to leave on orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have my Aquatic
Manor.” Ning said to himself. “Immortal Juhua, by relying on that
ancient Aquatic Manor, was able to live for millions of years, even
as a Loose Immortal, and his power was comparable to a Celestial
Immortal…there are many secrets contained within the Aquatic Manor
which I must investigate. Once I become a Zifu Disciple, I’ll be
able to bind the control talisman. Why should I be in a hurry to join
the auxiliary corps?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu, standing
there, spoke again. “Ning, who in the Swallow Mountains can
possibly provide you tutelage? For someone as naturally gifted as
you, you must expand your horizons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Adept.”
Ning pondered for a time, then shook his head. “Adept, I imagine
that you heard as well that my mother is gravely ill. For now, I
don’t wish to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu, hearing this,
nodded. “Since that’s the case, I won’t press you. This is the
talisman of the Raindragon Guards. In the future, if you encounter
any danger on the road to Stillwater City, if you show off this
talisman, perhaps it might be of use.” As he spoke, he turned over
his hand, and a square black talisman appeared in his palm, with the
image of a Rain Dragon on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Adept.”
Ning immediately accepted it. “Ji Ning has one thing to request of
you, Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu immediately
laughed. “You assisted me in exterminating Bei Zishan of Snowdragon
Mountain. I had wanted to help send you to Stillwater City to enter
the auxiliary corps of the Raindragon Guard, but I didn’t expect
you wouldn’t want to go…I was worrying about how to repay your
assistance. Go ahead and tell me. If I can help you, I will.

Chapter 6 - Returning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain?
Bei Zishan? This Bei Zishan had been a Zifu Disciple of Snowdragon
Mountain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning temporarily
suppressed this line of thought, then immediately said with
sincerity, “My mother is gravely ill. I expect that my Ji clan is
unable to save her. I would like to ask you, Adept Mu, to go on a
trip to visit my Ji clan of the West Prefecture and save my mother’s
life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu saw the look
on Ning’s face, and he couldn’t help but sigh. “I’m not
talented in medical treatments, but I can go take a look. If I can
save her, naturally I will. But if I cannot…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept, if you are
willing to go, Ji Ning will be forever grateful.” Ning said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scum, get over
here!” Adept Mu suddenly turned and stared into the distance,
barking loudly. From afar, that black-furred zombie whose entire body
was swirling with that necromantic aura walked over obediently,
staring at Adept Mu with a hint of dread in its oily green eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu waved his
hand, and a violet coffin appeared in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu gave the
order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred zombie
obediently opened the coffin, then leapt in and lay down, then closed
the lid behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
corpse-preserving coffin.” Adept Mu, with a wave of his hand, took
back the corpse-preserving coffin while explaining to Ning, “This
black-furred zombie had just lost its master. If it were to be
permitted to roam about, it would definitely harm many people. Thus,
when I was speaking with you, I used a thread of my ki bind it to
myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. You
were the one to kill Bei Zishan, and so I won’t touch any of the
things he left behind.” Adept Mu said. “Only, at your current
level of power, you are not able to tame this black-furred zombie,
and so I am taking it with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Adept Mu
looked at the distant corpse of Bei Zishan. Zishan’s corpse
immediately flew over, along with his various magic treasures,
including the flying boat, his horsetail whisk, the bloody banner,
and the nest which held the hornets. Adept Mu reached out with his
hand, and a ring which had been on Zishan’s fingers flew off,
entering Adept Mu’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a ranked
storage-type magic treasure.” Adept Mu said. “You are unable to
bind it, so I will help you in retrieving the items within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Adept Mu
completed his binding of the ring, and as he did, a large number of
miscellaneous items appeared out of nowhere onto the ground, amongst
which were Dao Battle-Armor suits, foodstuffs, some golden items, as
well as some alchemical ingredients as well as various bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
look of your skin, you should have suffered a poisoning by the
Hearteater Powder.” Adept Mu flipped his hand, and one of the
little bottles on the ground flew up, with the words ‘Hearteater
Antidote’ written atop it. Clearly, with so many bottles present,
Zishan himself was worried that he would use a wrong bottle, and so
had labeled all of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu opened the
bottle’s plug, glanced at it, then nodded. “This is the antitode.
Eat a pill. You can collect these various items and ranked magic
treasures as well…although you are currently unable to bind them,
when you become a Zifu Disciple, you will be. Don’t have any
worries; although these things are treasures to you; they aren’t
worth anything to me at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Adept.”
Ning was very grateful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he knew that
these things weren’t worth much to the Adept, the actions of this
Adept Mu were clean and decisive. How could Ning not feel grateful
for how well the man was treating him, a mere Xiantian lifeform?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One day, I
absolutely must repay this kindness.” Ning said to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swallowed the
pill, which gave off a clear, fragrant taste, almost like a pellet of
sugar. As soon as the pellet entered his stomach, it immediately
dissolved. Soon, he felt a warm sensation throughout his entire body,
and every single bit of Hearteater poison that was spread throughout
his body suddenly dissolved like the snow, quickly and completely
disappearing. The pain which had been spreading throughout his body
vanished as well, and those red spots on his face faded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This hornet’s
nest…” Adept Mu pointed at the hornet’s nest, which had many
venomous hornets within. “The hornet’s nest is an unranked magic
treasure. You can bind it. However, as for the many hornets within
the nest…to control them mentally, you’ll have to become a Zifu
Disciple, and then slowly bind them with your Ki. Prior to becoming a
Zifu Disciple, remember to often bring them food to eat. Don’t
starve them to death. If they are starved, they will start to kill
each other and devour each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded
immediately. “Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and bind
the hornet’s nest. Oh. Here’s a manual on binding hornets. This
is a secret manual of Snowdragon Mountain. It isn’t that precious,
but it does contain the basics for binding hornets and pests.”
Adept Mu immediately saw a fur-clad book amongst Bei Zishan’s
possessions. “Binding hornets is fairly simple. Only, finding them
is very hard, and so too is raising them. There’s no need for you
to be in a rush to learn. These things can wait for you to become a
Zifu Disciple before learning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
manual, which had three characters atop it: [Insect Binding Manual].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because this
hornet’s nest has venomous insects, there’s no way you can store
it within a storage-type magic treasure.” Adept Mu handed the nest
to Ning. “However, the hornet’s nest can change in size. You can
shrink it, then carry it on you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
acknowledged. He immediately accepted the enormous black hornet’s
nest. Prior to handing it over, Adept Mu had already erased the
remaining magic power that the hornet’s nest had contained, and so
Ning was able to easily bind it. Otherwise, Ning would have had to
spend an enormous amount of time just wiping out the remnant magic
power left behind by Bei Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Smaller, smaller,
smaller.” Ning looked at the black hornet’s nest rapidly shrink,
until it was the size of a finger. With a flip of his hand, he picked
up a cloth sack, then placed the hornet’s nest within it. He placed
the sack within his clothes, and the armor-type magic treasure he was
wearing shifted in configuration slightly, accommodating the sack
within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Collect them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and collected the many miscellaneous items on the ground, as well as
manuals and poisons which Bei Zishan had left behind.As for Bei
Zishan’s ranked magic treasures, Ning didn’t touch them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These ranked magic
treasures.” Adept Mu pointed at the bloody banner as he spoke. “I
am going to take away this Myriad Wraiths Banner. This is a magic
treasure which was birthed from sins. I need to take it back…and it
is also proof that I’ve accomplished my mission. You can keep the
rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Only now
did Ning collect the other ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was unable to use
any of them, and so all he could do was to collect them for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Myriad Wraiths
Banner…” Adept Mu picked up the bloody banner, which glowed with
a faintly visible black aura. “Who knows how many people were
tortured to death to create it? What a terrible, weighty sin! This
Bei Zishan really was fated to die; he actually used this Myriad
Wraiths Banner against you, but your soul is already at the ‘divine
will’ level. How could this incomplete Myriad Wraiths Banner
possibly do anything to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu was under the
impression that Ning had relied on his powerful so to destroy all of
those dread wraiths. He didn’t know that Ning had, in reality, had
relied upon a visualization of Maiden Nuwa in order to pacify all of
those dread wraiths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. This is sin.
Sin so heavy, one can see it with the naked eye. And yet, boundless
karmic merits are very hard to see.” Adept Mu pointed at the black
aura surrounding the bloody banner. “Sin which one can already see
with the naked eye…you can imagine how grave and serious the sin
is. We Raindragon Guards naturally must exterminate a person who has
committed such grave sins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain
cave, Blindfish and the others had their bodies and clothes covered
with blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, lift them
up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black serpent and
the Azure Firebird were shouting at those servants. How could the
servants dare to resist? They obediently lifted, carried, and
piggybacked those who were unable to walk on their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is young
master Ji Ning?” Blindfish and Ji Jadewich asked, along with
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black serpent just
said, “The young master is outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish was still
able to walk on his own, but Jadewich had to be lifted. All of them
walked out of the cave, and as they did, they saw those thousands of
terrified Dao-Soldiers, as well as the corpses which litered the
ground, as well as Ji Ning, off in the distance, who was currently
chatting with Adept Mu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look.
When he saw his master Blindfish, his entire body covered with blood,
as well as Jadewich and the others be carried over, he couldn’t
help but feel his heart ache. He couldn’t help but call out,
“Master Blindfish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Blindfish spoke as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you all…”
Ning didn’t know what to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master Ji Ning.” Not just the people of the Ji clan; even those
Xiantian lifeforms of the Riverbank clan, the Ironwood clan, the Kou
clan, and the various other clans, all of whom had their dantians
shattered, spoke out in gratitude. The destruction of their dantians
made them cripples, but they already felt boundless gratitude for
being able to see the sun again and for being able to return to live
amongst their clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Ning felt
boundless sourness. These people included the enemies of the Ji clan,
true, but in the past, they were glorious, respected Xiantian
lifeforms. But now, all of their dantians had been destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hint of excitement
he had felt prior to this when he had acquired all of those treasures
of Bei Zishan completely vanished. Ning turned to look towards those
servants and barked, “How many more people are imprisoned within
this mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s most
likely more than a million people imprisoned here, but it’s hard to
say if even half remain alive.” Immediately, some servants spoke
out nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a sin!” Adept
Mu shook his head and sighed. “Ji Ning…these thousands of
Dao-Soldiers as well as hundreds of thousands of surviving
commoners…let those two spirit-beasts deal with them. The two of
you, remember that those thousands of Dao-Soldiers were innocent.
They were forced to do what they did by Bei Zishan. Do not further
violate the proscriptions against murder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The black
serpent and the Azure Firebird hurriedly nodded. They had previously
seen the power of those Flood Dragon Dao-Soldiers. Although they
could spare the lives of those Dao-Soldiers, they absolutely would
take away those Dao Battle-Armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll handle
everything here to you two.” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
The black serpent and the Azure Firebird responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, let’s go.
Let’s go to your Ji clan’s West Prefecture City.” Adept Mu
said. “I can bring these people along as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he waved
his hand, and a leaf appeared out of nowhere. The leaf rapidly
expanded in size, and soon became an enormous leaf that was dozens of
meters long. Ning, seeing this, immediately had Master Blindfish,
Jadewich, and the other members of the Ji clan all stand atop the
leaf. As for the Kou clan, the Riverbank clan, and the other clans,
they temporarily rested here, awaiting their clan’s forces to come
pick them up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu, Ning,
Blindfish, and the other Xiantian lifeforms of the Ji clan who had
their dantians destroyed had all mounted the leaf. The enormous green
leaf, dozens of meters long, flew rapidly into the air, quickly
flying beyond the peaks of the mountains and disappearing into the
skies.

Chapter 7 - Seeing Mother
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The single green leaf
had Ji Ning as well as more than twenty others on it. It flew through
the clouds, hurrying towards the direction of West Prefecture City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was either
seated or lying down, while Ning and Adept Mu Xiao were standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept, prior to
this, you said that Bei Zishan was from Snowdragon Mountain?” Ning
asked the question he had been contemplating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Snowdragon
Mountain.” Adept Mu glanced at Ning and nodded. “Snowdragon
Mountain can be considered one of the most powerful forces of the
entire Stillwater Commandery, and within the school, there are
multiple Primal Daoists who stand guard. Their roots are quite deep.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple Primal
Daoists?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely because
the school is so large and it has so many methods of training, it
also possessed some evil techniques, and so naturally, it will also
have some Immortal practitioners who have embarked upon an evil
path.” Adept Mu said. “Snowdragon Mountain cares more about
power, and thus within it, it possesses Demon practitioners, Evil
practitioners, Immortal practitioners, Buddhist practitioners, and
all sorts of other practitioners. It values power the most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu sighed,
“Precisely because within it, the ‘fish and dragons are mixed
together’, many people are attracted to Snowdragon Mountain,
causing its power to grow even more enormous. Some Zifu Disciples who
have departed from it will establish their own territory elsewhere,
under the banner of Snowdragon Mountain. They can be considered
branches, I suppose. These branches will often collect some talented
youths and send them to the main school. Thus, Snowdragon Mountain
continues to grow more and more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course,
compared to our Raindragon Guards…Snowdragon Mountain is
incomparably inferior.” Adept Mu laughed. “Any one of the Loose
Immortals which we Raindragon Guards have stationed here in the
Stillwater Commadery is capable of eradicating the entire Snowdragon
Mountain school.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain was
nothing more than a school, while the Raindragon Guards was the most
powerful military force the Grand Xia Dynasty possessed, overawing
the entire world. Of course they weren’t on the same level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. We’re here.”
Adept Mu pointed into the distance. “West Prefecture City is up
ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re here?”
Ning was stunned. He saw that in the distance, there was a forest
which surrounded a magnificent city. This was indeed West Prefecture
City, where he had lived since he was young. Ning couldn’t help but
feel stunned. “The speed at which Wanxiang Adepts travel on their
magic treasures truly is astonishing! A distance of thousands of
kilometers was travelled in the blink of an eye.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning began to
worry. “I wonder how Mother is doing. Mother has always been well.
Why is she suddenly gravely ill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within West Prefecture
City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow was resting
in her room, while outside of the room, her husband, Ji Yichuan, was
currently speaking with Ji Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is all caused
by that calamity from the past.” Yichuan shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire sat there,
nodding slightly. “That disaster changed the destiny of the two of
you, husband and wife. Yichuan, you were the most talented genius our
Ji clan had produced in a thousand years. When you were a child and
your father died, you suddenly began to soar…you had already
established your ‘Violet Palace’ and embarked onto the path of
Immortals as a Zifu Disciple. Unfortunately, it was all ruined.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter
if my future potential on the path of Immortals is gone.” Yichuan
shook his head and sighed. “During that disaster, the elder brother
of my wife, the most powerful of us three, lost his life for the sake
of protecting myself and Snow. Snow had already been badly injured,
but for the sake of birthing Ning, she utilized a secret technique
that used up her own lifeforce…although my future potential on the
Immortal path has been destroyed, I got off the easiest, out of the
three of us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire shook his head
gently, sighing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fate makes fools of
men!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adventuring in the
vast, boundless world outside was indeed far more dangerous than
living here in Swallow Mountain. Experts were as common as the
clouds. There would be lucky encounters, but there would also be
disastrous ones. For example, when the Yuchi siblings and Yichuan had
met with that crisis, the result had been this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ninefire
suddenly lifted his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From high up in the
air, a green leaf was slashing through the skies until it landed
within a courtyard. Atop this leaf were Adept Mu, Ning, Blindfish,
Jadewich, and many others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Yichuan
stared in astonishment at the people in front of him, then
immediately dashed over. “Jadewich, Shan, Blindfish…you all came
back? What happened to all of you? How is it that all of you are
injured? What have you all been doing these past days? Why did you
all suddenly go missing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
Patriarch.” The twenty-plus Xiantian lifeforms of the Ji clan
quickly recognized their Patriarch, and in unison, they immediately
called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire naturally knew
that more than twenty Xiantian lifeforms of his clan had gone
missing, and he had been utterly frustrated by this affair. Now,
seeing these Xiantian lifeforms all reappear, he was both surprised
and delighted. He hurriedly said, “When we realized you had gone
missing, our entire Ji clan started to serach for you. Are you all
well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our dantians have
been destroyed, but we are very lucky to still be alive.” Jadewich
said hoarsely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dantians destroyed?”
Ninefire stared, wide-eyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A nearby youth with
long hair called out as well, “Patriarch, it was only thanks to Ji
Ning as well as this Adept that we were able to survive this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept?” Ninefire
and Yichuan felt a surge of electricity in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then that meant this
was a Wanxiang Adept! The entire Swallow Mountain area didn’t have
a single Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two both looked at
Adept Mu. Actually, when they first saw him, they had the feeling
that this was an extraordinary figure. To be able to ride on a magic
treasure to come here…they guessed that he was at least a Zifu
Disciple, but they didn’t expect that he was actually a Wanxiang
Adept. They saw how Ning was standing to the side of this Wanxiang
Adept, as though they seemed to be on good terms. In their hearts,
they couldn’t help but feel puzzled as to how Ning had managed to
end up getting to know this Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire (Ji
Yichuan) greets you, Adept.” Ninefire and Yichuan both said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, I’m the
one who should be thanking Ji Ning.” Adept Mu laughed calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Ninefire
and Yichuan looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of worry
appeared on Ning’s face, and he immediately said, “I learned that
Mother is gravely ill, so I invited Adept Mu to come to our West
Prefecture City…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow is right inside
the room.” Yichuan suddenly realized, and he immediately spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu Xiao nodded,
then walked towards the nearby room. Ning and Yichuan followed
behind, while Ning asked softly while walking, “Father, what
happened? How could Mother suddenly have fallen ill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was that illness
left behind in the past.” Yichuan said. “I’ll explain to you in
detail later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the
room, they had the maidservants leave. Aside from Snow, who was lying
on the bed, only Adept Mu, Ning, Yichuan, and Ninefire were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow opened her
eyes, looking at the newcomers. She couldn’t help but reveal a
trace of puzzlement in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow, this is Adept
Mu, whom Ning asked to come.” Yichuan said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Snow
immediately used her arms to prop herself up. “Yuchi Snow greets
you, Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me your right
hand.” Adept Mu sat down on the stone bench next to the bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow extended her
rather ashen right hand. She saw, now, that standing by the side of
Adept Mu was Ning. She looked at her son…and as she did, a look of
delight appeared on Snow’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu stretched out
with a single finger, gently tapping it on Snow’s wrist.
Immediately, a spot of green light, filled with life energy, spread
out, quickly enveloping Snow’s entire body. Ning and Yichuan,
seated nearby and watching, felt restlessness in their hearts. After
waiting for a good long while, Adept Mu began to frown. “Strange.
Strange.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this,
felt nervousness in his heart. He hurriedly asked, “Adept, my
Mother, she…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still frowning, Adept
Mu said, “Although I’m not specialized in medicine, I can tell
that your Mother doesn’t have any sickness. Rather, her lifeforce
has been almost entirely used up…given how little lifeforce your
mother has left in her body, she’ll most likely be able to live
just three more months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her lifeforce has
nearly been used up?” Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When my wife was
pregnant, she was injured.” The nearby Yichuan said hurriedly.
“Afterwards, she then used a secret technique which spent her own
vitality to protect the fetus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu nodded. “Your
wife was originally a Xiantian lifeform, and judging from the purity
of the remnants of ki in her body, she should have been a peak
Xiantian lifeform. Unfortunately…that injury she suffered should
have been a severe one. Her dantian was destroyed, and logically
speaking, she shouldn’t have been able to preserve the fetus. Your
wife used a secret technique to ignite her own lifeforce in order to
protect the fetus, but the cost of this secret technique was
extremely great. To replenish what the usage of it cost is almost
impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning was
flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother had been a
peak Xiantian expert? Her dantian had been destroyed, and she had
used a secret technique to ignite her own lifeforce to protect the
fetus?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, from what he
had seen from when his mother had taught him footwork, she was indeed
an expert. However, that year when he had been in his mother’s
womb, what exactly had happened? His parents had always intentionally
hidden the truth of what had happened when his mother was pregnant
from Ning, refusing to tell him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept, please save
my mother.” Ning said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To save her, the
only method is to extend her lifespan.” Adept Mu sighed. “There
are plenty of spirit pills for curing diseases, and I myself have
spirit pills that can be used for Immortal practitioners to extend
their lifespan. But unfortunately…to let a mortal have an extended
lifespan is thousands of times more difficult than to have an
Immortal practitioner extend their lifespans. This sort of medicine
is something which I, in the Raindragon Guards, have only heard of. I
don’t even know where to find them. Most likely, only Immortals
would be able to produce them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninefire,
hearing this, was shocked. Raindragon Guards?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortals!”
Hearing this, Ning felt as though his heart had suddenly turned to
ice.

Chapter 8 - Learning Acceptance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mu Xiao left that
very day for Stillwater City. Before leaving, he pulled Ji Ning aside
to give him advice in private. “Ji Ning, your talent is extremely
high. It is guaranteed that you will walk far on the path of
Immortals! Immortal practitioners have very long lifespans. Unless
his friends and family are also Immortal practitioners, you will have
to watch as all of them die of old age. Actually, this is a form of
self-improvement with regards to your mind towards the Dao. Since you
have become an Immortal practitioner…you need to be prepared. No
matter how much pain you suffer, you must escape from the midst of
your grief. Otherwise, it will be very hard for you to overcome the
Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Adept Mu left, Ji
Ninefire also immediatedly headed towards the mountain where Bei
Zishan had hidden himself. That place, after all, had Flood Dragon
Dao Battle-Armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning travelled by
himself to Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s still
hope. My mother still has hope for surviving.” Ning ran through the
mountainous, forested wilderness, occasionally using his Windwing
Evasion to advance. His running speed was far faster than the
travelling speed of those black beasts, and after expending a large
majority of his divine power, he managed to arrive at Serpentwing
Lake in just two hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ancient Aquatic
Manor has had multiple masters. Immortal Juhua was the third master.
Ignoring the other masters, Immortal Juhua himself had lived for
millions of years as a Loose Immortal. He definitely had quite a few
medicines, and perhaps some of them are able to allow mortals to have
extended lifespans.” Ning ran across the surface of the water to
the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
people on the island, who had arrived long ago to build a residence
there. Autumn Leaf and that young child, Bluestone, were there as
well. Seeing Ning run in their direction across the surface of the
water, they immediately went to welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have something to
do. You can retire for now.” Ning instructed, then immediately
transformed into a blur, disappearing from their field of vision.
This caused Autumn Leaf and the other servants to feel rather
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning soon arrived at
the entrance to the cave. He continuously went deeper in, and after a
few moments, he arrived at the place where he had been teleported
away from last time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning called out
frantically. “Quick, let me enter the estate. I have something
important to do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark tunnel caverns
were completely silent. There was no response at all. This caused
Ning to be all the more frantic. The old black bull had originally
said…that Ning should only return after he had bound the control
talisman. But currently, he was just an early Xiantian lifeform. How
long would it be before he would become a Zifu Disciple? His mother
only had three months left. He had no other options, besides coming
here and begging!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, I truly have
an urgent matter involving life-and-death. I sincerely implore you,
Senior, to let me in.” Ning begged frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the
surrounding space twisted, and in the cavernous area in front of him,
an enormous bear’s head once more appeared. The bear’s head
opened its giant mouth, swallowing Ning within it, and Ning
disappeared from within the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime twisted…and
then all was calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared in front of
him. In front of him was that majestic, ancient palace hall, in the
center of which were those incomparably enormous prayer mats. An old
black bull ambled over and let out a sigh. “Ji Ning, didn’t I
tell you to wait until you bound the control talisman, at which point
you would be able to naturally sense the Aquatic Manor and come as
you pleased? You are just a Xiantian lifeform. Why have you entered
again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning said
hurriedly. “My mother is gravely ill. I truly have no other
methods, so I came here to beg.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your mother is
gravely ill?” The old black bull shook his head. “Since you have
chosen the path of Immortals, you need to be prepared for these
things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly shook
his head. “Senior, my mother is still young. She shouldn’t die so
soon! Previously, I asked a Wanxiang Adept to help take a look at my
mother…and that Wanxiang Adept said that my mother, in the past,
had used a secret technique to expend her own lifeforce to rescue me.
By now, her lifeforce is almost completely used up, and she only has
three months of life left. To save my mother, a medicinal pill that
can allow mortals to extend their lifespans is necessary. However,
that Wanxiang Adept himself had only heard of such pills, and said
that most likely only Immortals were in possession of them. I have no
other choices, and so I came to the Aquatic Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A medicinal pill
that can allow mortals to extend their lifespans?” The old black
bull sighed. “That is something that can described as an Immortal
pill. Generally speaking, only Loose Immortals or Earthly Immortals
can produce such a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua was
no ordinary Loose Imortal. He definitely has this sort of medicinal
pill, right?” Ning asked frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
looked at Ning, then shook its head. “Immortal Juhua had been alive
for millions of years. His family and friends had died long ago. He
had no need of such pills, and so he didn’t have any of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…” Ning said
hurriedly. “I imagine Immortal Juhua must have left behind quite a
few magic treasures. Give me a magic treasure which has a valuable
comparable to that of an Immortal pill, and I’ll take it and
trade…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he said the
words, Ning knew that he was making a mistake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He cared too much about
his mother’s life, and so he had lost his bearings and equanimity.
Even his words lacked proprietry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Foolishness!” The
old black bull shouted. “You yourself said just now that even a
Wanxiang Adept has only heard of this sort of Immortal pill. You want
to trade for it? With who? You, a Xiantian lifeform, hold a magic
treasure on that level? If you show it off, most likely those
powerful Immortal practitioners will just kill you for it. Trade for
it? If you don’t have enough power, how will you trade?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition! You
haven’t even bound the control talisman, and the only place in the
Aquatic Manor you can enter is just the main palace. You aren’t
even able to enter the other places. On what basis am I supposed to
hand over one of the magic treasures Immortal Juhua left behind?”
The old black bull shook his head. “And what’s more, this isn’t
even my decision to make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not your decision to
make?” Ning was stunned. “Then…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
sighed. “I’m just the spirit of a magic treasure Immortal Juhua
always kept on him! The true controller of this Aquatic Manor is the
Spirit of the Aquatic Manor!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spirit of the
Aquatic Manor?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
explained, “The entire Aquatic Manor was forged by the first
master, who was incredibly mysterious. Even Immortal Juhua himself
felt that this Aquatic Manor has secrets which even he had been
unable to discover. The Spirit of the Aquatic Manor…has been
carrying out the laws and rules set forth by the first master. It
won’t violate the rules in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teleport someone
outside into this place? The Spirit of the Aquatic Manor can do that.
But allow you to go to other places within the manor? Without binding
the Aquatic Manor, that definitely will not be permitted.” The old
black bull said. “It also cannot possibly give you one of Immortal
Juhua’s magic treasures. After all, it is the Spirit of the Aquatic
Manor. It will definitely obey the orders of the first master of the
manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When, for example,
the fourth master died in the outside world, the Spirit of the
Aquatic Manor would at most act to find the next master.” The old
black bull shook his head. “We spirits of magic treasures are
different from you humans. You can change. But we will definitely
respect the will of our master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. Magic
treasures were covered with all sorts of runes and bindings. For
example, some golems which were forged…even long after the death of
their master, the golems would still obey their original orders. The
same was true for dwelling-type magic treasures. After the owner of a
dwelling died, the rules the owner had set down would still be obeyed
by the spirit of the dwelling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he understood
this, Ning felt despair, deep within his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
looked towards Ning. “On the path of Immortals, you will see your
family and friends die of age, one after the other. You will also see
some friends die in battle…you will have to learn how to accept
these things! Go, now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous illusory
bear’s head appeared, engulfing Ning within its mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to West
Prefecture city. Returned to the side of his mother. By now, it was
already late at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yuchi Snow,
lying on the bed, saw her son. Her eyes immediately lit up. “Where
did you go? I couldn’t find you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
hurriedly walked forward, half-kneeling by her side. He held his
mother’s hand. “I went out for a trip. However, I won’t make
any more trips. I’ll accompany you and stay by your side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow gently stroked her
son’s hair. She laughed, “It’s fine. If you are busy, do what
you need to do. Just remember to come visit your mother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded gently, and as he did, he couldn’t help but shed tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing he could
do now was accompany her mother for the final three months. This was
the only filial act he could now do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother had already
fallen asleep. Ji Yichuan and Ji Ning, father and son, were within a
hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
looked towards his father. “It is time to tell me, I think, what
exactly happened in the past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
son, and as he did, he thought of what Blindfish and the others had
said regarding what Ning had done in the mountain. He understood that
his son had grown up. Sighing, he said, That year, your mother was
pregnant. Your mother and I thus decided to return to the Ji clan. At
that time, your maternal uncle was worried, so he escorted and
protected us on the way back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maternal uncle?”
Ning had never before heard that he had an uncle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your uncle’s name
was Yuchi Mount.” Yichuan’s eyes had a hint of memory within
them. “Your uncle was exceedingly intelligent, and he also knew how
to treat others. He had many friends. He had also become a Zifu
Disciple early on. If it weren’t because he wanted to escort myself
and your mother back, your uncle probably would’ve had a chance at
restoring and reestablishing the Yuchi clan. Unfortunately, your
uncle died. He died for the sake of protecting the three of us. All
three of our lives, we have because your uncle gave up his own! This
great debt…is hard to repay!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this,
felt a heavy feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An uncle! Yuchi Mount!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never heard of
this name. This moment was deeply engraved into Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve only heard
that your uncle had a daughter, your maternal cousin. Unfortunately,
I have no idea where your cousin is.” Yichuan shook his head and
sighed. “I’m unable to repay him. Unable to repay him…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly
happened? Who harmed and killed my uncle, and also caused the roots
of her illness?” Ning immediately asked. “Who was it?”
</P>

Chapter 9 - Warmth
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan looked at
his son. After hesitating, he said, “All I can tell you is that he
is a disciple of Snowdragon Mountain, and that his grandfather is a
Summit Master of one of their mountain summits, an individual on the
Primal Daoist level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal Daoist?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He himself is just a
Zifu Disciple and not worthy of being afraid of.” Yichuan shook his
head. “But behind him stands a Primal Daoist…we truly cannot
irriate him! If we struggle against him, the only result will be the
extermination of the entire Ji clan. This is why your mother and I
have never mentioned this, nor said a single word regarding this in
front of you. Ever since that, after your mother and I stealthily
returned to the Ji clan, we have always remained very low-key.
However, most likely that person didn’t hold your mother and I in
any regard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
son. “You are now an adult, and you are very talented. According to
what that Adept Mu said, it is possible that you might one day join
the Raindragon Guards. This is why I have told you these things.
Otherwise…I had planned to never tell you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is he called?”
Ning pursued this line of questioning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you become a
Wanxiang Adept, I will tell you.” Yichuan said. “If I were to
die, your Uncle White will tell you. That year, your Uncle White
risked his life to carry your mother and flee. He saved your life,
and he knew exactly what happened that year.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said frantically,
“You can’t tell me now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What good would it
be if I did tell you?” Yichuan barked. “Will you go seek revenge?
That’s just looking for death! First be patient and endure. After
enduring for a few years, you’ll have calmed down as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember”!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan stared at Ning.
“Don’t let hatred cloud your eyes. In this vast, endless world,
slaughter and hatred is omnipresent. It is guaranteed that you will
one day leave Swallow Mountain. In the vast world outside, those
major schools, clans, and powerful sects are all hard to deal with.
Snowdragon Mountain is nothing more than a millstone for you to
sharpen your blade on, during your path to becoming an Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On your hopes rest
the future of both the Ji clan and the Yuchi clan, understood?”
Yichuan said. “To become famous throughout this boundless world,
and to make Snowdragon Mountain as well as the various other powers
all lower their heads and submit to you; this is what your mother and
I hope to see the most!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your mother and
me proud of you!” Yichuan stared at his son. “My son!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The autumn wind blew.
Dry leaves fell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow was seated
on a long bench in front of her room. The beast fur pelt laid on the
bench was warm and soft. There was a layer of beast fur on Snow’s
body as well. Her face was even more ashen now. She held her son’s
hand, then turned to say towards Yichuan, who was standing next to
her, “Yichuan, bring those beast furs over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yichuan
immediately entered the room, quickly returning while carrying a pile
of beast fur clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
looked at the beast fur clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said, “Your
mother hasn’t had anything to do in recent days, and so she’s
been sewing these beast fur clothes. Every single thread and stitch
is the labor of your mother’s hands.” Seated there, Snow said
softly, “There’s quite a few by now. I only made twelve sets of
clothes in the past three months. They are all suitable for your
current size and stature. In the future, Mother won’t be able to be
by your side, but these clothes will accompany you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes stung,
and he couldn’t refrain from tearing up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t cry.” Snow
gently stroked her son’s face. “I know that soon now, I won’t
be able to last any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!” Ning’s
voice was trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother has
experienced many things in this life.” Snow said slowly. “When I
was an infant, I lived in a large clan with unlimited, glorious
prospects. When I was young, I fled alongside my Father, eventually
meeting your father and adventuring alongside him, braving danger.
Afterwards, I lived ten peaceful years at the Ji clan…in my life,
I’ve had a father who loved me, older brothers and sisters who
loved me, a man who loved me, and you…my most beloved son. I truly
feel content.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s tears were
coming down nonstop. He couldn’t control them, no matter what he
tried. The only thing he could do was continuously hold his mother’s
hand. His mother’s hand was no longer smooth; it had become rough
and leathery, like a dry leaf without any vitality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow said slowly, “In
your body is the bloodline of the Ji clan, as well as the bloodline
of my Yuchi clan. For your mother to have had you…is your mother’s
greatest pride in life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother…” Ning
stared at his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son…in the
future, will you stay for a long time at Serpentwing Lake?” Snow
looked at her son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As an Immortal
practitioner, one had to have a base, after all. West Prefecture City
was too crowded and had too many people. Serpentwing Lake was much
calmer. In addition, Serpentwing Lake had the Aquatic Manor…in the
future, he would indeed often stay at Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I die.” Snow
looked at Yichuan, by her side. “After I am cremated, spread my
ashes over Serpentwing Lake. Yichuan, you won’t be jealous, will
you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s eyes were
moist. He forced out a laugh. “Slightly jealous, actually. However,
after I die, my ashes will also be spread over Serpentwing Lake. By
then, we’ll be together again, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan gently embraced
his wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” Snow’s
voice was growing weaker. She smiled. “I want to look at our Yuchi
clan’s Windwing Evasion. Demonstrate it for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Mother.” Ning
rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind him, out of
nowhere, a pair of wings appeared. And then, forcibly resisting the
pain in his heart, Ning began to execute the Windwing Evasion. Ning
moved about like a giant Roc, gliding through the air, landing atop
of a distant roof, and then with another flash, gliding to another
place. His two wings trembled, and his movements were like that of an
illusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in this moment,
was whole-heartedly focusing on displaying the Windwing Evasion,
because this was the last request of his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning displayed it,
the wind blew against him, like his mother’s hand gently stroking
his face. The touch of the wind was a caress of someone who didn’t
want to let go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s movements
became all the more marvelous, and he seemed to have truly become a
giant Roc, moving all the more faster and all the more freely,
incomparably agile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a giant Roc, a
giant Roc who flew in the skies beyond the Nine Heavens. Ning,
unconsciously, was unconsciously incorporating that insights he had
gained that night into the True Meaning of the Wind, and merging it
with the Windwing Evasion. He even incorporated some deep emotions
into them, like a bird who was longing for the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The great Roc.”
Snow’s eyes lit up as she watched, and she murmured softly, “The
great Roc…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She seemed to have seen
her older brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That tall, stalwart man
who had protected and cherished her since she was young. Her
brother’s usage of the Windwing Evasion was so similar to the way
in which Ning’s Windwing Evasion looked…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother…”
Snow seemed to have returned to the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large courtyard. Her
older brother was there, training in the Windwing Evasion, while her,
as a toddler, was running around calling out, “Big Brother, Big
Brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sis.” That
man, as tall and mighty as a mountain, turned to look at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Sis, Father.”
She saw two more figures, one an elegant middle-aged man with a long
beard, while the other was a seemingly cold and arrogant young woman.
This was her father and her older sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother. Big
Sis. Father…I’m coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child-Snow ran
forward, ran to the side of her older brother, her older sister, and
her father. Together again. They were finally together again…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lying in Yichuan’s
arms, Snow closed her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A peaceful smile was on
her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahh…ahhhh….aaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
Yichuan opened his mouth, making some noise, but wasn’t able to
speak. He tightly clutched his wife, raising his head high, but the
tears still came spilling out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ning came
to a halt. His entire body trembling, he took one step forward after
another, walking towards his mother’s side, then kneeling down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!” Ning
began to sob, a rumbling, heart-broken sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound spread
outside of the courtyard. The servants outside, hearing the sobs of
their young master Ji Ning, filled with such agony, misery, and
sadness, immediately understood that their mistress had already died.
All of them couldn’t help but to lower their heads, their tears
spilling out. They would never forget this benevolent mistress of
theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left West
Prefecture City, going to live on the island in Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the dying
wishes of his mother, he personally scattered her ashes within the
waters of Serpentwing Lake. From that day onwards, Ning gained a new
hobby. He liked to lie down atop a small boat, allowing the boat to
drift freely in the waters of Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lying in the embrace of
his mother. So very warm.

Chapter 10 - Unfathomably Deep
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on like
water, silent and soundless. In the blink of an eye, nearly five
years passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart was the
name which Ji Ning had given this island in the center of the lake.
The island had multiple buildings constructed atop it, and the
formerly desolate island had been made into a beautiful place, like
an unearthly utopia. It was currently at the changing of seasons from
spring to summer, and all sorts of flowers were blooming and
eye-catching. After careful arrangements by some servants, they
appeared all the more beautiful and captivating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Sis Autumn Leaf,
Big Sis Autumn Leaf.” A youth dressed in blue clothes ran over
while shouting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf, who had
been boiling a kettle of tea, turned to look. Laughing, she said,
“Bluestone, your archery lessons have concluded? Did your Master
Blindfish rebuke you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Bluestone
rubbed his head and said resignedly, “How can I not be rebuked?
Each time I practice archery, Master Blindfish will always lecture
me. He’ll also often compare me to Big Bro. But how can I compare
to Big Bro? You know what a genius he is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to treasure
this chance.” Autumn Leaf viewed Bluestone as she might her own
little brother. She said seriously, “Young master himself said that
although Master Blindfish had his dantian destroyed, that just made
him become even more focused on archery…and his archery abilities
have risen to a whole new level. It’s only because Master Blindfish
is living here on Brightheart Island and because the young master
asked him to do so that he is willing to teach you. You need to work
hard. If you master it, it will be a consummate technique for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone immediately
nodded. “I understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone’s life on
Brightheart Island was quite carefree. Ning whole-heartedly treated
him as he would a little brother, and acted towards him as an older
brother would. One could tell how close their relationship was, just
by the way Bluestone addressed him; generally speaking, a younger
individual would address a more senior one as ‘Elder Brother’.
Only someone who grew up together and thus were very close to each
other would use the term ‘Big Bro’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Autumn
Leaf laughed and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Big Bro Ji
Ning?” Bluestone asked. “Training with the sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf laughed,
“He’s not training the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Then he’s
sleeping on Serpentwing Lake.” Bluestone laughed. After having
lived on Serpentwing Lake for five years, he had become well
acquainted with Ning’s habits. Ning, aside from training with the
sword, spent most of his time casually drifting on Serpentwing Lake
aboard a small boat while napping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s
sleeping.” Autumn Leaf turned to look towards that boundless lake
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone couldn’t
help but say, “Originally, I asked Big Bro Ji Ning why he is always
sleeping on Serpentwing Lake. Big Bro just said…he is training. I
don’t get it. How can sleeping atop Serpentwing Lake be training?
But Big Bro Ji Ning’s swordplay really is becoming increasingly
more powerful. Two years ago, Commander Yichuan acknowledged that he
didn’t believe he could beat him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The young
master’s swordplay has reached an unfathomably high level.”
Autumn Leaf sighed. “I once watched the young master train with the
sword, and when I did, I saw some aquatic birds flew over en masse,
then fly around him in a circle for some time, unwilling to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So bizarre!”
Bluestone was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past,
Commander Yichuan would spar once with the young master every year.
Two years ago, when he felt he wouldn’t be able to win, he stopped
coming. Unfortunately, the young master forbade me from watching, so
I don’t know how what the battle scene between the Commander and
the young master was like.” Autumn Leaf felt a hint of longing. In
her eyes, the swordplay of Ji Yichuan had reached a mythical level
long ago, but her young master’s swordplay had apparently reached
an even higher, deeper level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan lived on
Brightheart Island as well. However, it was on the other end of
Brightheart Island. He normally was a solitary, arrogant figure,
forbidding anyone from approaching him, and without any servants
serving him. Only Ning was permitted to go to his residence to
accompany Yichuan, his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m truly curious.
What level has Big Bro reached in swordplay, exactly?” Bluestone’s
eyes were filled with veneration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Autumn Leaf
suddenly looked towards the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Bluestone
turned to look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distance, a
single boat could be faintly seen. At first, a look of delight
appeared on Bluestone’s face as he took it for the boat on which
Ning slept, but when he looked more closely…he saw that this was a
large ship, the one which often delivered people to and from the
shores of the lake. After all, quite a few people were now living on
Brightheart Island, with nearly a hundred servants being present.
Large amounts of food would often be delivered to the island, and
some outsiders would come visit. Naturally, they had to have this
ferry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the ferry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a group of
youths atop the ferry, and they were chatting and joking amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Central
Prefecture Lord told us to come pay our respects to Ji Ning.” A
big, burly-chested youth had a hint of disgruntlement in his eyes.
“We are the Central Prefecture of the Ji clan. We are far more
powerful than the other four Prefectures! The six of us are the most
powerful members of the younger generation of the Ji clan of the
Central Prefecture. To have us come spar with this Ji Ning is one
thing, but he actually said that we were to come ‘pay our respect’
and have this Ji Ning ‘provide guidance to us’? And that we had
to be reverential towards him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
A handsome looking youth said. “The Central Prefecture Lord stated
that we must be respectful and that we must address him as young
master Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, fine. Young
master Ji Ning.” The big youth couldn’t refrain from adding,
“That’s fine for the rest of us, but Ji Mo, you are the number
one, ultimate genius amongst the younger generation of our Ji clan of
the Central Prefecture. You became a Xiantian expert at age fifteen,
and reached the level of mastery long ago in the ultimate technique
of our Ji clan, the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords]. That Ji
Ning…although that young master Ji Ning became a Xiantian expert a
few years earlier than you, the two of you will simply spar at most.
How can you be asked to ‘pay your respects’ to him and have him
‘provide guidance’ to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Mo.” A black
haired woman said. “Tongzhan speaks the truth. The instructions the
Central Prefecture Lord gave us, none of us will openly oppose, but
in our hearts, none of us truly submit either. We are the most
talented youths of the Central Prefecture, while that Ji Ning…that
young master Ji Ning is only the most talented youth of the West
Prefecture. No matter how much of a genius he is, at most he’ll be
a bit more powerful than us. How can he be qualified to have us ‘go
pay our respects’ to him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, all of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth’s
gaze was like water. He swept everyone with his gaze, and the other
five youths all fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Mo was, without
question, the number one figure in the younger generation of the Ji
clan of the Central Prefecture. In addition, ever since he had been
young, he had followed by the side of Granny Shadow, and thus Mo’s
status was all the more unique…many people were certain that Mo
would be the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the Central
Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You all know that I
follow Granny Shadow.” Mo said slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Looks of
awe appeared in the eyes of the other five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the entire Ji clan,
there were two people who stood at the very pinnacle of the clan. One
was the Patriarch, Ji Ninefire! The other was Granny Shadow! Granny
Shadow was the sibling and younger sister of Ninefire, an old granny
who had also lived for nearly four centuries. But, without question,
she had been at the Zifu Disciple level for three hundred years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them were
the two publicly acknowledged Zifu Disciples of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for whether or not
there were other Zifu Disciples hidden in the shadows, that was hard
to say. A clan would naturally want to hide some cards up their
sleeves, interchanging truth and lies. This led to longevity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granny Shadow
personally taught me swordplay.” Mo said softly. “My swordplay,
compared to Granny Shadow’s, is unimaginably weaker. Do you know
why the six of us have been sent by the Central Prefecture Lord to
Serpentwing Lake to pay our respects to Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear the North
Prefecture, the East Prefecture, and the South Prefecture had already
sent their younger generation members over to pay their respects to
young master Ji Ning, and so our Central Prefecture sent the six of
us as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Mo shook his head
lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Central
Prefecture is the root of the Ji clan. The Patriarch and Granny
Shadow are both within our Central Prefecture.” Mo said. “The
territory that our Central Prefecture takes up is the greatest, and
the number of Xiantian experts we have far surpasses the number the
other four prefectures have. Even the Crimson Guards are stationed in
our Central Prefecture. Why, then, must our Central Prefecture act in
the same manner as the other prefectures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what’s the
reason?” They all looked towards Mo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mo said softly, “The
reason is, one year ago, Granny Shadow made a trip here to
Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granny Shadow came
to Serpentwing Lake?” The other five youths instantly began to
think of many possibilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mo said, “The
Patriarch had once praised young master Ji Ning highly, saying that
in the future, he would definitely be the number one expert of our Ji
clan! Granny Shadow thus decided to come here to Serpentwing Lake to
personally see what sort of ability this Ji Ning had…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did Granny
Shadow say?” The five youths looked expectantly at Mo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mo’s eyes had a very
strange light to them. He said slowly, “After Granny Shadow
returned, I repeatedly asked her how I was in comparison to young
master Ji Ning. The only thing Granny Shadow would say was that it
was hard to compare. That it was hard to compare. I kept on asking
her what level of swordplay this young master Ji Ning had reached,
and Granny Shadow just replied with a single phrase; ‘unfathomably
deep’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfathomably deep!”
The five youths were stunned. For even Granny Shadow to say such a
thing…how terrifying was Ji Ning’s swordplay?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, time to
disembark.” A sailor said loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the six of
them look over. The ferry had already neared the shore, and from
afar, various buildings arose within their vision, an amazingly
beautiful sight. The six of them couldn’t help but sigh in
amazement in their hearts, while Ji Mo’s eyes lit up. “This is
where Ji Ning lives?”

Chapter 11 - Ji Ning’s Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six youths from the
Ji clan’s Central Prefecture disembarked. From the island, four
figures walked over, the leader being a beautiful woman dressed in
simple, plain clothes. By her side was a youth dressed in blue, while
two Crimson Guards followed them from the side. There were a total of
a hundred Crimson Guards on the island, which Ji Ninefire had
especially stationed here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you are
Manager Autumn Leaf.” Ji Mo, the leader of the six youths, extended
his hand, and within it, a beast skin appeared which had some words
written atop it. “We are here at the commands of our Central
Prefecutre Lord, and we have come to pay our respects to young master
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Autumn Leaf
accepted the beast skin parchment and glanced at it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the various
matters pertaining to Brightheart Island were under Autumn Leaf’s
control, and she had been appointed as the General Manager by Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf carefully
read through the beast skin parchment, then lifted her head and
smiled. “We had already received the news previously and had been
informed that six outstanding talents of the Central Prefecture were
coming. Everyone, please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have come to pay
our respects to young master Ji Ning. Might I ask when young master
Ji Ning will be able to see us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While following Autumn
Leaf, the six youths asked this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf just said,
“Everyone, don’t be hasty. You will definitely see the young
master today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the six youths
were led to a quiet, reclusive residence which was specially used for
receiving guests. Autumn Leaf instructed a pair of maidservants,
“These six are our esteemed guests from the Central Prefecture.
Take good care of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The two
maidservants acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” Autumn
Leaf looked at the six of them and laughed. “Once our young master
has time, I will definitely come inform the six of you. Everyone, you
must be tired from your journey. You can rest here for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Autumn
Leaf led Bluestone and the others away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, people of high
status really are troublesome!” The tall, muscular youth, Ji
Tongzhan, was so angry his eyes bulged. “What could this young
master Ji Ning possibly be worrying about, living here in such a
secluded, quiet little lake island? This female manager even said
‘when our young master has free time’. Jeeze…they really hold
us in no regard at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Central
Prefecture ordered someone to convey the letter long ago to inform
them of our arrival. It’s one thing for young master Ji Ning to not
come welcome us, but he won’t even let us know when he will meet
with us, and instead just has us wait here like fools?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These youths were all
the talented, favored sons of heaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they believed
that Ji Ning was one level stronger than them, they were still people
of the same age. For them to be slighted like this…they were rather
unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Endure it!” Ji Mo
just sat there and called out to them quietly. “We are here to pay
our respects. Thus, wait here obediently for young master Ji Ning to
summon us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re just
discontent, that’s all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Everyone
talks about how powerful young master Ji Ning is, but none of us have
ever met him. He’s only sixteen years old. How powerful can he be?”
These youths all chatted amongst themselves. Even Ji Mo, seated
there, in his bones had the untamed arrogance inherent to all
geniuses. What one heard didn’t matter. What one saw was what
really mattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Until he personally
witnessed Ji Ning’s abilities, in Mo’s heart, he too had a small
ball of fiery anger that was currently smoldering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sun had already
set, and the night fog had covered the entire western horizons. The
setting sun’s red glow covered the earth, causing the surface of
Serpentwing Lake to appear as beautiful as a painting. Far away on
the surface of the lake in this ‘painting’, a small boat was
swaying as the water pushed it forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the young
master’s boat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maidservants had
noticed long ago, and they had immediately informed Manager Autumn
Leaf. Autumn Leaf and Bluestone quickly arrived on the beach, staring
at that distant little boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was comfortably
lying there, his eyes shut. The lake around him was completely
silent, as silent as a painting. Suddenly, he could vaguely sense the
auras of many people in the distance, and as he did, his eyelids
twitched, then opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m here.” Ning
immediately stood up, stretching lazily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was still dressed in
those beast fur clothes. However, these were formed from the
transformation of a protective magic-treasure…after all, he only
had a few sets of beast fur clothes which his mother had sown for
him. If he always wore them, they would eventually be ruined. Ning
couldn’t bear for that to happen, and so he stored them away.
However, he still changed the appearance of his armor-type magic
treasure into beast furs. He felt the most comfortable dressed in
them anyhow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Splash.” The speed
of the boat suddenly increased rapidly, and it broke through the
waves, advancing at high speed, charging towards the distant island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the little boat, smiling as he greeted his Autumn Leaf and Bluestone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the boat drew near
the island, it actually disappeared. Ning walked atop the waves,
arriving at the beach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf laughed as she went to welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Bro Ji Ning.”
Bluestone immediately ran over as well, saying excitedly, “Today,
six youths of the Central Prefecture came. They act so high and
mighty and look down on people so much, they might as well have their
eyes growing from the tops of their heads.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning seemed to have
thought of something. “Oh? This is that group of the most talented
youths of the Central Prefecture?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Autumn
Leaf nodded. “They arrived at noon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have them come to
the sword training field.” Ning laughed. “Since the Central
Prefecture had them come, their intention is for me to give these
youths a sound beating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ll go
invite them right now.” Autumn Leaf immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword training
field.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a wide area of
more than three hundred meters, locate in front of Ning’s
residence. This was the place where Ning usually trained with the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already drank
five bottles of water. It’s almost night. He’s finally willing to
meet us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning has
been made out to be a near legendary figure. I wonder what he’s
actually like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six men and women
spoke to each other softly, all clearly quite excited. They were
filled with boundless curiosity towards this legendary young master
Ji Ning. Autumn Leaf led the way from up front, and they soon arrived
at the sword training field. “The young master is there. You can go
there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Mo and the other six
looked over carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distance, a
youth dressed in beast furs could be seen standing there. From his
appearance, he wasn’t too tall; he was still at the same height he
had been when he had broken through to become a Xiantian expert.
Only, for some reason…just by standing there, Ning seemed to have
become one with the surrounding area, as though the entire scene was
one in a painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beast fur clad
youth suddenly turned, leaving that earlier state of seeming to be a
person in a painting. He seemed to have transformed into an Adept.
Actually, before this, Ning had fused his soul with the world and was
meditating on the ‘Dao’! Ever since he had moved to live on
Serpentwing Lake, especially after he began to rest there on that
little boat and casually drift on the surface of the lake each day,
his entire soul had become incomparably peaceful and calm, and
incomparably close to nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time,
Ning’s swordplay had advanced by leaps and bounds. His level had
risen nonstop, to the point which by now, Ning was able to infuse the
‘Dao’ he had learned casually and freely into his techniques.
Although there was no way he could completely absorb himself into the
Dao, like he had that night by the pool, to train in such a
manner…was already inconceivable. This caused his swordplay to
reach a truly astonishing level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, come
over.” Ning spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mo and the others all
looked at this young master Ji Ning. His features were handsome and
delicate, like a youth’s. Only, he had a natural, reserved aura
about him, an aura which one could only achieve after constantly
improving upon one’s mind and spirit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, young
master Ji Ning.” Mo and the rest of the six all walked forward and
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the
most talented youth of the Central Prefecture is Ji Mo. Which of you
is Ji Mo?” Ning said directly. Since he was to give them a beating,
he might as well just pick the strongest one. This would be more
effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me.” Mo said, his
eyes fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “What do
you train in?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Melody of Ten
Thousand Swords]!” Mo’s eyes held great confidence within them.
“I just mastered it. I hope young master Ji Ning will provide me
with some guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mastered?” Ning
nodded. “The [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] is an ultimate
technique which guards our entire clan, and is extremely marvelous.
Take out your sword and use your most powerful sword attack against
me. Let me see exactly how well you use the [Melody of Ten Thousand
Swords].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Mo drew
out his icy longsword. The longsword had some faint runes atop it.
Clearly, this was a weapon-type magic treasure. Mo shouted out,
“Young master Ji Ning, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the sword
transformed into countless illusions, all of which appeared and swept
forward towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
watching. Just as those countless sword illusions enveloped him, he
stretched out a finger and lightly tapped. “Break!” Immediately,
all of the sword illusions vanished, with the true form of the
longsword appearing. Tapped by Ning’s finger, the longsword which
had flying towards Ning at high speed suddenly flew away on its own
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…” Mo
stared in shock, his eyes wide. The other five youths were completely
stunned as well. Just by relying on his finger, he was able to flick
away a sword which contained the power of the world? And they didn’t
feel that Ning’s finger moved very quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible…my sword…?” Mo didn’t dare believe it. “Your force
clearly wasn’t that great. How could you instantly guide my force
away and make my sword fly out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me ask you
this.” Ning barked. “What techniques does the [Melody of Ten
Thousand Swords] have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mo hurriedly said, “The
[Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] has three techniques in total. The
‘One Sword, Ten Thousand Shadows’ stance, the ‘Ten Thousand
Swords Become One’, and the ‘Melody of Ten Thousand Swords’.
Amongst them, the ‘Melody of Ten Thousand Swords’ is the most
powerful lkilling technique. What I used just now was that most
powerful technique, the ‘Melody of Ten Thousand Swords’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Melody of
Ten Thousand Swords…Melody of Ten Thousand Swords…the most
important part of it isn’t the ‘ten thousand swords’, it is in
the word ‘melody’!” In recent years, Ji Ninefire had especially
arranged for people to send over the various sword and saber
techniques the Ji clan possessed, and Ning had flipped through all of
them. At Ning’s current level, he himself could develop techniques
on par with these skills. All he had to do was to get an
understanding of their essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Melody?” Mo was
awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch carefully.”
Ning pointed with his finger, and a ray of sword light solidified,
slicing through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, the sky
was filled with sword images, and the countless sword images appeared
everywhere, seemingly quite similar to the ‘Melody of Ten Thousand
Swords’ which Mo had just used. But at the same time, these
countless, densely clustered sword shadows seemed to form into
multiple musical notes, each of which had their own differences.
These countless sword shadows actually formed into a single,
high-pitched song.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Passion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celebration!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Mo and the other six
were completely stunned. They could actually sense a sort of joy
emanating from those countless sword shadows, which seemed to have a
life of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch now.” Ning
shot out another ray of sword light, once more forming into countless
blurry sword shadows. Those countless sword shadows affected each
other, each of which seemed to be independent and yet which linked up
with the others…the countless musical notes transformed into a
song, but this song was filled with boundless killing intent, a
killing intent which caused their courage to turn cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single sword
shadow seemed like a soldier, and the countless soldiers were
bellowing while charging forward, covering the skies and filling the
skies with their killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Mo and the
other five were completely ashen. They couldn’t help but
unconsciously retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you see?” The
sword light from Ning’s finger vanished. “This is the ‘melody’.
The soul of the entire sword technique! It doesn’t matter what type
of soul it is; only with a soul will your ten thousand swords truly
become one, and truly become the astonishing sword melody!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five felt
utterly astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Mo, who had
an extremely deep level of accomplishment with regards to the [Melody
of Ten Thousand Swords], he was thoroughly convinced and subdued.
With a ‘bang’ sound, he immediately knelt down in front of Ning.
“Please accept me as your disciple!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - The World Suddenly Changes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Mo had
sincerely asked to be allowed to take Ji Ning as his master, how
could Ning accept? After all, for a sword technique to have a ‘soul’,
what was required was an understanding of the Dao. This wasn’t
something that could simply be taught! Ning next provided guidance to
the others, one by one. The attitudes of these youths had immediately
become incomparably humble. All of them raised issues which had
normally puzzled them, and Ning naturally was able to very easily
resolve them. Just in terms of sword technique alone, there was no
one within the Ji clan who could compare to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent four full
hours providing guidance to them, and afterwards, Ning sent them off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go back and spend
some time pondering these things. I won’t keep you here any
further.” After providing guidance, Ning himself left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six youths just
watched longingly as Ning left. How they wished that Ning could spend
some more time giving them guidance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position on his bed mattress, training. Elemental energy was
constantly surging towards him, entering his body and liquefying into
Ki. After a long time, when he sensed that his dantian had become
somewhat swollen, Ning came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely, within
a few more months, I will be able to establish my ‘Violet Palace’
as a Ki Refiner.” Ning said to himself. “However, to reach the
Zifu Disciple level as a practitioner of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens] will require me to reach the seventh level of
that art. I wonder how long it will be before I reach it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, he had already
reached the peak of power as a Xiantian lifeform as both a Ki Refiner
and as a Fiendgod Body Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The technique he was
using to train as a Ki Refiner was an ordinary technique of the Ji
clan, known as the [Water Element Art]. The quality of the ki
provided by those who trained in this technique was fairly poor, but
it was easy to breakthrough to become a Zifu Disciple! Given Ning’s
current level of understanding regarding the Dao, once the
accumulated ki in his body reached a certain level, he could rely on
it to immediately establish his Zifu ‘Violet Palace’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Water Element
Art] is a very ordinary technique.” Ning said to himself. “It can
only allow a person to train to the Zifu Disciple level. After
establishing the ‘Violet Palace’, I’ll have to acquire a new Ki
Refining technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The further a Ki
Refining technique allowed one to progress, the more valuable it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
I must find a more formidable Ki Refining technique.” Ning pondered
to himself. “The [Water Element Art] is, in the end, a very
superficial technique. If I continue to use this sort of superficial
technique in the future…most likely, my development in Ki Refining
will come to a halt at the Wanxiang level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the difference
between a high class technique and a low class technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A high class,
hard-to-learn technique was hard to start training in, but it allowed
one to begin slowly walking in the right direction, constantly
advancing on firm footing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for low class
techniques, they made it easy for one to establish the ‘Violet
Palace’, and if one went all out, one had the chance to reach the
Wanxiang Adept level. But…to become a Primal Daoist? There was no
hope of it whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan, after all,
was a fairly low level clan. It didn’t have any high class Fiendgod
Body Refining techniques or Ki Refining techniques. It did have the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique, which was
unique in that it was widely spread throughout the lands. The other
Ki Refining techniques the clan possessed were all very poor; this
was why the likes of Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow had been training
for nearly four centuries, but were still at the Zifu Disciple stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to go out
adventuring.” Ning was rather eager. “I’ll wait to establish my
Violet Palace first. By then, I will be better equipped to protect
myself. The little power I have right now is still rather
insufficient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew his own power
quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Ki Refiner, he was
at the peak Xiantian level; however, half a year ago, he had already
become capable of executing the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], and his attack power should have reached the peak
Zifu Disciple level! His weakness was that his ki was used up too
quickly, and that he wasn’t able to fight for as long as most Zifu
Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Body Refiner, he
had reached the peak Xiantian level in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens]. He was already comparable to early, ordinary Zifu
Disciple level Fiendgod Body Refiners! Given his current lifeforce,
even if his skull was pierced through, he still wouldn’t die!
Although his attack power was somewhat weaker than that of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], once battle truly began, his body
was still the more powerful aspect of the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] is incomparably sharp…” Ning said to
himself. “If I were to encounter a Zifu Disciple who is an Fiendgod
Body Refiner and whose body is incomparably durable, even if I can
chop through his body with a ray of sword light, his body would
quickly heal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against Zifu level
Ki Refiners, I can give them a good fight, even if they are peak Zifu
Disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But against Fiendgod
Body Refiners…I can deal with early stage ones, but anything
stronger than that will be hard.” Ning knew this very well. “I
wonder what I need to do to breakthrough in the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Transform Yin and Yang…Blood-Drop
Rebirth…what must I do to achieve this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not dying when one’s
head was cut through wasn’t much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he could reach
the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
he would possess the ability to regenerate himself from a single drop
of blood! Life energy as powerful as this made it extremely hard for
other Zifu Ki Refiners to deal with him. To kill an Fiendgod Body
Refiner expert…how hard it was! The only way was to slowly exhaust
the expert of all his divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blood-Drop Rebirth.”
Ning was filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the current
Ning was already an absolute monster. For attack, he had the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]! He had also become a peak Xiantian in the
number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique, and even Zifu Disciples
would find it hard to kill him! It was hard for others to kill him,
but by relying on the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], he could
kill others from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not enough, not
enough. If Bei Zishan’s insect swarms were ten times greater in
number, they would still be able to kill me through exhausting my
power..” Ning didn’t dare to be the slightest bit incautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still remembered
what the old black bull had told him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That he was not to
underestimate any Immortal practitioner! You are formidable, but
aren’t others also in possession of formidable techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes,
beginning to visualize the [Nuwa Painting]. The visualization of the
Nuwa Painting was something he continuously did. The reason he was
now able to execute the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] was primarily thanks to the power of his divine will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sky slowly
brightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seated quietly in
the lotus position on his bed, suddenly opened his eyes, frowning as
he carefully reached out with his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it just me?”
Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” A surge
of incomparably powerful elemental energy rippled outwards, washing
through Serpentwing Lake in an instant like a huge, roaring wave.
This enormously powerful elemental ripple caused Ning’s face to
change. Swish! He flew straight out from the window, flying to the
crown of a large tree and staring outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northward.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the tree’s crown, staring into the distant north. The incomparably
savage elemental ripple had come from the north.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like the ripple
caused by a stone being thrown into a pool of water. In a distant
point to the north, incomparably powerful natural, elemental ripples
were being cast out in every direction….one ripple after another
surged outwards, sweeping out for thousands of kilometers, constantly
broadcasting outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
elemental energy ripple.” Ning was amazed and stunned. “To be
able to arouse such a powerful elemental aura…the rate at which I
absorb elemental energy when training, compared to this ripple, is
like the light of a firefly compared to the glorious splendor of the
sun and the moon. What is going on? What has caused such a powerful
ripple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From another place
within the island, a figure flew out, leaping across the tops of some
trees and buildings, advancing at high speed. Soon, the figure
reached Ning’s side. It was Ji Yichuan, clad in a white beast fur
jacket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
looked at his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You felt it as
well.” Yichuan looked solemnly towards the north.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The north.”
Ning nodded, then said with incomparable solemnity, “A terrifying
elemental energy ripple. It was inconceivably strong. Given what I
sensed, if I’m not mistaken, this elemental energy ripple should
have originated from thousands of kilometers to the north.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded as well.
“I didn’t sense it as clearly as you did, but the impression I
received was essentially the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, what on
earth happened to cause such a powerful elemental energy ripple?”
Ning hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
possibilities.” Yichuan said. “It is possible that a duel between
Immortals has caused these elemental ripples. It is also possible
that an ancient relic site has suddenly emerged! It’s also possible
that an Immortal magic treasure has revealed itself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
“Then our Ji clan…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The land thousands of
kilometers to the north remained the territory of the Ji clan. The
West Prefecture City of the Ji clan was to the southwest of the
Central Prefecture City. The region thousands of kilometers to the
north was one of the centermost areas of the entire Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter which of
the possibilities it is, it isn’t good for our Ji clan.” Yichuan
said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face became
ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A battle between
Immortals? An emergence of a relic site? An Immortal magic treasure
revealing itself? Other unknown possibilities? How could the Ji clan,
whose most powerful experts were only on the Zifu level, possibly
withstand these things?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s take a
look.” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning was
incomparably worried as well. At the same time, he immediately used
his ki to send his voice to Autumn Leaf, who was staying in a room
not too far from his own. “Autumn Leaf, I’m heading out. You are
in charge of Brightheart Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flew into the
air at high speed, then running across the waves, quickly transformed
into blurred rays of light which advanced to the north at high speed.
At their level, when they put all their energy into their footwork
techniques, they were actually rather faster than even the Azure
Firebird, and many times faster than ordinary mounts.

Chapter 13 - Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand kilometers
south of the City of Ten Thousand Swords, the only commandery city of
the Grand Xia Dynasty which was under control of the Ji clan. This
place was a desolate mountain forest, completely ordinary and
unremarkable! However, in the air above this desolate mountain
forest, an enormous vortex had appeared! This was a rainbow vortex,
thirty thousand meters high, its influence omnidirectional.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous rainbow
vortex was wildly pulling in the surrounding elemental energy.
Because the collection of elemental energy was too vigorous, and the
density of the collected energy was too high, the swirling pressure
compacted it to the point where a rainbow of colors had appeared.
This enormous elemental vortex…agitated the elemental aura in the
surrounding area to surge outward in waves, causing those powerful
ripples to broadcast in every direction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This elemental vortex
was shaped like a sharp awl, pointed directly downwards towards the
ground. Clearly, the origin of this natural vortex was directly
located within the ground region of that desolate mountain forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whooosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A male figure appeared
in the air, amidst the vibrating elemental energy. This man had long,
loose hair, and wore black, traditional robes which had a strange
beast embroidered onto them. He wore a crested crown on his head, and
his face was as pale as jade. He naturally emanated a lofty aura, and
his gaze was directed downwards, staring towards that origin point
which the swirling, enormous elemental vortex was ‘pointing’
towards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The black
robed man nodded slightly. “This Anomaly…it should be that
someone has reached the Void stage and become an Earth Immortal! I
wonder if which side this new Earth Immortal belongs to…this is
Swallow Mountain. The number of large tribes, schools, and sects
located near Swallow Mountain can be counted on one hand. The closest
one is the Heavenly Saint Sect! Can it be that one of the Primal
Daoists of the Heavenly Saint Sect has made a breakthrough? But if it
were one of the Primal Daoists of the Heavenly Saint Sect, there
should be protectors and guardians nearby.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While pondering, he
continued to stand there, watching quietly in mid-air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The appearance of an
Anomaly such as this meant that this person had already succeeded. It
would be too late to stop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous elemental
vortex suddenly collapsed, causing the nearby elemental energy to
violently tremble, but soon everything returned to normal. Right at
the moment that the elemental vortex collapsed…a man appeared out
of nowhere, garbed in fiery red robes and carrying three greatswords
on his back. His two temples had hints of white hair, and he swept
the area with a lightning-like gaze, soon noticing the black robed
man who stood in the distance in mid-air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations, my
fellow Daoist, for having returned to the Void and become an Earth
Immortal!” The black robed man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask who you
are, fellow Daoist?” The man carrying the three greatswords on his
back asked immediately. He didn’t dare to be discourteous either;
he knew that the Anomaly generated by his breakthrough had lasted for
only a short period of time. For someone to be able to sense it and
also hurry over in such a short period of time…that was no ordinary
feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black robed man
laughed. “I am Northmont Skyfall! And you, fellow Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red robed man,
hearing this, was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Throughout the
Stillwater Commandery, this surname was known to represent the most
exalted force present; the Marquis of Stillwater! The Marquis of
Stillwater was of the Northmont clan! Ever since the time when the
Grand Xia Dynasty unified the world and bequeathed marquisdoms, the
Northmont clan and the Marquis of Stillwater had been in control of
this region. Their roots were extremely deep, far more so than any of
the other forces present in Stillwater Commandery. The only
organization capable of competing for supremacy in this region was
the Raindragon Guard, which represented the Grand Xia Dynasty itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of delight was
on the red robed man’s face as he said hurriedly, “So it is
Immortal Laxiao! I was wondering who within the Stillwater Commandery
could instantly notice this elemental Anomaly, and had guessed that
only the Northmont clan of Stillwater was capable of this! I didn’t
expect that the famous, world-renowned Immortal Skyfall had come in
person. Compared to you, Immortal Skyfall, I’m just a junior. I
imagine that you, Immortal Skyfall, have never even heard of my name.
However, I did have a nickname in the past; Daoist Firedragon.
Immortal Skyfall, have you heard of me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Immortal Skyfall
who stood before him was a Loose Immortal who had lived for tens of
thousands of years. The longer Loose Immortals lived, the more
terrifying they became. Although he was confident in being able to
stay alive if Immortal Skyfall attacked, he knew that in terms of
power, as a new Earth Immortal, he was probably a level weaker in
strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Firedragon?”
Immortal Skyfall was briefly startled. He truly hadn’t heard of
this figure before. He immediately said, “I truly haven’t heard
of you. I imagine that prior to this, fellow Daoist, you weren’t
present in the Stillwater Commandery region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I was a
Wanxiang Adept, I went to the East Sea.” The red robed man
immediately said. “While adventuring in the East Sea, I suddenly
broke through to the Primal stage, and acquired the nickname of
Daoist Firedragon. Because I was in the distant, remote East Sea…it
isn’t strange that you have never heard of me, Immortal Skyfall. A
hundred years ago, I returned once more to this region. Perhaps
because I felt very moved upon returning to my ancient homeland, I
had a sudden feeling and thus immediately found a place to start
training. I sealed myself into a training cave for a hundred years,
and today, I just made my breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Skyfall
nodded. “So that’s how it is. Daoist Firedragon, might I ask
where your homeland was?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I myself am from
Stillwater Commandery.” Daoist Firedragon said. “Unfortunately,
my clan was eliminated long ago. I won’t lie to you, Immortal
Skyfall; the purpose of this return of mine was to seek out my
clansmen and rebuild my clan, and also to avenge my clan and execute
this blood feud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Immortal Skyfall laughed clearly. “So Daoist Firedragon, you are of
my Stillwater Commandery? My Stillwater Commandery now has yet
another Immortal. I truly am overjoyed! It is karmic which brings the
two of us together, Daoist Firedragon. As for your matters, you can
consider them to be the matters of the Marquis Palace of Stillwater.
There’s no need for us to continue speaking here. Come, let’s go
to Stillwater City. My clan’s Lord Marquis will definitely receive
you, fellow Daoist, with the greatest of ceremony.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll obey
your request rather than standing on ceremony.” Daoist Firedragon
laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Immortal was someone
worthy of befriending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Firedragon was
in no rush to join a side right now. He had to see what sort of
offers would be made to him, after all. He knew very well that in the
end, this boundless world belonged to the Grand Xia Dynasty. If he
wanted to rise and to make his clan grow and prosper, it was best if
he either joined with the forces of the Grand Xia Dynasty, or if he
joined with the forces of the various Marquises, who had deep roots
in their respective areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Immortal Skyfall stretched his hand out, taking Immortal
Firedragon’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They disappeared from
mid-air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The City of Ten
Thousand Swords was the base and foundation of the Ji clan. Ji
Ninefire and Granny Shadow both lived within this city. What’s
more, that elemental Anomaly originated from just a thousand or so
kilometers from the city; given their speed, the two of them
naturally soon arrived at the desolate mountain forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be right
here.” Ninefire and Granny Shadow, along with an old servant, were
currently standing atop a large magic calabash gourd. Ninefire was
staring down at the desolate mountain forest. He said, “But why is
it that it seems as though this mountain wilderness is very calm.
There’s nothing special here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t see
anything either.” Granny Shadow and the old servant were watching
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Brother.”
Granny Shadow said in her hoarse voice. “I’ll go down and take a
look. Ah Xing, you stay here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress, let me
go.” The old servant let out a hoarse whisper, and then transformed
into a ray of light, descending towards the desolate mountain forest
below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow was
frantic. “Ah Xing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.” Ninefire
looked at Granny Shadow. “This old servant of yours truly is
devoted to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earlier, violent
ripples of elemental energy clearly involved a major affair. The
first person to investigate thus would be taking on great risk.
Ninefire, as the Patriarch of the Ji clan, was the true pillar of the
clan and thus couldn’t be risked. This was why Granny Shadow was
about to go down, but the old servant went down first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the entire world,
Ah Xing is the most loyal person to me.” Granny Shadow said gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blur from below rose
into the skies, landing atop the flying gourd. It was that old
servant with unbound hair and dressed in beast furs. Ninefire
immediately asked, “How is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a large
amount of elemental ore below.” The old servant said in a low
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A large amount of
elemental ore?” Ninefire frowned. “How much?” Elemental ore
contained gems which possessed elemental energy. However, the amount
of elemental energy which people were able to absorb each day was
limited, generally speaking. At a certain point in time, it would be
impossible to absorb any more. Ordinary elemental gems were thus used
to set up formations, or they might be useful in creating golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But training? They
weren’t very useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, some
rare natural treasures existed that didn’t place much of a strain
on the body, but which when ingested could provide power comparable
to ten or even a hundred years of training. In addition, amongst
elemental stones, there were high quality ones which had special
effects. The elemental energy within high class elemental stones was
very pure; when absorbing the energy within them, the body wasn’t
placed under much strain, and thus by using them, in a single day,
one would be able to make gains comparable to ten days of normal
training. However, the rate of consumption of stones for training in
such a way was significant as well! It wasn’t so bad if one only
occasionally used a piece or two of high class elemental stones, but
if an Immortal practitioner wanted to use them for long term
training, one would have to buy thousands or more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wasn’t something
which the Ji clan was capable of affording.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very many. Very
many.” The old servant said solemnly. “It should be an elemental
ore mine. In addition, my superficial scan turned up high quality
elemental stones already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? An elemental
ore mine? With high class elemental stones?” Ninefire was instantly
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An elemental ore mine?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
certain special environments would produce elemental ore mines. But
of course, one was also capable of intentionally forming an elemental
ore mine. For the sake of making his breakthrough, Immortal
Firedragon had to have enough elemental energy present for him to
use. Thus, he was willing to pay a high price to set up a grand
formation which drew in the surrounding elemental energy. Day after
day, month after month, an elemental ore mine was formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elemental ore mine?”
Granny Shadow revealed a look of excitement as well. “Our Ji clan
is about to suddenly rise to prominence?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look first.” Ninefire suppressed his excitement. He immediately
collected his magic gourd, and the three of them descended at high
speed into the desolate mountain forest, diving into the ground to
investigate.

Chapter 14 - A Large Scale Mine
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sky slowly grew
brighter. Ji Ning and his father, Ji Yichuan, were currently moving
at top speed, moving towards the origin of those elemental ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I have never
competed against Father in speed before. Father is actually this
fast?” Ning was extremely surprised. His divine body was comparable
to that of early-stage Zifu-level Fiendgod practitioners. Given that
he also had the Windwing Evasion technique, one could imagine how
fast he was. Even when he didn’t use his wing-type magic treasure,
he was still very fast…but his father, Ji Yichuan, was able to move
at the same pace as him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, your
footwork technique…? Can it be that you have established your
Violet Palace?” Ning use his ki to ask mentally while hurrying
forward. He didn’t realize that when the disaster had occurred,
aside from the injuries suffered by the Yuchi siblings, his own
father, Yichuan, had been heavily wounded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to ask.”
Yichuan clearly didn’t want to discuss it. “This speed is already
my maximum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he were to use his
wing-type magic treasures, he would still be able to increase his
speed by quite a bit, but there was no need.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two moved forward
like blurs of smoke. Moving at such an astonishing speed, this
distance of thousands of kilometers was traversed in just a single
hour! Their speed was completely at that of the Zifu Disciple level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be in this
region.” Ning came to a halt, standing atop the crown of a large,
ancient tree. He stared towards a mountain forest. “The ripple
originated from no more than three hundred kilometers away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should be.”
Yichuan nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a close
look.” The two looked about carefully as they ran forward atop the
trees. Soon, Yichuan jumped directly down into the ground, emerging
shortly afterwards. “Ning, come over here.” Ning immediately
leapt down, moving like a ray of light to the grassy area where
Yichuan was currently standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly asked,
“What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are elemental
stones underground.” Yichuan said solemnly. “And this should be
an extremely rich elemental ore mine. I’ve even noticed high
quality elemental stones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“High quality
elemental stones?” Ning was shocked as well. “The area under the
control of my Ji clan actually has high quality elemental stones?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This vein of
elemental stones is extremely rich, and there are very few other ores
mixed in. Still, because these are elemental stones…there’s no
way to traverse through them using ground-tunneling arts.” Yichuan
said. “Just by using ground-tunneling arts, I was only able to
burrow to a depth of a hundred and fifty meters, which is where the
elemental ore mine begins. Further down…is an extremely rich vein
of elemental ore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
Ground-tunneling techniques allowed one to pass through ordinary dirt
and rocks, but some special materials were completely impassable.
Elemental stones, for example, were impassable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a hundred
kilometers away, a golden light suddenly rose into the skies,
emitting an ear-piercing sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yichuan both
turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The golden arrow of
the Ji clan!” Ning and Yichuan, upon seeing it, immediately used
their movement techniques to hurry forward. They traversed a
kilometer with every single movement. This golden arrow of the Ji
clan was used as a summons, calling all of the men of the Ji clan in
the surrounding area who saw it to hurry forward to its location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yichuan saw
from far away that more than ten people were present, amongst them
the gray-robed Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow. The others belonged to
the Central Prefecture of the Ji clan; after all, this place was
closest to the Central Prefecture City, the City of Ten Thousand
Swords. These people turned to look and recognized this father-son
duo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, the two of
you, father and son, really are fast.” Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We hurried over from
the City of Ten Thousand Swords, but we just arrived. You two, father
and son, are located at the border regions of West Prefecture City,
but you arrived as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Xiantian experts
all said in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You came quite
quickly.” A laugh rang out. A ray of light descended at high speed,
then walked over. It was a middle-aged man dressed in beast furs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truekeep, you came
as well.” Ninefire smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw this
middle-aged figure come over. This man was named ‘Ji Truekeep’,
and he was the number one figure of the Ji clan of the Northern
Prefecture, on par with Ning’s father. For him to be able to hurry
over from North Prefecture City so quickly…it seemed that Ji
Truekeep should be a Zifu Disciple as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On the surface, my
Ji clan only has Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow, two Zifu Disciples.”
Ning said to himself. “However, a clan must have heirs and members
amongst the younger generation who have reached the Zifu Disciple
level. Now, it seems as though this Ji Truekeep truly is a Zifu
Disciple. My father, given the earlier movement abilities he
displayed, should also be a Zifu Disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Truekeep
glanced at each other, nodding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan spoke out,
“Patriarch, why have you summoned us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that you
have discovered as well,” Ninefire said solemnly, “That
underground, there is an elemental ore mine. A very rich vein of
elemental ore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” All of the
clansmen nodded, their eyes filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the rules of
the Grand Xia Dynasty, the land within ten thousand kilometers of a
commandery city belonged to the master of that commandery city! As
for any territories under dispute outside of that area, the ownership
of those regions depended on who had the strongest fist. This
elemental ore mine was extremely close to the City of Ten Thousand
Swords. According to the rules set by the Grand Xia Dynasty…without
question, it belonged to the Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not only is this
vein very rich, it is also very large.” Ninefire looked towards the
surrounding area. “We will now carry out a detailed analysis and
mapping of this elemental ore mine. I will fly towards the southeast.
Truekeep, you fly towards the north. Shadow, you fly towards the
southwest. As for everyone else, carefully investigate how deep this
mine is and the quality of the ore within it. No matter what the
results are, within four hours, we’ll regroup here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” All of them
assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, three rays of
light flew towards three different directions, while Ning, Yichuan,
and the others burrowed into the ground. Because there was no way to
use ground-tunneling arts through elemental ore, the only option they
had to was to slowly dig through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ning’s body became surrounded by the petals of his Waterflame
Lotus, which slowly swiveled about him, easily digging into the
ground below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This allowed Ning to
easily move deeper into the ground, step by step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he went
downwards, the earth and mud above him collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning just ignored
it, continuing to move downwards…and he soon ran into the surface
layer of the elemental ore mine. Large amounts of elemental ore were
connected to each other like ugly rocks. These were all low-quality
elemental stones, and just by looking at them, one wouldn’t be able
to see much of a difference between them and ordinary rocks. The only
difference was that they emanated quite a bit of an elemental aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
easily dug downwards, and Ning continued to move down at an
astonishing rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So deep.” Ning
could sense that he had already tunneled downwards for a hundred
kilometers, but he was still surrounded by a large amount of
elemental stones. “The hundred kilometers above me is filled with
elemental stones. How deep is this elemental ore mine? And the top of
the elemental ore mine was only a few dozen meters from the surface
of the ground. How is it that nobody has discovered this mine, in all
this time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
understand was that before Immortal Firedragon had set up a grand
formation, who could have possibly found it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.” He
finally encountered ordinary mud yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
kilometers deep.” Ning was stunned. “Ore mines are generally
spread out horizontally. If even the vertical depth is so great, how
wide must the mine be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Following this, Ning
immediately began moving upwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He finally emerged once
more, appearing on the surface of the ground. He quickly returned to
the gathering spot, where Ninefire, Granny Shadow, the old servant,
and Truekeep were already present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
looked towards Ning, his eyes lighting up. “You’ve already
completed your investigations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He glanced around. Traveling three hundred kilometers into
the ground was far more difficult than flying thousands of kilometers
in the air. Fortunately, he had been able to rely on his Waterflame
Lotus, which borrowed the elemental power of the world, to move so
easily. The others had to exhaust their ki in order to slowly dig.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How deep is it?”
Ninefire and the others all looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
kilometers.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Ninefire,
Granny Shadow, and Truekeep changed. They couldn’t be bothered to
feel amazed at how Ning had, in a single short hour, made a round
trip underground of more than three hundred kilometers. This was
because they were already beginning to grow panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This elemental ore
mine…” Ninefire said solemnly. “We’ve finished our
investigations as well. It has a circumference of at least four
thousand kilometers! If it has a depth of three hundred
kilometers…then this truly is an enormous large-scale elemental ore
mine. To our Ji clan, such an enormous elemental ore mine isn’t a
blessing; it is a calamity!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grand calamity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood. A stomach of a certain size could only hold a certain
amount of food; if you filled it with too much, you could die from
overstuffing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a rich vein,
and an enormous one.” Ninefire said solemnly. “Once we begin to
excavate it, the value of the ore within will definitely be countless
times greater than the total assets of the Ji clan. Tell me, how can
our Ji clan handle it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mine…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mine had been
formed after the peak Primal Daoist, ‘Daoist Firedragon’, had
paid an enormous price in order to set up a large formation to
collect elemental energy, so as to help himself break through. This
mine had been forming for one hundred years. If it was completely
mined out, the value of it would be comparable to half the assets of
an ordinary Primal Daoist. Because Daoist Firedragon had broken
through to the Earth Immortal level, his horizons had been expanded
and he no longer cared as much. In addition, mining the elemental ore
would simply be too difficult; even a Primal Daoist probably would be
too lazy to go through the mining. Only, the likes of Wanxiang Adepts
would go wild with excitement for something like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Granny Shadow immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not afraid of
others. I’m only afraid of Snowdragon Mountain!” Ninefire’s
face was filled with worry. “The Snowdragon Mountain of the Swallow
Mountain area is just a branch clan. Behind it…is the true
Snowdragon Mountain Sect! A major sect which has Primal Daoists
standing guard over it. And, based on my calculations and the passage
of time, the Zifu Disciples of the branch sect of Snowdragon Mountain
should have already arrived in the nearby area!”

Chapter 15 - Snowdragon Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything happened
just as Ji Ninefire predicted. A thousand kilometers away from them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a screen
hovering in mid-air, and atop that screen, there were four figures,
staring down below. Suddenly, a ray of light rose into the skies. It
was a large, armored, muscular man who was standing atop a
greatsword. This muscular man had a hint of a blue light glowing from
his skin, and standing there in midair atop that greatsword, he
looked like a Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow
disciples.” The muscular man had a look of delight on his face.
“I’ve finished my investigations. There is a large amount of
elemental ore underground, with high quality elemental stones within
the deposit. This is a very rich vein of elemental ore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” A long-haired
man who wore a black robe and had eight bloody trigrams in front and
behind him nodded, then laughed. “Junior apprentice-brother Ju San,
thank you for your hard work. Who would have expected that an
elemental ore mine such as this would have been hidden within the
territory of the Ji clan? Right. Junior apprentice-brother Ju San,
have you found any traces of mining?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black robed man
nodded in satisfaction. “The Ji clan has never sold elemental
stones to outsiders. It seems that prior to this, they hadn’t
discovered this vein either. My fellow disciples, I’d like to
trouble you to go in each direction and investigate carefully exactly
how large this vein is, while I will investigate how deep it is.
After finishing our investigations, we’ll gather here again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” Three men and women, including the
muscular man, acknowledged, then each flew away on their own
flying-type magic treasures, transforming into rays of light that
flew towards four different directions to investigate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black robed man
collected his flying screen while rushing towards the ground,
smashing through it and burrowing deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three men and one
woman who had left earlier had already returned, flying on their
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi still hasn’t finished exploring?” A
green-haired man said in surprise. “It seems this mine really is
quite deep.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on just what
we’ve learned, this elemental ore mine has to have a circumference
of four thousand kilometers.” A nearby woman whose hair was also
emanating a green light said solemnly. “If it’s deep as well…then
this mine is going to be an astonishing one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right after she
finished speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From below, a ray of
light surged towards the heavens, then came to a halt. It was their
black-robed elder apprentice-brother, Ziqi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” The three men and woman bowed
respectfully. Actually, all five of them were Zifu Disciples and of
the same generation. Logically speaking, there was no need for them
to act like this. But this Ziqi’s power was definitely far above
theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an elemental
ore mine. It is at least three hundred kilometers deep.” The
black-robed man sighed in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
kilometers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That deep?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of us have
found that this mine has a circumference of four thousand kilometers.
For it to also have such an astonishing depth…this elemental ore
mine is simply too…” The three men and one woman were all in a
state of shock. Some mines were fairly shallow, and it made sense for
a mine of a circumference of thousands of kilometers to just a few
kilometers deep. But this one was three hundred kilometers deep!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
shouted, “This elemental ore mine belongs to Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, it belongs to
our Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve rendered a
major merit. The main sect will definitely reward us heavily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our chance has
come!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them were
all incomparably excited. They were easily able to tell the general
size and scale of this elemental ore mine and knew the value of it.
The value was inconceivably high! Most likely, even those Primal
Daoists that stood at the very pinnacle of power in Snowdragon
Mountain would care deeply about this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” The green-haired woman frowned. “This
place is very close to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. According to
the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, this place should be considered as
belonging to the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is the
Ji clan?” Ziqi snorted coldly. “Dare they intervene in Snowdragon
Mountain’s mine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby green-haired
man nodded. “No need to worry about the Ji clan. Snowdragon
Mountain is definitely taking over this elemental ore mine! But no
matter what, we can’t be too incautious. According to the laws of
the Grand Xia Dynasty, this place is the territory of the City of Ten
Thousand Swords, which means this mine belongs to the Ji clan. Our
Snowdragon Mountain cannot openly violate the laws of the Grand Xia
Dynasty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Dong Ziqi
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if they had to
skirt the laws, they definitely couldn’t openly challenge the Grand
Xia Dynasty! Even the Marquis Palace of Stillwater Commandery, which
was almost as ancient as the Grand Xia Dynasty itself, wouldn’t
dare to challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, I’m
only afraid of one thing.” The green-haired man frowned. “If the
Ji clan were to send someone to ally with the army of the Grand Xia
Dynasty and sign a contract giving this site up to the Grand Xia
Dynasty…! If they were to directly sign over this mine to the Grand
Xia Dynasty, then there would be nothing that we can do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-brother
Hefang speaks reason.” A cold-faced, gray-robed man nodded. “We
have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do have to be
careful.” The muscular man said frantically, “The Ji clan
definitely will realize that they aren’t strong enough to hold this
mine. If they give up the mine to the Grand Xia Dynasty, then the Ji
clan will at least gain thirty percent of it! This would also result
in them having the Grand Xia Dynasty supporting them. We wouldn’t
be able to do anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sign an agreement?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi’s eyes were
dark and gloomy. “It’s not that easy to do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four looked
towards Dong Ziqi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The garrison of the
Grand Xia Dynasty in the Swallow Mountain region are in Swallow
Mountain City.” Dong Ziqi said. “The general of that garrison is
a good friend of mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi, as soon as the Ji clan makes a report and
offers to transfer the mine…a mere general wouldn’t dare to
suppress the news. If he forcibly suppresses the report of something
as major as this, and is later discovered to have done so, then the
general will definitely have his soul shattered and dispersed in
punishment.” The green-haired man said, concerned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi said, “I know
that. He won’t dare to forcibly suppress the news, but at least
he’ll be able to delay it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The other
four looked at Ziqi as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know.”
Dong Ziqi said. “The first part to signing an agreement of
relinquishing a mine is the report to the higher ups! Afterwards, the
higher ups will immediately send people to investigate the Ji clan’s
territory. Only after they have verified that there is indeed such a
mine within the Ji clan’s territory will they sign the contract.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was indeed the
case.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the report was
made, someone would immediately be sent over. The efficiency would be
very high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as the
report is made, we won’t be able to act as we please.” Ziqi said,
“What we can do is to have the garrison general at Swallow Mountain
City delay as much as he can…and in addition, it will take time for
the person sent by the Grand Xia Dynasty to make his way over. This
will be enough time for us to seize the City of Ten Thousand Swords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize the City of
Ten Thousand Swords?” The other four nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as we take
over the City of Ten Thousand Swords and acquire the official writ,
then we will be the masters of the City of Ten Thousand Swords. In
accordance with the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the mine will
belong to us. Even if the Grand Xia Dynasty sends someone
over…because the official writ has a new owner, there will be no
way for the Ji clan to sign a contract.” Ziqi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. We’ll take
over the official writ!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the official
writ is in our hands, we will be the masters of the mine.” Cold
light flashed in each of their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi said in a low
voice, “If the Ji clan dares to resist, then annihilate them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
four nodded, not worried about the Ji clan at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi, before this, when we were investigating the
size of the mine, we discovered that the Ji clan’s forces were
within a thousand kilometers.” The green-haired woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ziqi
said as he let out a cold snort. “Let’s go visit the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
in the air above the elemental ore mine, quite a few Zifu Disciples
were conducting investigations, including the Ironwood clan, the
Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult…they were all
local forces of Swallow Mountain. Only the forces of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, stationed in Swallow Mountain City, were not present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a rich vein.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such an elemental
ore mine…just looking at it is frightening.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The desolate mountain
forests. The Ji clan’s forces were gathered there, deciding what to
do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a gloomy
voice rang out. This voice caused the faces of quite a few clansmen
of the Ji clan to change. Ning’s soul, being so powerful, wasn’t
impacted much. He raised his head to look. He saw that high above
them in mid-air, an enormous screen was descending towards them at
high speed. Standing atop the screen were five men and women, all of
them with extraordinary auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of the group
was emanating a deathly cold aura. He was dressed in black, and the
front and back of his robe were covered with eight bloody trigrams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Ziqi!”
Ninefire’s face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked carefully
at the five on the screen, paying special attention to their leader,
Dong Ziqi. “He is Dong Ziqi, of the Swallow Mountain branch of
Snowdragon Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi’s fame was
widespread, and he was quietly acknowledged to be the number one
expert of the six hegemons of the Swallow Mountain region!

Chapter 16 - Crossing Swords
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and the others had long ago come to view Ji Ning as the
future pillar of the Ji clan! They naturally had long ago allowed
Ning to view the intelligence reports the clan had regarding the
various ancient monsters and Zifu Disciples of the various forces
spread throughout Swallow Mountain. Ning knew very well…that this
Dong Ziqi was a peak Zifu Disciple, one who had come from the main
sect, whose abilities were far more powerful than those available to
the local tribes of the Swallow Mountain Region. Dong Ziqi’s most
powerful ability was the ‘Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was different from
other great formations, which generally needed to be set up in
advance. This ‘Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation’ was rather
similar to the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]; one could activate
it with a thought. Perhaps it wasn’t as high level and as
formidable as the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], but this was a
peak Zifu Disciple. When such a man used this formation, he probably
would be able to fight a new Wanxiang Adept to a standstill. This
wasn’t something which could be compared the likes of Bei Zishan,
who had to rely on the Myriad Wraiths Banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare
for us to be able to see you, fellow Daoist Dong.” Ninefire’s
attitude was very humble. “Fellow Daoist Dong, might I ask why you
have come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Zifu Disciples
atop the banner landed on the ground. They swept the Ji clansmen with
their gaze. Their eyes were filled with lofty arrogance; clearly,
they held the Ji clan in no regard. This caused Ning and the others
to feel a hint of rage in their hearts, but they understood…they
had to suppress it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The land which your
Ji clan controls really is a blessed area. It actually has an
elemental ore mine.” Ziqi’s cold, sinister eyes stared at
Ninefire. “If it wasn’t for the elemental energy vibrations which
emanated from here two days ago, we wouldn’t have had any idea.
Hmph. I imagine that your Ji clan has secretly mined out quite a few
elemental stones. You really are quite bold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looks of anger couldn’t
help but appear in the eyes of the Ji clansmen, but Ninefire used his
ki to bark at them mentally, “All of you, endure it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Ji clan just
discovered it as well.” Ninefire maintained a smiling face towards
Ziqi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just discovered it?”
Ziqi swept the Ji clansmen with his gaze. “Have you investigated
the size and scale of this elemental mine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet.” Ninefire
shook his head. “All we know is that this is a rich vein of
elemental ore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi said in a cold
voice, “Since you don’t know, then I’ll tell you. Not only is
this a rich vein, it stretches to a circumference of four thousand
kilometers, and is three hundred kilometers deep as well! Your tiny
little Ji clan is completely unable to try and swallow such an
enormous elemental ore mine; if you tried, it would choke you to
death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s fine.”
Ninefire laughed. “In the end, my Ji clan can just offer this
elemental ore mine to the Grand Xia Dynasty. By then, our Ji clan
will obtain 30% of it, while the Grand Xia Dynasty will obtain 70%.
In addition, our Ji clan will also receive the protection of the
Grand Xia Dynasty, at which point we won’t fear anyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi’s pupils
contracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These locals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they didn’t
come from any sects, and thus remained Zifu Disciples despite having
trained for nearly four centuries, after having lived so long, these
people had become incomparably crafty. Just now, he had been so
arrogant, but Ninefire had remained all smiles. However, at the
critical point in their negotiations, Ninefire had directly given
voice to what Snowdragon Mountain feared the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up!” Dong
Ziqi’s voice was incomparably cold. “This elemental ore mine is
being taken over by Snowdragon Mountain! Don’t threaten me. If you
threaten me…the only result will be the destruction of the Ji
clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire’s face
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others, such as
Granny Shadow, were all both angry and agitated when they heard this.
Ning felt a smoldering rage burn in his heart as well. Clearly,
according to the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, this elemental ore
mine belonged to the Ji clan! But Snowdragon Mountain’s people
wanted to just take it from them, and in such a domineering manner?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Dong.”
Ninefire suppressed his rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had just
decided to bring out the strongest ‘threat’ he could must…so as
to cause the opponents to feel nervous, and then engage in
negotiations. He didn’t expect that these people didn’t want to
negotiate at all; they acted with completely tyranny, wanting to take
advantage of the Ji clan in their weakness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Swallow
Mountain.” Ninefire said solemnly. “The main Snowdragon Mountain
Sect is millions of kilometers away, but once my Ji clan makes the
report, in just a few days, the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia
Dynasty will arrive. By then, we will just directly sign a transfer
agreement. Actually, our Ji clan doesn’t have that much ambition;
the only thing we desire is to survive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survive?” Ziqi
laughed coldly. “At least you know your own limits!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said,
“Snowdragon Mountain can arrange for people to mine this quarry.
Our Ji clan definitely will not disturb you during the mining
process. After you have completed your mining…all we ask is that
you remove all of your forces from the Ji clan’s territory. As for
the ore in this elemental ore mine, my Ji clan will not ask for a
single stone of it! My Ji clan is willing to set up an Oath of
Heavenly Law with your Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oath of Heavenly Law…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was useless for
ordinary mortals, but no one who had stepped onto the path of
Immortal cultivation would dare to violate an Oath of Heavenly Law.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ziqi
hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” The nearby muscular man sent mentally
through his Ki. “These conditions aren’t bad. We don’t care
about the territory the Ji clan controls anyhow. What really matters
is that elemental ore mine. Since the Ji clan is willing to allow us
to harvest all of the ore within the elemental ore mine…if they are
willing to set up an Oath of Heavenly Law, then they won’t dare
violate it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Idiot.” The
green-haired woman to the side sent mentally as well. “This is just
a delaying tactic of the Ji clan! The Ji clan is going to set up an
Oath of Heavenly Law with ‘us’, but not with those of us here.
Even if we fellow disciples swear to an Oath of Heavenly Law, the
high level members of the main sect can still decide to just cast us
aside and exterminate the Ji clan. They definitely want us to have a
high-level member of the main sect to come here and swear the oath.
But we would first need to send work back, and by the time the
high-level member of the main sect comes…more than enough time will
have passed for the Ji clan and the Grand Xia Dynasty to have signed
an agreement.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Younger
apprentice-sister, your words have merit.” The gray-robed man sent
mentally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi nodded
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clansmen were
still awaiting their response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Ji clan wishes
to swear an Oath of Heavenly Law with Snowdragon Mountain…might I
ask, which member of Snowdragon Mountain do you wish to come swear
the oath with you?” Ziqi looked at Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire laughed. “Any
Wanxiang Adept is acceptable. The fate of our Ji clan rests on this
agreement; naturally, we must be cautious. The weight of an oath of a
Zifu Disciple of Snowdragon Mountain isn’t quite enough…and we
don’t dare trust fully in it either. I imagine that you, fellow
Daoist Dong, also understand that the oath of a Zifu Disciple doesn’t
have much binding power over the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi narrowed his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single Zifu Disciple?
The main sect could sacrifice one with but a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a Wanxiang Adept
was different. The main sect only had a limited number of them, and
when they swore an oath, it represented the main sect swearing an
oath! If the main sect dared to sacrifice even a Wanxiang Adept,
wouldn’t it cause the other Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples to
have an icy feeling in their hearts? To cause the Wanxiang Adepts of
the clan to all have lessened loyalty, for the sake of an elemental
ore mine, wasn’t worth it. Thus, it was most appropriate for a
Wanxiang Adept to come and swear the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire!” Ziqi
said in a freezing voice. “You want a Wanxiang Adept to come and
swear an Oath of Heavenly Law with you? They are high level members
of my main sect, which is over a million kilometers away! After we
send the message, it will take at least ten days or half a month for
a Wanxiang Adept to come! Within ten day’s time, your Ji clan would
most likely have secretly signed an agreement with the Grand Xia
Dynasty long ago!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…” Ninefire
hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, you had
best hand over the official writ!” Ziqi shouted. “Hand over the
official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords to us! Snowdragon
Mountain will continue to permit you to live within the City of Ten
Thousand Swords, and everything will remain unchanged for the Ji
clan…after we have completely excavated the elemental ore mine, we
will return the official writ to you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was frantic.
“How can that be acceptable?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way.” Granny
Shadow said angrily as well. “The official writ is the very
foundation of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These people of
Snowdragon Mountain…you gave them an inch, and they attempted to
take a mile! They made it sound so nice and simple; they would return
the official writ after finishing the excavation? What if they
didn’t? In addition, the Ji clan had already made a huge concession
in being willing to offer the entire mine to Snowdragon Mountain. How
could it be that Snowdragon Mountain now desired to take away the
official writ as well, and ‘give it back’ in the future?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
face was ugly to behold, and the same was true for the other members
of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think that
our Snowdragon Mountain clan will lie to a petty little clan like the
Ji clan?” Ziqi shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
Snowdragon Mountain has taken advantage of quite a few clans.”
Ninefire was enraged as well. “Otherwise, why would a branch of
Snowdragon Mountain have come to Swallow Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outrageous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire actually had
become harder and more forceful! Zifi swept the Ji clansmen with his
gaze, noticing that youngest, solitary figure, the fur-clad youth. He
immediately sent through his Ki, “Junior apprentice-brother Muse,
the Ji clan only has a few Zifu Disciples. The one with the most
potential is this Ji Ning; he is the one who, according to the
stories, killed Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
gray-robed man noticed the fur-clad youth in front of them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That battle he had with
Bei Zishan that year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s reputation had
been spread throughout the various forces of Swallow Mountain long
ago. After all, at that time, quite a few Xiantian lifeforms of the
various clans had all been sent back to their own clans, causing them
to become aware of how terrifying Ji Ning was, and that Ji Ning
should be a Zifu Disciple! A Zifu Disciple at age eleven or
twelve…how terrifying would he be in the future? The various powers
had taken notice of Ning long ago, and the intelligence reports
regarding Ning were thus incomparably detailed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything which had
happened to him since he was young, as well as his appearance and his
habits…they had all been collected and compiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi didn’t care
about anyone else in the entire Ji clan; the only one he cared about
was this Ji Ning! He didn’t fear the current Ji Ning; what he
feared was the future Ji Ning! Given Ji Ning’s talent…in the
future, it probably wouldn’t be too hard for him to become a
Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Muse, the member of the Ji clan with the most
potential and who poses the greatest threat is this Ji Ning. The
entire Ji clan treats him as their treasure.” Ziqi sent mentally.
“He is still fairly young, however, and at present, he shouldn’t
be too powerful. Zishan, that fool…aside from being able to forge
that Myriad Wraiths Banner, which was fairly powerful, his own level
of ability wasn’t that great. In addition, the results of that
battle probably had something to do with that Wanxiang Adept. Ji
Ning’s own level of power is most likely not that great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, make a sudden attack and capture Ji Ning! By
then, with Ji Ning in our hands, do you think the Ji clan will dare
to disobey the orders of our Snowdragon Mountain?” Ziqi sent
mentally. “Even in the extremely unlikely circumstance that they
don’t care about Ji Ning’s life, we will then simply kill Ji
Ning. Without him, the Ji clan won’t pose a threat to us at all in
the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
gray-robed man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was indeed a
threat to them. Nobody feared Ning right now, but they feared the
future Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, if you suddenly use your magic technique to
attack, even I will have some trouble fending it off. You shouldn’t
have any problems in subduing Ji Ning.” Ziqi sent mentally.
Although his power was greater than that of Muse’s, he had to first
activate his Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. By the time he
did so, the Ji clan would probably be at maximum vigilance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, they had to make
a sudden attack, and succeed in an instant! For this, Muse was the
best choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me. I
made a breakthrough in this technique of mine not long ago.” Muse
sent back mentally with great confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll just
wait for you. Once you take down Ji Ning…we will have the upper
hand.” Ziqi said.

Chapter 17 - Longing! Rain Line!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a single glance,
Dong Ziqi saw clearly the Ji clan’s weakness. His thoughts were
completely correct; Ji Ning was indeed the future pillar of the Ji
clan! In this group of Ji clan experts…even if Ji Ninefire and
Granny Shadow had to die, they wouldn’t let Ning die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefire, I urge you
to obediently hand over the official writ.” Ziqi frowned as he
shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Ji clan is indeed
weak and small, which is why we are willing to offer this elemental
ore mine to you without requesting any part of it. But for you to try
and forcibly take over our official writ…you are perhaps going too
far! The official writ is the foundation of the Ji clan. How can my
Ji clan…” Ninefire’s face changed halfway through his words,
and he couldn’t help but lower his head to look at the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground was
trembling slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi’s group of
five stood in the distance, and in their midst, the gray-robed man’s
eyes flashed. The ki in his body had long ago entered the ground. By
the time the Ji clan’s Zifu Disciples sensed it, the technique had
already been executed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BOOM!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strands of green,
wooden vines emerged suddenly from the ground, all of them flailing
about wildly, covered with a layer of deep green light. The thin,
slender strands of vines twined about each other like a tough cord
rope. They suddenly emerged from the ground beneath Ning’s feet,
instantly wrapping themselves around Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Completely caught
off-guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” The faces
of Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others changed. In the blink of
an eye, Ji Ning, who had been standing next to them just moments ago,
had been wildly entangled by those countless rattan vines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, save Ji
Ning!” Granny Shadow shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late!” Dong
Ziqi, standing in the distance, just laughed loudly as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless vines
wrapped around Ning whipped out violently, throwing him towards the
ground. With a rumble, an enormous crevice appeared within the
ground, with Ning and those vines already burrowed deep within the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain,
you actually…” Ninefire’s face was savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release my son.”
Ji Yichuan was frantic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every member of the Ji
clan wanted to save Ning, but the sudden emergence of those vines,
which had wrapped around Ning and then thrown him underground, caused
them to not know what they should do to save him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Dong
Ziqi just laughed wildly as he turned to look at the gray-robed man.
“Junior apprentice-brother Muse, bring Ji Ning over here…” Dong
Ziqi’s face suddenly changed, because he saw that his fellow
disciple’s forehead was matted with sweat. Clearly, he was already
going all out in this struggle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ji Ning is
currently breaking through my technique…” The gray-robed man’s
eyes had turned red, and he was pouring all of his ki into the
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A seed had grown into
thousands of wooden green tendrils, which were now heavily entangling
themselves around Ning. Within the entangling clutches of the vines,
a Waterflame Lotus was surrounding Ning, constantly swiveling around
him and frantically resisting these tendrils, unceasingly killing
them one by one while the dead vines were unceasingly being reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal
practitioners truly have many techniques at their disposal. This
technique wasn’t included in our intelligence reports. I wonder
which branch member of Snowdragon Mountain used it.” Ning had
suddenly suffered an attack, and this attack was too fast, giving him
no time to break through before he had been thrown underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the constriction
of the tendrils, the amount of space Ning had to move in was too
limited, giving him no chance to use the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the first thing
Ning had done was to execute the Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swivel, swivel…”
The Waterflame Lotus slowly swiveled, grinding those thin vines that
wanted to entangle Ning into dust. Nearly five years had passed since
that battle with Bei Zishan, and during these five years, Ning’s
improvements with regards to his understanding of the Dao had only
grown greater and greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If early on, the
insight he had gained with regards to the Dao was just a thread, over
the course of time, he had gained more threads of the True Meaning of
the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These many thin
threads…had drawn close to each other, naturally resulting in a
thicker thread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s time spent at
Serpentwing Lake in particular, where he was virtually always in tune
with the world…had resulted in him reaching a very high level of
understanding. Actually, this was something which could only be
accomplished by an Immortal practitioner who had reached a very high
level of understanding. When one could always be in tune with nature
and always be able to go attune with the Dao, it was only natural
that one would gain many insights into the True Meaning of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His level of
understanding had risen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the power his
Waterflame Lotus now had was naturally much greater than before. That
murderous grinding power alone would most likely instantly grind even
peak Xiantian experts into tiny pieces in but an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth sword.”
Within the Waterflame Lotus, Ning drew forth a Darknorth sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Longing! Rain Line!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured softly to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time he used this
technique, he couldn’t help but think of his mother. This technique
was one which he had developed thanks to the boundless longing he
felt for his mother! It was the longing each drop of rain held for
each other drop which allowed them to form a line of rain…the
insights Ning had gained over the past five years into the Dao had
resulted in him developing many techniques, but this was the most
powerful of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique
contained within it a boundless, powerful longing. It was born from
the [Raindrop Sutra], but it had left the Raindrop Sutra far behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simultaneously
struck out with two Darknorth swords at the same time, piercing past
the Waterflame Lotus, which seemed to be like a shadow, not
obstructing Ning’s swords in the slightest. Ning’s swords seemed
to be like the caress of a mother, carrying boundless longing within
them…as they summoned a large amount of natural power which
directly coalesced atop the two swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone seeing this
technique would unconsciously feel a sour feeling in their hearts,
sense a powerful, endless yearning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…” Many
vines were instantly shattered. Although they were very tough, they
were still chopped apart. In the face of Ning’s most powerful
close-combat sword technique, the technique of Zifu Disciple Muse was
unable to contain Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the first
reason for this was that Ning’s swordplay had already far
outstripped that of most Zifu Disciples. Most likely, even many
Wanxiang Adepts wouldn’t be on par with him in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second reason was
that Ning’s Fiendgod body was simply too powerful, comparable to an
early-stage Fiendgod Zifu Disciple. His strength was so mighty, and
his swordplay was so formidable; how hard must it be for a technique
to contain him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword light flashed and
danced, shattering a large number of frantically twisting vines. Ning
followed his sword light and rose into the sky, breaking through the
earth and arriving on the surface of the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the Ji clansmen
were worriedly looking at the ground, into the hole from whence the
rattan vines had disappeared, suddenly, hundreds of meters away, the
ground suddenly exploded as a ray of sword light soared into the sky.
A fur-clad youth, wielding a pair of swords, his body surrounded by a
Fire-water Lotus, suddenly drifted up, then landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible!” Dong Ziqi’s face changed dramatically. Others might
not understand this technique of his junior apprentice-brother’s,
but he understood it very well. A sudden attack from this
technique…it would be very difficult for someone to break through
it. Even if one succeeded, it would only come at great effort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ji Ning broke
through?” The muscular man behind Ziqi stared as he growled, “How
is that possible. I’m a Fiendgod practitioner, but even I wouldn’t
be able to break through if senior apprentice-brother Muse captured
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Junior apprentice Ju
San was the newest Zifu Disciple of the five, who had only recently
established his Violet Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was just an early
Zifu Disciple, but he was a Fiendgod practitioner! As an early
Fiendgod practitioner…his battle strength was also amazing. It
didn’t matter if others injured him, but if he landed a hit on
someone else, that person would die! This was the advantage which
Fiendgod practitioners had; if he trained to become a late stage
Fiendgod Zifu Disciple, even Dong Ziqi would address him as ‘senior
apprentice-brother’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He broke through?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How old is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Muse’s ‘Myriad Ancient Green Vines’
technique…was broken, just like that?” That green-haired
male-female pair stared as well, their faces filled with disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their group, Muse’s
status was second only to Ziqi, precisely because of how powerful he
was! In particular, his ambushing abilities with the ‘Myriad
Ancient Green Vines’ had caused the other fellow disciples to feel
endless admiration for him. The restricting power of those green
vines was indeed tremendous. How physically strong was a Fiendgod
Zifu Disciple? And yet, even such a person was unable to break
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the person who had
broken through it…was only sixteen years old! No matter how
monstrous of a genius he was, it was too…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could they know
that Ning’s physical strength was comparable to their junior
apprentice-brother Ju San to begin with. In terms of his level of
attainment in the sword, he vastly outstripped Ju San by many levels!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ji
Ninefire, Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the other members of the Ji
clan all stared at Ning with surprise and delight. At the same time,
they felt unbearably pleased at the looks of shock and amazement on
the faces of the five Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain!
Simultaneously, the Ji clansmen couldn’t help but feel stunned at
Ning’s power. Ninefire’s eyes actually narrowed as he sighed in
his heart that he felt he was growing more and more mystified by this
kid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
surrounding Ning vanished, and he walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A hoarse
voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, there was a
gray-robed man with an ashen, pallid face who stood by Dong Ziqi’s
side. The man was staring fixedly at Ning. “You…what’s the name
of that sword technique of yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Longing.” Ning
said softly. “Rain Line!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rain Line?” The
gray-robed man stared wide-eyed in disbelief. “The power of the
Rain Line technique of your Ji clan’s [Raindrop Sutra] is this
great?” He was quite familiar with the nine sword stances of the
[Raindrop Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are quite a
few things that you don’t know.” Ning snorted coldly, no longer
explaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword technique
was birthed from the Raindrop Sutra, but it was no longer the same as
the Rain Line technique of the past.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rain Line?” Dong
Ziqi murmured softly as well. The four Zifu Disciples behind him were
still in a state of shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning is even
more powerful than anticipated.” Ziqi pondered. “He’s only
sixteen years old, but even junior apprentice-brother Muse is unable
to take him down! Most likely, only I will be capable of killing
him.” If he were to personally attack, he would have to use his
Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Once the formation appeared,
then the two sides would fight to the death, and there would be no
chance to salvage the situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi was very
self-confident, but he also understood that the Ji clan’s power
wasn’t weak either. If they were really to fight against each
other, his side would lose one or two of their five Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could let the
other side retreat in the face of encroaching difficulties, that
would be for the best.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clansmen all
looked towards Ning. “Are you alright?” Ji Yichuan looked at his
son. Seeing that his son was unwounded, he relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Ziqi!” Granny
Shadow said in a fierce voice. “What was the meaning of this? You
suddenly attacked a member of our Ji clan! All of us are present, and
yet you still dare to behave so rashly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Snowdragon
Mountain clansmen are too wild and unbridled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clansmen were
all very angry, but they still forced themselves not to attack. The
opponents, after all, belonged to Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Dong
Ziqi just laughed. “Sudden attack? That’s a nasty way to put it.
My junior apprentice-brother simply heard long ago that your Ji clan
produced a genius with exceptional talents, and that even junior
apprentice-brother Bei Zishan of our Snowdragon Mountain died in his
hands. Today, when we saw this genius, he couldn’t help but feel
his hands itch and want to have a little spar. What, can it be that a
Zifu Disciple of our Snowdragon Mountain is forbidden from sparring
with a member of your Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You call that a
spar?” Granny Shadow said in a fierce, hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally.” Ziqi
said. “And now, it seems that this genius of your Ji clan is indeed
formidable. He was able to break through the technique of my junior
apprentice-brother. Admirable, admirable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Granny
Shadow felt a fiery rage build in her belly. She had lived for nearly
four centuries, but had never been angered like this before. If she
didn’t have other things holding her back, she would’ve attacked
long ago, but for the sake of the rest of the Ji clan, she had to
endure it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A savage look flashed
past Ziqi’s eyes, and he snorted coldly. “Forget about sparring;
even if we really killed that Ji Ning, what would your Ji clan do
about it?” Dong Ziqi’s cold, sinister eyes swept past this group
of Ji clansmen, and a disdainful smile was playing at the corner of
his lips, causing the Ji clansmen to feel all the more enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swollen with arrogance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ziqi was doing was
being swollen with arrogance, with the intention of completely
suppressing the Ji clansmen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
Truekeep was truly enraged now, and he shouted, “Our Ji clan cannot
let ourselves be so easily abused as this. I’d rather live and
stand fighting rather than die kneeling. Our Ji clan has made one
concession after another, but Snowdragon Mountain just continues to
advance and pressure us further. Do they really take our Ji clan to
be made out of mud, for them to mold as they please? Let’s go all
out against them! Five of them came today. We are definitely going to
make sure at least half of them die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, let’s
go all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They refuse to give
our Ji clan a way out. We won’t let them live either.”
Immediately, quite a few Ji clansmen egan to bellow with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Dong Ziqi
and his group of five to be slightly startled. Snowdragon Mountain
was indeed mighty, but that was thanks to the main sect! The Swallow
Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain, by itself, was more powerful
than the Ji clan, true, but only to a certain point…after all,
everyone only had access to Zifu Disciple level fighters at most. If
they really went all out, even if Snowdragon Mountain eradicated the
Ji clan, the losses to the Swallow Mountain branch would still be
heavy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouths.”
Ninefire turned and shouted mentally through his Ki, his voice
reverberating within the ears of each member of the clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clansmen all looked
towards Ji Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are they
discussing?” That muscular young man, Ju San, asked the other
members of Snowdragon Mountain mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These local
bumpkins.” The gray-robed Muse sent back. “They are used to life
in the tribes, where they would rather break than bend. If you force
them too far, they’ll go all out…we gave them a bit too much
pressure, and so they are beginning to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi sent back
confidently, “No need to worry. Ninefire is an old fellow who has
lived for nearly four centuries. He is quite sly. He will remonstrate
with and hold back those other clansmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clansmen were
secretly speaking mentally to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
has gone too far, true.” Ninefire sent mentally. “But no matter
how arrogant they behave, we have to endure it. Or are we really
going to fight against them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Patriarch, we
can sign a transfer agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty. By then, we
would have the protection of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and we would even
receive thirty percent of this elemental ore mine.” A muscular
member of the Ji clan sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fool!” Ninefire
sent back. “To sign a transfer agreement with the Grand Xia
Dynasty, we must first make a report, at which point an Celestial
Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty would come to inspect this elemental
ore mine. Only at the very end would a transfer agreement be signed!
This process takes time. During the course of such a long period of
time, our Ji clan would most likely suffer the risk of annihilation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of
thirty percent of an elemental ore mine, cause the entire clan to
fall into the risk of annihilation?” Ninefire shouted.
“Foolishness, utter foolishness! And even if we truly do succeed in
signing a transfer agreement, resulting in the Grand Xia Dynasty
protecting our Ji clan for a thousand years…what about after that
thousand years? By then, Snowdragon Mountain would come to take
revenge on our Ji clan, and our clan would still end up doomed.
That’s why I would rather give this entire elemental ore mine to
Snowdragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is too
infuriating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hearts of every Ji
clansman burned with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how angry
and unwilling to accept it we might feel, for the sake of the Ji
clan, we have to endure it all.” Ninefire sighed mentally to them.
“As long as the Ji clan can continue to exist and prosper, so what
if we have to suffer some mistreatment?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you have to blame
someone, then blame us for not being strong enough. This clearly is a
stroke of luck bestowed upon us by the heavens, but we are unable to
accept and make use of this elemental ore mine.” Ninefire looked
towards Ning. “Ji Ning, you are the most incredible talent which
our Ji clan has ever produced, since the founding of the clan. If you
continue developing, even becoming a Wanxiang Adept is virtually
guaranteed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the clansmen
looked towards Ning, their eyes filled with hope and longing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hopes of the Ji
clan’s future rise to prominence rested on him! These Xiantian
lifeforms of the Central Prefecture previously had held some doubts
regarding Ning’s power, as prior to this, they had only heard
rumors about him…but now, they had personally witnessed Ning reveal
some of his power. He had even broken through the technique of a
powerful Zifu Disciple expert of Snowdragon Mountain. Ning was only
sixteen years old! When they thought of Ning’s potential, all of
them were excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, no matter
how great a genius someone is, once he’s dead, he’s no longer a
genius.” Ninefire looked at Ning. “For the sake of our Ji clan,
you must survive and live a long life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He thought of a
person…the fourth master of the Aquatic Manor. Rampart. The man
who, despite the presence of so many competitors, had successfully
become the personal disciple of Immortal Juhua. There was no need to
say anything about his talent…but he had died as a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We members of the Ji
clan will firmly remember the insults we have borne today.”
Ninefire looked at every member of the clan. “We have to grow
strong. After we grow strong, others will not dare to insult us, look
down on us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
clansmen all nodded, and Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and his group
of five Zifu Disciples just watched to the side. Watched as the group
of Ji clansmen all forcibly restrained and swallowed the anger.
Seeing the looks on their faces, they couldn’t help but snicker.
This was something they had seen too many times. In the past, when
they had acted on orders from the main sect, those minor tribes and
clans had all been forced to bend their waists and lower their heads
in the face of Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Ziqi.”
Ninefire turned his head to look towards Ziqi and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finished chatting?”
Ziqi looked at Ninefire. “But Ninefire, let me tell you clearly
that no matter what, you must hand over the official writ for the
City of Ten Thousand Swords! If you don’t hand it over, then the
destruction of your Ji clan will be impending!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the Ji
clan were barely able to restrain their rage, which was now painted
upon their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They ‘had’ to hand
over the official writ?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wasn’t this the same
as forcing their Ji clan to give up their territory?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire clenched his
teeth, his face ugly to behold. One word at a time, he ground out,
“My Ji clan can give up the official writ and leave this land! This
land will all belong to Snowdragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was stunned.
Ning stared at the Patriarch in shock as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire continued to
speak, grinding each word out. “But your Snowdragon Mountain must
give our Ji clan an official writ as well, to give our Ji clan a
place to resist! We’ll use the official writ for our City of Ten
Thousand Swords in exchange for another official writ of a large
commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Our Ji clan is willing to
leave our homeland and depart.”

Chapter 19 - Separation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Turn their backs on
their homeland and leave?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning forcibly
suppressed the unwillingness in his heart. He wasn’t willing. He
truly wasn’t willing. But he saw that all the members of the clan
around him, including his father, Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the
others were all silent. As long as the Ji clan could continue to
survive and prosper, then they would be willing to endure even
departing from their homeland!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as
Snowdragon Mountain will hand over an official writ.” Ninefire said
in a low voice. “Then our Ji clan will immediately hand over the
official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Official writ?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distance, Dong
Ziqi and the other five looked at each other, quietly discussing this
amongst each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ziqi, what should we do?” The green-haired woman
sent mentally. “Hand over an official writ?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over?” Ziqi
looked at the green-haired woman. “Junior apprentice-sister He
Xing, will you hand over one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired woman
immediately shut her mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Zifu Disciples
who had left the main sect and independently set up branches were all
those who didn’t have much potential, and could be considered outer
members of the sect. The commandery cities of the Grand Xia Dynasty
they had taken over in the Swallow Mountain region was their
foundation as well! It was also the foundation of many of their
tribes, and their forces had coalesced there long ago. How could they
give them up?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hand over an official
writ?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would hand it over?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elemental ore mine
would be given to the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect. Why should we
sacrifice? Why should our tribes sacrifice? Every single commandery
city had three Zifu Disciples. They had to all agree before the
official writ would be relinquished! But who would be willing to
relinquish a base they had built up over so many years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We aren’t willing
to give ours up, but can it be that our fellow disciples in other
areas would be willing to hand over a commandery city of theirs?”
Ziqi shook his head. “Our Snowdragon Mountain has many branches,
and those fellow disciples of those branches won’t care about us at
all. How could they be so kind-hearted as to relinquish a commandery
city for us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least, it’s
impossible for our Ju clan. I don’t agree, and my uncle in the clan
won’t agree either.” The muscular man said hurriedly. “Forget
it. I refuse to believe the Ji clan will really dare to resist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
nodded. “Force the Ji clan! If they resist, we will exterminate
their clan! If they obey us, they will still be able to stay alive! I
trust the Ji clan knows what they should do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This isn’t
the first time we’ve done this.” The muscular man, Ju San, nodded
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then that’s what
we’ll do.” The gray-robed Muse nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi looked at his
four fellow disciples. Although not every member of the Swallow
Mountain branch had come, since after all they couldn’t possibly
summon everyone just for the sake of an elemental ore mine, these
five represented all of the various internal factions of the Swallow
Mountain branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ziqi
nodded. “Then that’s what we will do. Just as junior
apprentice-brother Ju San said, this isn’t the first time we’ve
done this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain had
many branches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With so many branches,
how could they take over enough commandery cities? Fighting for each
one?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was lunacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could simply use
the butcher’s blade and their fame to frighten others
simultaneously. In truth, the vast majority of tribes would, in the
end, grit their teeth and swallow their rage, voluntarily
relinquishing their official writs and obediently leaving. But of
course, some battles would occasionally occur, as there were no
absolutes. Dong Ziqi, however, was confident that his side’s power
was definitely superior to that of the Ji clan’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan was
waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they felt
heartache and unwillingness, Ning and everyone else had begun to
mentally prepare for leaving their homeland. As long as the Ji clan
was able to continue to survive, it would all be worth it. The Ji
clan was waiting for Snowdragon mountain’s response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ziqi let
out a light snort. “Ji Ninefire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every Ji clansmen
looked towards Ziqi, while Ninefire said hurriedly, “This is the
final, bottom line of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bottom line?” Ziqi
laughed coldly. “Bottom lines are meant to be broken! Ji Ninefire,
you want to trade the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand
Swords for another official writ? You really are dreaming. Right now,
I’ll give you two options. The first option is that you defy my
Snowdragon Mountain, and your Ji clan wait for annihilation. The
second option is that you hand over the official writ to the City of
Ten Thousand Swords. Our Snowdragon Mountain sect will permit your Ji
clan to continue to live in this area. After the elemental ore mine
has been fully excavated, we will return the official writ to the
City of Ten Thousand Swords to you. This is the promise of myself,
Dong Ziqi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of every
member of the Ji clan changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Promise?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a dogshit promise!
What was a promise worth? Just by a saying a few empty words, he was
demanding that the Ji clan hand over their official writ?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ziqi.” Ninefire
was both furious and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
Ziqi snapped in a fierce voice, his cold, sinister eyes staring at
Ninefire. “You only need to choose…to continue surviving, or to
be annihilated! This is the decision for you to make, Ji Ninefire! If
you choose the annihilation of your clan…well, it has been a long
time since my Eight Trigrams Dragon Blood Formation has truly drawn
blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four Zifu
Disciples by his side all had savage looks flashing in their eyes.
They were born in the main sect, and had each learned some powerful
techniques. Their abilities were quite a bit superior to the
abilities of ordinary, local experts. If they truly were to fight all
out…there were three more Zifu Disciples in their headquarters. In
total, they had eight Zifu Disciples!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose!” Dong Ziqi
said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Ji clan’s
side, some people were so angry that they were trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch!” Some
clansmen called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
Ninefire raised his head, howling heroically. “I, Ji Ninefire, am
ashamed to meet the ancestors of the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ground his teeth,
his entire body trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the distant Dong
Ziqi and the other four, they watched this with cold smiles on their
faces. The decision to give up an ancestral homeland would indeed
cause someone to feel ashamed to meet one’s ancestors. But would
these local bumpkins dare to resist? Resistance meant death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ninefire
suddenly threw out six black spheres, which transformed into six rays
of light, flying directly before Dong Ziqi’s group of five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thunderflame
Pearls!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the other
four were greatly startled. As they came from the main sect, they
immediately recognized these very common and extremely vicious and
sinister Thunderflame Pearls. They contained the power of lightning
and fire, and held extremely explosive force. Once ki caused them to
explode…they would immediately detonate, and the power of the
explosions would be very shocking. The sudden explosion of six
Thunderflame Pearls at a close distance could cause even Zifu
Disciples to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These local bumpkin
clans really do have some treasures. They are actually able to throw
out six Thunderflame Pearls at one go.” Even as Ziqi was
frantically dodging, this thought drifted into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Zifu Disciples
of Snowdragon Mountain quickly separated into separate directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful explosions of
thunder and flame burst forth, and dazzling serpents of electricity
blasted out in every direction, while flames began to burn the entire
area, causing the entire world to shake. The power was indeed
astonishingly fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” A look of
utter savagery was in the eyes of Ninefire, who had just thrown out
those six Thunderflame Pearls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swooosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the desolate
mountain wilderness in the nearby area was surrounded by mist and
fog. Mist and fog appeared everywhere, and even Ning was only able to
see to a distance of ten meters with the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Dong
Ziqi, who had just dodged the last attack and was feeling rather smug
and disdainful, saw the mist which had appeared out of nowhere. His
face instantly changed. “A bewildering formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sly old fellow
threw out those six Thunderflame Pearls not for the purpose of
killing us, but to make sure that the five of us would all put some
distance between us.” Ziqi’s face completely changed. He stared
at the thick mist around him. He could only see to a distance of six
meters with the naked eye. Previously, upon encountering the
Thunderflame Pearls, they had all dodged at full strength, trying to
move as far away as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, those fellow
disciples had all put tens of meters of distance between each other.
As long as they were more than fifteen meters away from each other,
within this bewildering formation, they would be affected by the
master of the formation, resulting in them moving further and further
away from each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ninefire is
planning to completely separate the five of us.” Ziqi was both
frantic and furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!” A distance voice rang out. “It’s a
bewildering formation. We’ve all been separated. Ji Ninefire, that
old bastard, is planning to kill us one by one! They will definitely
have several Zifu Disciples join forces to fight against each of us
one by one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he could hear
the sound, within the bewildering formation, directions constantly
changed, and so he couldn’t tell where it came from at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow apprentices
Ju San, Muse, He Fang, and He Xing, are all of you together?” Ziqi
called out frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m with my older
brother.” A female’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m by myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m alone as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two voices
caused Ziqi’s heart to grow cold. He understood that although He
Fang and his sister were together, Ju San, Muse, and Ziqi himself had
been completely separated. And even if the two He siblings joined
forces…once the Ji clan attacked together, they would also be in
great danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, I really
have fallen into the trap of that old fellow.” Ziqi was both
frantic and furious. “But how could he have set up this formation
in advance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Separated from each
other within the fog of the bewildering formation, the five Zifu
Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain were in a state of panic. At this
time, the Ji clan’s side was both excited and shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, why did
you suddenly attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And
this…this…this…what’s going on with this formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the clansmen
were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire swept everyone
with his gaze, then growled, “My Ji clan isn’t a soft bone for
them to chew on. They are riding on our heads to the point where they
are even pissing and shitting on our faces. How can we possibly take
any more of this? Rather than slink away like cowards, let’s battle
to our heart’s content. In the end, my Ji clan will still have a
chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Obey my orders!”
Ninefire commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the clansmen
awaited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northwind, you go
lead Ji Mo and the others to immediately board our birds to
stealthily leave Swallow Mountain in three different streams.”
Ninefire said. “They will pass down the lineage of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Winterpool,
immediately head to Swallow Mountain City and make a report to the
Grand Xia Dynasty that an elemental ore mine has appeared within the
territory of the Ji clan. I entrust this task to you. Remember,
arrange for multiple messengers. You have to ensure that at least one
group makes it to Swallow Mountain City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire swept the rest
with his gaze. “Everyone else who is not at the Zifu Disciple
level, return to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Leave this place to
us. Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a thud, these
members of the Ji clan all fell to their knees. They looked at
Ninefire, Ning, Truekeep, Yichuan. Although they didn’t say
anything, all of them then quickly left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are the only ones
left here.” Ninefire swept the remaining people with his gaze.
“These five arrogant Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain have
already been separated by my formation. As long as we attack them one
by one, we can completely exterminate them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
looked at Ning. “You are the hope of our Ji clan, and the future of
our Ji clan. If the situation truly grows dire, you are to
immediately use the Traceless Talisman to flee! As long as you
survive, our Ji clan will not be exterminated!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning gritted
his teeth and replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to kill,
then.” Ninefire began to laugh loudly. “It’s been so many years
since I’ve gone wild. I suddenly feel much younger, and filled with
anticipation, like the first time I entered my marital bed!”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, how did
you come up with the idea in advance of setting up a formation?” Ji
Truekeep couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the question
which Ji Ning and the others had on their minds as well. None of them
had seen the Patriarch set up the formation, and after the Zifu
Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain had come over…there was no time to
set up a formation either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire glanced at
the people before him. “When considering matters, one needs to take
a longer view of things. When I first had an inkling of how large
this elemental ore mine was, I grew concerned that it would attract
the greed of Snowdragon Mountain, and so I began to take precautions
against them! What if Snowdragon Mountain came and tried to pressure
us? Thus, early on, I set down the formation in the area around us.
If we didn’t end up fighting, fine. If we did though, then we
naturally have to seize the upper hand. As for why I didn’t tell
the rest of you? If I told you and let you all be aware of the great
formation around us, would you have all displayed such rage and
grief? Snowdragon Mountain’s people probably would have realized,
found the formation, and broken through it long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Ning and
the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning understood as
well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this wasn’t
very strange or mysterious once explained, earlier, everyone had been
stunned and astonished by the size and scale of this elemental ore
mine. None of them, however, had thought to set down a formation
first. This was a matter of experience and foresight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, my
actions cause me to feel ashamed to meet the ancestors of the Ji
clan. I’ve let the Ji clan fall into peril.” Ninefire said in a
low voice. “I didn’t want to choose this path at all. Choosing
this path means fighting Snowdragon Mountain head on. My Ji clan must
sign an agreement as soon as possible with the Grand Xia Dynasty.
Once we sign the agreement, we will at least be guaranteed of a
thousand years of safety. A thousand years from now, I have faith
that our Ji clan would have risen to prominence. Even if we are still
weak though, a thousand years is enough time for our Ji clan to have
made our arrangements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go kill
them, as many as we can. The more we kill, the less pressure our Ji
clan will be under.” Ninefire swept his gaze across everyone.
Granny Shadow. The old servant, Ah Xing. Truekeep. Yichuan. Ning.
These were the top-tier fighters of the Ji clan. “I, Shadow, Ah
Xing, and Ning will join forces to kill the He siblings! Truekeep,
Yichuan, the two of you go deal with Ju San.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Everyone
acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shadow hurriedly asked,
“Then what about Dong Ziqi? He’s a calamity waiting to happen. We
must eradicate him early on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He and Muse have
located each other and joined forces already.” Ninefire said. “We
will deal with them in the end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. I’ll
guide you through the fog.” Ninefire immediately advanced, and
Granny Shadow, Ah Xing, and Ning all followed him. The four of them
were the most powerful four members of the Ji clan. As for Truekeep
and Yichuan, a corridor naturally formed for them through the mist,
and they advanced at high speed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi’s face was
icy and sinister. “I actually fell into the old crook’s scheme.”
In the area around him, eight black crystal balls appeared out of
nowhere, each of which was the size of a person’s skull. Within
them, a faint image of a draconic shadow could be seen swimming
about. The eight bloody trigrams on the black robe he was wearing
immediately radiated a bloody light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bloody light
encompassed those eight distant black crystal balls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One enormous, shadowy,
blood-colored dragon after another appeared in front of Ziqi. There
were eight shadowy blood-colored dragons. They swirled amongst each
other, constantly roving about within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow disciples,
stay where you are and do not move.” Ziqi shouted, while at the
same time, he controlled his Eight Trigram Blood Dragons Formation,
constantly expanding the scope of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the scope of the
formation increased, those eight shadowy blood dragons also swam
about in a wider and wider area. Soon, the width of the formation
reached a scope of three hundred meters, encompassing the nearby Muse
within it as well. This sort of large formation, which spread out in
every direction…made it so that even in a bewildering formation,
there was no way one would be completely bewildered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” The gray-robed man, Muse, said in
surprised delight. He was overjoyed at having been brought within the
perimeters of the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are our other
fellow disciples?” Ziqi looked around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not here.” Muse
shook his head. “I’m the only one within your Eight Trigrams
Blood Dragon Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi ground his
teeth, then immediately called out in a high voice, “I am together
with fellow disciple Muse. He Fang, He Xing, the two of you need to
be careful. And Ju San…take care of yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We siblings aren’t
afraid of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they want to kill
me, I’ll make sure one of them dies as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three voices rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnable.” Dong
Ziqi said unhappily. “We fell into that old crook’s trap.
Otherwise, if the five of us joined forces, how could we be put into
such a situation by the likes of the Ji clan? I myself am able to
kill more than half of them. Junior apprentice-brother Muse, your
accomplishments in the Myriad Ancient Green Vines technique are quite
profound. If you use the Myriad Ancient Green Vines technique, can
you break this formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It would be very
difficult.” Muse shook his head. “Even if I could break it, I
would need a very long time, and I probably wouldn’t have enough ki
energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use it as much as
you can.” Ziqi said. “I have a bottle of ki recovery pills. Take
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Muse
gritted his teeth. “Then I’ll hand over the defense to you,
senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi said confidently,
“You are within my Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Even if
several of them attack together…I have no fear of them. The only
thing I’m afraid of is that they won’t come for me! How
detestable…if I had known earlier, I would’ve started to kill
them from the start. Now, I can’t even find them, even though I
want to kill them.” He, by himself, was equal to his other four
fellow disciples if they joined forces. But unfortunately, although
he had power, he had no place to exert it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse stood there, and a
single seed fell into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many tendrils suddenly
grew out from that seed, wildly spreading out in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bewildering
formations will bewilder the senses.” Muse said in a low voice. “My
vines will be affected by the bewildering formation as well. It will
be hard for them to move in the correct direction. Still, these vines
can constantly grow and expand towards empty areas…as long as they
continuously fill up the area, if they continuously grow, then
naturally they’ll be able to cover the entire formation, and
perhaps even go beyond it. My mind is one with these vines. So long
as the vines are able to leave the formation, I will know it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But what I don’t
know is how large this formation is. After all, when the diameter
expands tenfold, the number of tendrils I need to grow is increased a
hundredfold. The larger the formation is, the more exhausting it will
be for my Ki.” Muse didn’t feel much confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go all out.”
Ziqi gritted his teeth. “Trapped here, the only thing that will
happen is that we will be butchered as they please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Muse
didn’t say anything further, striving to expand and empower his
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle, rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless vines
frantically grew out and elongated, but in the bewildering formation,
where they had no sense of direction, these vines grew out in a wild,
unorderly manner as well. Still, one thing was certain…they were to
grow in the direction of areas where there were no vines! To cover as
much new space as they could!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In another area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninefire, and the
others were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The He siblings are
up front.” Ninefire said. “I’ll launch the first attack, and
then part open the mist. You will see the two of them. All of you,
immediately use killing attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than seven hundred
sword-type magic treasures suddenly appeared in the area around Ning,
each of which glowed with a hazy white light. The swords gently ebbed
and flowed, unceasingly summoning and coalescing the power of the
world. Ning’s ki was constantly being transformed through these
magic swords as well, and in front of him, a dazzling, eye-catching
white sword light had taken form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] - Level Nine!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a sharp sword
light.” Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the old servant, Ah Xing, were
shocked. Although they hadn’t interacted with it, they could sense
how sharp this sword light was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow pointed
with her finger, and in front of her, three flying swords appeared as
well, each of which glowed with a faint, fiery light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to her, the old
servant Ah Xing lifted his hand, and a warhammer appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do it.”
Ninefire waved his hand, and a mottled, five-colored flying sword
suddenly pierced through the air. Ninefire was famous for using
poisons and formations…although this flying sword was a ranked
magic treasure, to be more precise, it was a poison sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred meters in
front of Ning, He Fang and He Xing, brother and sister, were present.
The two had used a number of Dao-seals, and their bodies were covered
by golden light. At the same time, two magic treasures were
constantly flying around them, one which looked like an iron pestle,
while the other was a strange-looking tiled jar magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t see our
surroundings. They will definitely ambush us. Be careful.” The
green-haired man, He Fang, said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” His
younger sister, He Xing, was incomparably cautious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A five-colored flying
sword suddenly descended at an astonishing speed. However, as the He
siblings were constantly on-guarded, they immediately used their
techniques to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The floating tiled jar
suddenly emitted a large amount of green liquid into a watery
curtain, which was incomparably tough and unyielding. Once the
five-colored flying sword pierced into the curtain of green liquid,
the speed of it immediately slowed greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three flying swords
glowing with fiery light slashed through the skies as well. It was
the three flying swords of Granny Shadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This instantly caused
the faces of He Fang and He Xing, brother and sister, to change
greatly. They hurriedly worked to block it as well, but the water
curtain was beginning to be unable to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” An enormous
black warhammer, carrying even more incomparably ferocious power,
smashed straight through the quivering water curtain, and then
smashed onto the golden light covering the body of He Xing, the
younger sister. The golden light instantly trembled violently, as
though it was about to shatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, let’s run.
If we stay here, we’re just going to serve as punching bags.” He
Fang and He Xing, after having suffered successive strikes, had begun
to panic. Clearly, there were quite a few enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling sword light
suddenly slashed out in a lonely arc, leaving behind a beautiful,
dreary afterimage as it instantly pierced through the quivering
barrier of golden light covering He Xing’s body…

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning’s
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] sword light swept down towards
them, the graceful, lithe-bodied He Xing’s face changed. “What a
terrifying sword light! There’re no other options!” Her green
hair suddenly emitted a dazzling green light while at the same time,
her entire body dimly glowed with a green aura. As for that sword
light which had just pierced through the golden aura protecting her
body, it clashed straight against that green aura. The green aura
trembled, and rippling runes appeared on its surface, but in the end,
with a boom, it blew apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining energy in
the sword light was quite weak now, so weak that it wasn’t even
able to pierce through the protective magic treasure He Xing was
wearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Brother! The
talisman which Master gave us was broken through in just one attack.”
He Xing said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was too
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of that sword
light was most likely close to that of a casual blow from a Wanxiang
Adept. Even the talisman her master had given her to protect her was
only able to take a single blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister, let’s
go all out.” Mu Fang gritted his teeth. “We can’t hope for a
lucky break to occur. We have to treat this as our potential tomb,
for us to have a chance of surviving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Xing
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of resoluteness
appeared in the eyes of these two siblings. Their auras grew savage,
and a layer of bloody light arose on their skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forbidden arts!”
The distant attackers, Ji Ninefire, Ji Ning, Granny Shadow, the old
servant Ah Xing saw this, and their faces changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forbidden arts…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
they referred to forbidden techniques that were used through
sacrificing one’s own lifespan. They could only be used at enormous
cost, and once the cost was made, it was very hard to recover from
it. But precisely because the cost was great, the power one had upon
using a forbidden art would rapidly rise as ewll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to kill us?
Come, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having used a
forbidden technique, He Xing and He Fang both had savagery in their
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are like
trapped beasts right now.” Ninefire hurriedly sent mentally to the
others. “Although they are surrounded and attacked by us, they are
still Zifu Disciples, and they’ve used forbidden techniques. If we
aren’t careful, some of us might die. We have to be cautious. We
have the advantage. I’d rather we give up some opportunities than
risk our lives. We just have to find a single good opportunity, at
which point we can kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Granny
Shadow narrowed her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old servant, Ah
Xing, just stared at the distant He siblings, controlling that great
warhammer of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
unleashed a second sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four were working
together!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They wildly attacked
the He siblings in unison. Amongst these five enemy Zifu Disciples,
the He siblings actually had only average strength; they were ranked
behind Dong Ziqi and Muse! As for Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ah
Xing, they were old fellows who had lived for nearly four centuries,
each of whom were actually a good amount more powerful than the He
siblings. And that’s not even mentioning the monstrous Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only through using
forbidden arts were the He siblings capable of just barely holding
off the joint attacks of these four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despicable, sly Ji
clansmen.” He Fang and He Xing were cursing wildly while
controlling their magic treasures to resist. Because they had used
forbidden arts, their ability to control magic treasures had clearly
increased…in particular, the water curtain which flew out from the
tiled jar was actually able to resist Ning’s [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning to
sigh in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His enemies were Zifu
Disciples, while he himself only had peak Xiantian-level Ki. For him
to be able to fight against someone at a higher level who was even
using forbidden arts…the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] should
be proud of itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Brother, that
Ji Ning is too powerful.” He Xing had a look of despair in her
eyes. “Even going all out, I’m only able to block him alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m almost unable
to hold out any longer as well.” He Fang was simultaneously
blocking the other three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same instant, He
Fang and He Xing each released a Dao-seal radiating a black light
from their hands. They instantly activated the pair of Dao-seals,
which immediately transformed into tens of rays of black light which
quickly attacked Ninefire and the other three! Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and the old servant Ah Xing were shocked, and they hurriedly
used what abilities they had to resist. As for Ning, he wielded two
swords in his hands, with the Waterflame Lotus swiveling around his
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boomboomboom…”
The rays of black light pierced directly through the Waterflame
Lotus, but were blocked by Ning’s Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning couldn’t
help but stagger backwards, taking six heavy steps back, the ground
cracking with each step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
stared at his waist. A large hole had been pierced through his waist,
but in the blink of an eye, his flesh quickly grew out, regenerating
the wound and not leaving behind a single scar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, it’s good
that we have you. Otherwise, that technique alone would have wounded
us, and perhaps one of us would even have died.” Ninefire was
frightened as well. That black light had simply been too fast. Once
it pierced through their bodies…the other three were all Ki
Refiners. If they weren’t careful, they would lose their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow sent
mentally as well, “These two really live up to their reputation as
being members from the main sect. They have so many techniques. If we
aren’t careful, we might fall to one of them. Let’s pull away
slightly; at a longer distance, it’ll be easier for us to deal with
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninefire
nodded. “The two of them are close to the breaking point. If we
keep it up a little longer, they will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch and the
other two were all Zifu-level Ki Refiners. They didn’t dare fight
in close quarters combat, because in close quarters combat, if one
suffered an attack that was too fast and which didn’t give one a
chance to dodge, one could easily die. It was correct for them to
decide to pull away…but Ning himself was a Fiendgod Body Refiner!
How long would it take for them to continue wasting time like this?
They had to end this quickly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, leave it
to me.” Ning shouted mentally to them, while at the same time, a
pair of wing-type magic treasures appeared out of nowhere on his
back. The wings fluttered, and Ning soared into the air like a giant
Roc, instantly appearing in front of He Fang and He Xing, the two
siblings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing were all shocked, but they knew
that Ning was a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and that he trained in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. They weren’t too
worried about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect timing.”
He Fang and He Xing, the two siblings, were startled, then delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, they had
been filled with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the others
had been too crafty; they had insisted on fighting at a distance, not
giving the two of them a chance to fight back! The two were all but
standing there and letting others beat down on them. They didn’t
dare to make the slightest mistake, because if they did, the enemies
would seize the chance to kill them. But who could forever be perfect
and never make a mistake? Just as they were feeling despair, Ji Ning
charged over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After killing you,
our deaths would have been worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The genius of the Ji
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The He siblings had
gone mad in their desire to kill Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning, moving like a
giant Roc, arced outwards in a curving, solitary line as he attacked
He Xing. His target was her, as she had already used up a protective
talisman. In front of Ning, there was a flash of sword light, and the
Darknorth swords in his hands executed his most powerful attack…Rain
Line!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light flashed
outwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He Xing’s beautiful
head was sent flying into the air, her eyes still filled with
disbelief and shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…” The
nearby He Fang stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a wound on
Ning’s head, which carved straight through his forehead, but this
wound quickly healed. The reason why he was able to kill He Xing, a
Zifu Disciple, in a single exchange was not only that Ning’s
swordplay vastly outstripped the opponent’s; it was also because
Ning fought in a way where the two of them would both take ‘lethal’
wounds, allowing her to stab him with her sword. This was why he was
able to kill her in a single exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…have reached
the Zifu Disciple level as a Fiendgod as well?” He Fang didn’t
dare believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing a Fiendgod Body
Refiner was far more difficult than killing a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
used the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], which was clearly a Ki
Refiner technique. And Ning was only sixteen years old…He Fang and
He Xing had both believed that given his age, Ning should only have
opened his Violet Palace as a Ki Refiner! He most likely had yet to
be able to open his Violet Palace as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and
should only be a Xiantian-stage lifeform. Generally speaking, a
Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiner’s head was still a critical
area. Even someone who trained in the number one technique, the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], would have to reach the
peak Xiantian level before having no critical areas anywhere in the
body. That was why He Xing had wanted to sacrifice her life in that
exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister.” He
Fang stared at the corpse on the ground, then suddenly let out a
heroic howl. “Senior apprentice-brother Ziqi, avenge us and
annihilate the Ji clan!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back.” Ning’s
face changed, and his wing-type magic treasure fluttered as he
frantically retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He Fang suddenly
exploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Violet Palace
in his body was like an enormous lake which contained endless amounts
of lake water. This lake water was actually liquefied ki energy! When
He Fang detonated his Zifu ‘lake’, all of the liquefied ki energy
that had accumulated in his Zifu instantly transformed into usable
Ki. Even if his body had to blow apart, he wanted to make this
liquefied ki instantly transform and blast outwards. The power of
this elemental blast was simply terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The savage, boundless
wave of ki spread out, rippling in every direction! Instantly, the
turbid wave of elemental ki blasted into the frantically retreating
Ji Ning, submerging him within it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
distant Ji Ninefire and the other two were shocked.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - Two More Remaining
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning had
sensed in advance that something bad was going to happen, and thus
had immediately used the Windwing Evasion to retreat, he was still
struck on the back by the enormous surge of power, and his entire
body was knocked helplessly flying, smashing a deep crater into the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ji Ninefire
and the other two hurriedly flew over, staring into that deep crater
with concern. Ning lay deep within the crater, fresh, crimson blood
splattered everywhere. The wing-type magic treasure on his back was
already twisted…but within the crater, Ning was quickly recovering.
He stretched his hand out, lifting himself upwards and quickly
returning to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine.” Ning
said hoarsely. That earlier explosive force had damaged even his
throat. As he arose from the deep crater, the various wounds on his
back were quickly healing, and the terrifying injuries his body had
sustained were rapidly regenerating. Moments later, not even a scar
could be seen. As for Ning’s protective magic armor, it quickly
reformed into the shape of the beast fur clothes his mother had made
for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ninefire
and the other two to sigh in amazement. This was what Ki Refiners
like them envied the most with regards to Fiendgod Body Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was them, they
probably would have died long ago!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of a
detonating Zifu ‘lake’ truly is terrifying.” Ning sighed in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Establishing the
‘Violet Palace’ was part of the Immortal path. The Zifu was like
a lake that contained liquefied ki energy. The Zifu lake was thus the
foundation for an Immortal practitioner! A fruit tree that wished to
bloom and birth fruits had to have a patch of land, while Immortal
practitioners who wished to reach the Wanxiang level or become a
Primal Immortal…had to have a Zifu lake! This was their foundation.
Zifu Disciples would constantly accumulate their ki energy, expanding
the size of that lake…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But once the
accumulated ki energy was detonated, the first to die from the
explosion iwould be the practitioner! Only then would others be hit
by the explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is why the
three of us didn’t dare to attack in close combat. Only you, a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, would dare draw near.” Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.” Ning
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lifeforce
possessed by Fiendgods truly is astonishing.” Granny Shadow said
hoarsely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a different area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight shadowy blood
dragons of the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation roved about
sinuously. In the center were Muse and Dong Ziqi. Ziqi had a gloomy
look on his face, and his eyes were filled with a boundless killing
intent. He truly wished to charge out and kill them. But that group
of Ji clan cowards didn’t dare to come face him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister!
Senior apprentice-brother Ziqi, avenge us and annihilate the Ji
clan!!!” A fierce voice suddenly rang out, and then…a deafening,
massive explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse, seated in the
lotus position, opened his eyes, which were filled with a look of
sorrow. “The He siblings are dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not only dead; he
even detonated his own Zifu lake. He was forced into dire straits.”
Ziqi’s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were filled with rage. He,
Dong Ziqi, had actually been forced into such a terrible situation,
and by the puny little Ji clan. This caused the look on Ziqi’s face
to become all the more terrible. He howled savagely, “I, Dong Ziqi,
swear that I will definitely annihilate the Ji clan! Definitely!”
His roar rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will definitely
annihilate the Ji clan! Definitely!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning heard this, his
face changed slightly. He could sense the wild savagery and killing
intent held within this shout. By his side, Ninefire just said
coldly, “If we didn’t kill them, they would still annihilate our
Ji clan for not handing over the official writ! If they want to kill
us, then they need to be prepared for the possibility that we might
kill them. Screaming loudly now is the act of a coward.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s go
deal with Dong Ziqi.” Granny Shadow ground her teeth, speaking in a
hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The old
servant, Ah Xing, acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
boundless killing intent as well…against these enemy forces who
wanted to annihilate the Ji clan and give them no options, Ning
wouldn’t feel a hint of pity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
just frowned. “Immediately go to your father’s place. Assist them
in killing Ju San.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Can it be that his
father, Ji Yichuan, and Ji Truekeep had met with trouble in their
combined effort to deal with that ‘Jusan’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Muse.”
Ninefire said urgently. “Muse is currently using a magical
technique, causing a large number of vines to rapidly grow out
nonstop. They’ve already grown near the place where your father is.
Once those vines encounter Ju San…! Dong Ziqi and Muse will quickly
follow the vines and rejoin with Ju San! Once the three join forces,
it will be even more difficult to kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A path through the mist
had already appeared in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go.” Ning
transformed into a blurred shadow, quickly advancing forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll go deal with
Dong Ziqi and Muse.” Ninefire looked towards Granny Shadow and Ah
Xing. “We don’t have to kill them, but we need to disturb that
Muse…ideally, making it so that Muse won’t be able to continue to
use that technique of his. Those vines have grown so large…Muse
definitely had to use up quite a bit of mental energy and Ki.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Granny
Shadow and Ah Xing both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three quickly
hurried towards Ziqi…and as for Ning, as he flew forward, he saw
the vines rapidly growing, but by relying on the Windwing Evasion, he
was able to dodge past them and not touch them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, the
sound of explosions could be heard, and the fog grew thin as well.
Ning saw two figures standing in the distance; it was his own father,
Yichuan, and his clansman, Truekeep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Father isn’t
using any magic treasures. Can it be that Father hasn’t established
his Zifu yet?” As Ning hurried over, he discovered that Truekeep
was currently controlling magic treasures to battle against that
muscular man named Ju San, while Ning’s father, Yichuan, was
brandishing his sword, releasing one last after another of sword
light, each of which flowed out like a stream of water, constantly
racing towards that muscular Ju San. Those blasts of sword light
seemed like entangling threads, constantly restricting and binding Ju
San.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep was the main
force, while Yichuan was support!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnable.” Ju San
bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From what the
Patriarch previously said, it seems as though my father is a Zifu
Disciple. But why is it that I’ve never seen Father ride on a magic
treasure?” Ning was puzzled. “In fact, that year, when I suffered
the attack from Serpentwing, when Father pursued Serpentwing, he
didn’t ride on a magic treasure back then either. What’s the
reason for this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had asked his
father before, but his father had refused to answer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After this battle,
I’ll ask the Patriarch.” Ning buried these doubts in his heart,
while at the same time, a pair of Darknorth swords appeared in his
hands, while the wings on his back fluttered, sending him piercing
through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, when He
Fang had detonated his own Zifu Lake, the previous pair of wing-type
magic treasures had been destroyed, but fortunately, Ning had quite a
few sets of these unranked treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Uncle
Truekeep! Leave this Ju San to me!” Ning shouted loudly, then
transformed into a ray of light, charging towards Ju San.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Truekeep
both turned to look. “Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, perfect!”
From afar, mighty Ju San, who had power but no place to expend it,
watched as Ning charged towards him. He was overjoyed! He was a Zifu
Fiendgod Body Refiner! Fiendgod Body Refiners loved to engage in
close quarters combat. Prior to this, Truekeep and Yichuan had
continuously kept far away from him, and he, Ju San, was not
proficient in movement techniques, and thus was completely unable to
catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be constantly beaten
down on, but be unable to catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What sort of torment
was this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had opened
up his Zifu as a Ki Refiner as well, he hadn’t spent too much time
and effort on learning how to ride magic treasures. His primary
efforts had been expended on close quarters combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come, come.
Let me take a look at this genius of the Ji clan and see how powerful
you are.” Behind Ju San, a pair of black wings had appeared. As he
went forward to engage Ning, he clearly was quite agile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wing-type magic
treasure?” Ning looked at the pair of wings on Ju San’s back, and
his eyes couldn’t help but light up. The vast majority of Fiendgod
Body Refiners would use wings, so as to make them more agile. “It
should be a ranked magic treasure. I was worrying about how, after
breaking through to the Zifu level, I wouldn’t have any ranked
wing-type magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two people. One came
from the main sect of Snowdragon Mountain, and although he trained in
a fairly ordinary Fiendgod Body Refining technique, known as the
[Mighty Demon - Introductory], he was an early Zifu Disciple.
Although the name of this technique seemed quite ordinary, it was
quite a bit superior to the techniques the Ji clan possessed, such as
the [Sutra of the Future Buddha] or [Indestructible Blood Fiend],
even though those techniques had more impressive-sounding names.
Generally speaking, the more powerful a sect was, the more modest the
names their techniques would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
person, this person trained in the technique that even in the
Fiendgod Era was the indisputable number one Fiendgod Body Refining
technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. But this
person was only a peak Xiantian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!” “BANG!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ju San was wielding a
greataxe, while Ning was wielding a pair of swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two exchanged
blows…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a pair of
juvenile Fiendgods from back in the Primordial Era who were fighting
against each other. Instantly, the earth began to quake, then split
apart, sending rocks flying everywhere! The two both had wing-type
magic treasures behind them, and they they wildly battled each other
in close quarters combat, completely unafraid of the occasional
wounds they suffered. As for Ju San’s body, one wound after another
appeared atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ju San’s
axecraft is quite impressive. The greataxe is very large, making it
so that when it defends, it is almost like a buckler.” Ning said to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has actually
reached the Zifu level as a Fiendgod practitioner as well.” Ju San
was even more shocked. “And his usage of dual swords is all the
more marvelous and skilled. I’ve focused on my axecraft for nearly
a century, but I actually can’t compare to his swordcraft! I’m at
a disadvantage with every exchange…” Right now, he had only left
two wounds on Ning’s body, and that was only because Ning had
willingly accepted the blow in order to deliver one to him as well.
But as for Ju San, his body had suffered over a hundred wounds on it
by now. But of course, all of them had healed automatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swordplay
became even more ferocious and wild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster, faster,
faster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that as
the opponent used a heavy weapon, the greataxe, he himself had to
fight based on his speed. The faster Ning was, the more flaws the
enemy would reveal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Like the wind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Like the flame!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s left and right
hands each held a sword, but they used completely different swordplay
techniques. One sword was as illusory as the wind, while the other
sword was as aggressively scorching as a flame. Both of them were
shockingly fast, and the two worked in unison, creating a explosive
combination. The power of the two techniques multiplied, feeding off
each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster! Even
faster!” Ning battled wildly against Ju San, raining down blows
upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ju San’s movements
became disordered, unable to keep up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SLASH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword blow that was
as strangely agile and graceful as the wind slashed past the
greataxe, and also slashed through Jusan’s waist. Crunch. Blood
flew everywhere, and Ju San was bisected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s my chance.”
Ning instantly entered a berserk mode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunderflash Flint!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunderflash Flint!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunderflash Flint!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two swords
simultaneously executed this technique. There was nothing weird about
this technique, nothing savage about it; all it had was speed! One
ray after another of sword light wildly chopped down on the bisected
halves of Ju San’s body, causing Ju San’s body to constantly
shatter, but Ju San’s head continued to roar, “It won’t be so
easy to kill a Fiendgod Body Refiner!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus.”
Ning executed his final, killing stroke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those countless pieces
of Ju San’s body became enveloped within a Waterflame Lotus. The
petals of the fire and water slowly swiveled against each other.
After five years of training, the murderous grinding power of Ning’s
Waterflame Lotus had reached a terrifyingly strong level. These
completely defenseless chunks of bloody flesh were completely ground
into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grind! Grind! Grind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pieces of bloody
flesh tried frantically to reconnect to each other, reforming into a
person. But they were constantly being ground down by the Waterflame
Lotus!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chunks of bloody
flesh were completely ground to dust, completely unable to reform
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ju San! Dead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looks like I
acquired a set of ranked wing-type magic treasures in advance.”
Ning stretched his hand out, collecting the nearby spoils, including
the wing-type magic treasures, the greataxe, the protective
magic-terasures, and the various other magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep and Yichuan
stood there watching from afar, looks of disbelief and shock on their
faces. They had watched as two Fiendgod experts battled wildly and
viciously against each other…it was power against power, and as
soon as one fell, the other wildly charged forward to dismember him,
giving him no chance at all to recover. Fortunately, Ning had his
Waterflame Lotus, as otherwise it would have been hard for him to so
quickly dispose of this Ju San.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
said hurriedly. “Father, Uncle Truekeep, we need to hurry up and
rejoin the Patriarch. There are only two more remaining!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ther are only two
more remaining?” Truekeep and Yichuan were excited as well. They
hadn’t imagined that in this battle, the Ji clan would actually
have achieved such a glorious success, with only two Zifu Disciples
remaining now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was the
most powerful two!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yichuan, and
Truekeep transferred into rays of light, hurrying back to regroup
with Ninefire and the others…

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A faint fog surrounded
the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, and one shadowy blood
dragon after another swam about, look towards Ji Ning, Ji Ninefire,
and the rest of the six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, don’t
charge in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to give him a
try.” With a thought, Ning summoned more than seven hundred
weapon-type magic treasures, which undulated up and down in the air
around him, all of them radiating a dim glow. In front of Ning formed
an irresistible, unblockable sword light. With a thought, the sword
light formed from the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] shot through
the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] - Level Nine!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dazzling sword
light charged straight into the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon
Formation, and in the instant that it did so, the shadowy blood
dragons immediately bellowed and charged forth.
Cracklecracklecrackle…the sword light just managed to eradicate a
single shadowy blood dragon before the power of the sword light was
used up, but soon, the shadowy blood dragon once more reformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.” Ning was
amazed. “I was only able to destroy a single dragon? And it almost
immediately reformed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi, within the
formation, gave the distant Ning a cold, insidious look. In a hoarse
voice, he said, “You live up to your reputation as being the genius
of the Ji clan. Only sixteen years old…and yet you are able to
destroy one of the dragons of my Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon
Formation. However, the little bit of power you have is far from
being sufficient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, don’t charge
in.” Ninefire sent mentally in a frantic voice. “This sort of
formation is perfectly suited to countering Fiendgod Body Refiners.
As soon as you charge within, you’ll be attacked by all eight of
those blood dragons, and they will rip you to pieces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Fiendgod Body
Refiners were superior to Ki Refiners…there was no such thing as an
absolute truth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refiners had their
powerful experts as well, who were able to fight against those at a
higher level as them. The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was one
such example! Or, for example, those Ki Refiners who bred countless
venomous pests, which would be released out in a flood, devouring
everything in their path. Fiengod Body Refiners were more powerful,
yes…but that was as a whole. On an individual level, there were
incomparably glorious and talented Ki Refiners as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The six of us should
join forces to attack and see if we have any chance of winning.” A
killing intent flashed through the eyes of Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying sword flew
through the air!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Venomous bugs danced
out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword light pierced
forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, the
entire world seemed to be filled with various techniques and attacks,
which flew towards the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Within
the formation, Ziqi laughed wildly. “Excellent!” Those eight
shadowy blood dragons, which had been peacefully swimming about,
suddenly turned savage as they charged forward to welcome those
attacks. They blocked one magic treasure after another, and as some
of the dragons dispersed, they quickly reformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight shadowy blood
dragons coiled about in a circular rhythm, forcibly taking on the
attacks of Ning and the rest of the six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cowards of the Ji
clan, if you have any ability, come into my Eight Trigrams Blood
Dragon Formation.” Seeing that the attacks had been completely
blocked, Dong Ziqi, standing within the formation, became even more
arrogant. “You killed three of my fellow disciples because you had
the advantage of numbers. In terms of actual ability, how could your
Ji clan be a match for us? If we were to really fight, I, Dong Ziqi,
would be able to annihilate you all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Eight
Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, Ninefire, Granny Shadow, Ah Xing,
Yichuan, Truekeep, and Ning were astonished at the power of this
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
Ninefire sent mentally. “Although I have long heard of the power of
Dong Ziqi’s Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, I’ve never
fought against it. It seems that the eight dragons within the
formation are all comparable to a peak Zifu Disciple. With the eight
joining forces…the power is truly astonishing. Even if the six of
us truly want to go all out and kill him, most likely three of us
would die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing in
life that has no risk.” Granny Shadow sent. “Let’s kill this
Dong Ziqi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan has too
few Zifu Disciples! But Snowdragon Mountain has plenty of them. It
isn’t worth it for us to die alongside these two.” Ninefire
refuted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having attacked
for the amount of time needed to brew tea, although Ning had only
occasionally released an attack from his [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], the ki energy in his body was more than half used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold your attacks.”
Ninefire sent. “We’ve attacked together for so long now, but we
haven’t had a single chance for breaking through. If we don’t
take any risks, we won’t be able to kill Dong Ziqi. In addition,
those vines are constantly growing outwards. Soon, they’ll have
exited the perimeters of my bewildering formation. Forget it. We’ll
just let them go this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let them go?”
Truekeep’s eyes were filled with disbelief. “Patriarch, if we
lose this opportunity, in the future, Dong Ziqi will definitely come
together with other Zifu Disciples. Killing him will be even more
difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fool.” Ninefire
sent furiously. “We aren’t trying to annihilate Snowdragon
Mountain. What we are trying to do…is to let the Ji clan survive
for a longer period of time! The six of us need to endure for as long
as we can, to endure until the Grand Xia Dynasty’s Celestial Envoy
arrives! Once we sign our agreement, then we will have succeeded. Our
lives are more important than Dong Ziqi’s life! If we go all out
and three of us die so that we eventually kill the two of them…when
Snowdragon Mountain comes for revenge, they’ll come with an entire
group of Zifu Disciples. By then, how can the remaining people delay
for any longer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep instantly came
to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing the enemy was
secondary. What really mattered for the Ji clan was to overcome this
tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to endure and
survive until the Grand Xia Dynasty’s Celestial Envoy arrived! As
for killing the Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain, that was a
secondary goal. Killing a few extra Zifu Disciples would reduce their
future pressure, but if today, they suffered too many losses, then it
wouldn’t be worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, Dong Ziqi was feeling taut and
nervous as well. As the saying goes, it is hard for a pair of hands
to fight off two pairs. He was faced with the attacks of six Zifu
Disciples, each of which was displaying numerous techniques which
filled the skies. Just now, he had just barely blocked the attacks of
these six. If the Ji clan’s forces were to use forbidden arts to go
all out…he would be in great danger as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I die, I’ll
drag them down with me.” Dong Ziqi’s eyes flashed with wildness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” Seated in the lotus position, the
ashen-faced Muse suddenly opened his eyes, a look of wild joy within
them. “My vines have already extended to beyond the bewildering
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ziqi was stunned, and
then he was overjoyed as well. “We can leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could live, of
course he would rather live than fight to the death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense the
location of that vine. By following my senses, we can charge straight
out.” Muse hurriedly rose to his feet. “Senior apprentice-brother
Ziqi, control the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. We’re
going to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A green leaf appeared
out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green leaf extended
to the size of multiple meters, and Muse and Ziqi stepped atop the
leaf. Around them, those eight bloody dragons continued to swim
about. Clearly Ziqi was continuously maintaining the Eight Trigrams
Blood Dragon Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green leaf began to
fly in a strange, zig-zagging manner, occasionally advancing, then
retreating, then turning, then retreating, then retreating, then
advancing…the movements were completely bizarre. But in truth, this
was caused by the disruptions to their sense of direction within the
formation. Although it seemed as though they were constantly changing
directions, in truth, they were moving towards the outside this
entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing atop the leaf,
Muse and Ziqi suddenly saw the desolate mountain forests outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re out. We made
it out.” Ziqi and Muse both had looks of surprise and joy on their
faces. They had been trapped within the bewildering formation and
unable to escape, giving their enemies complete control over what to
do. That was indeed quite torturous. Now that they had escaped, they
naturally felt incomparably jubilant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan!” Ziqi
gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse’s face was
sinister as well. “Three of my fellow disciples have died miserable
deaths here. How can we not avenge this great enmity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan!” Dong
Ziqi’s voice echoed for hundreds of kilometers. “Just wait for
your clan to be annihilated!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A green leaf instantly
slashed through the skies, quickly disappearing into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And as it did, six
figures walked out from within the bewildering formation. It was
Ninefire and the other five. Ninefire turned to look towards the
distant, desolate mountain forests, and he spied several figures from
afar. Ninefire said in a booming voice, “Riverbank clan, Kou clan,
Blackfire Sect…” As soon as he spoke, one figure after another
flew over at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive us for being
unable to assist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ninefire, it
wasn’t appropriate for us to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One mental voice after
another was sent over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, those figures
mounted on their magic treasures and flew away, departing. All of the
Zifu Disciples of the various powers in the Swallow Mountain region
had been drawn here by those earlier elemental waves of energy.
Although they weren’t able to see the battle between the Ji clan
and Snowdragon Mountain, they were able to guess what had happened.
In particular, upon hearing Dong Ziqi’s final, angry words, they
could tell what those words had implied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Watching as
those figures left, Ninefire shook his head. “This elemental ore
mine has major implications. It will definitely draw the attention of
even more Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain. No wonder the
Blackfire Sect, the Riverbank clan, and the Kou clan weren’t
willing to interfere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Swallow Mountain
region, the Ji clan, the Blackfire Sect, the Riverbank clan, and the
Kou clan were allied with each other, and they jointly resisted
Snowdragon Mountain and the Ironwood clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But what they jointly
resisted was the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain! But
this elemental ore mine…soon, the Zifu Disciples of the main
Snowdragon Mountain Sect would come to attack Swallow Mountain, and
when that happened, for them to annihilate the Blackfire Sect,
Riverbank clan, and Kou clan would be simplicity itself. Of course
they didn’t dare interfere. No matter how great the benefits might
be, they still wouldn’t dare to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, what
should we do now?” Truekeep spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
turned to look at their Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said slowly,
“This time, the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain has
suffered severe losses. Three of their Zifu Disciples are dead. They
will definitely invite their comrades from throughout the region to
have them hurry over here. Given the allure of this elemental ore
mine, there will be a large group of Zifu Disciples who will attack
Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They will definitely
invite those nearest Swallow Mountain. Given the speed of Zifu
Disciples, they’ll probably arrive in just a day or two.”
Ninefire said. “We have two options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first option.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can hide.”
Ninefire said. “We can make it so that the Zifu Disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain are unable to find it. We only need to hide for a
few days, and wait for the Angel arrives to sign a transfer agreement
with us. This is a fairly safe route…but it will thrust the
countless clansmen of our Ji clan into mortal danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Zifu Disciples
will be here soon, within just a day or two. In just a short day or
two, the hundreds of thousands of tribesmen and clansmen belonging to
our Ji clan won’t be able to make it far.” Ji Ninefire sighed.
“When the group of Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain find that
they are unable to locate us, to give vent to their rage, they will
massacre our clansmen, or perhaps seize them and sell them off as
slaves. This is normal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Ning and
the others all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of thousands
of their compatriots!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second option.”
Ninefire said. “We publicly state that we will be in a certain
location, and that we will set up a formation there. We publicly
declare…that Snowdragon Mountain can come and kill us there, if
they are able to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
is a major sect. Sects like them care deeply about their reputation.
If we publicly set up this formation, once their Zifu Disciples come,
they will definitely attack the formation full force in an attempt to
break it. They won’t lower themselves to go slaughter a group of
mortals. If they did so, once the word spread, this would be a great
stain on Snowdragon Mountain’s reputation. But if we hide,
resulting in them being unable to find the ‘culprits’, they will
definitely massacre the people of the Ji clan, so as to demonstrate
how the supremacy of Snowdragon Mountain is not to be challenged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Major sects cared about
their reputation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they hid, then those
Zifu Disciples would use the excuse of wanting to demonstrate how the
supremacy of their sect was not to be challenged, and go massacre the
members of the Ji clan, so as to warn others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if the Ji clan’s
experts stood out and openly proclaimed they would be at a certain
location within a formation, then the enemies would no longer be able
to go act against those ordinary mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, speak.
What choice should we make?” Ninefire looked at his clansmen.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 24 - The Stone Room Within the Mine
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Misty fog coiling
about, Ji Ning just stood there, looking at his five elders. The
Patriarch, his father, and the others were all very calm. Clearly,
they had already made their decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the Patriarch.”
Ji NInefire said very calmly. “For the sake of the Ji clansmen. For
the sake of the Ji clan’s reputation! I will stand out and welcome
this battle with Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow said in
her hoarse voice, “I’ve lived nearly four hundred years. Can it
be that I, Ji Shadow, am going to hide so as to live for a few more
years while watching my clansmen fall into danger? In addition, I
feel very happy that I’ll be able to face death with my elder
brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wherever my mistress
is, I shall be there.” The old servant, Ah Xing, actually spoke
out, a rare event indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s enough for we
three old fellows to be there.” Ninefire smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch!”
Truekeep spoke out. “I know the limits of my own talent. Even
amongst the Zifu Disciples of the Ji clan, I am only average. It’s
virtually impossible for me to become a Wanxiang Adept! This
battle…is the most critical battle which will determine the fate of
my Ji clan. I cannot hide from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan smiled as well.
“Patriarch, you know my situation as well. My Immortal path is
shattered. I don’t want to die a silent, meaningless death. I must
participate in this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you…”
Ninefire shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Immortal path was
shattered?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Didn’t his father
always say that his heart was focused on following the Immortal path?
Why did that change?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, you said
your Immortal path is shattered?” Ning stared at his father in
disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
son, a rather complicated look on his face. “Actually, while
adventuring in the Darknorth Sea, I had already broken through to the
Zifu Disciple level. Afterwards, when your mother became pregnant
with you, I had already reached to the middle Zifu level. I led your
mother, wanting to return to Swallow Mountain, but your maternal
uncle was worried, so he escorted us back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened intently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that a calamity
had occurred on the way back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, we met
with a disaster.” Yichuan said. “Your mother was badly injured,
but your Uncle White led you back. Your uncle and I both executed
forbidden arts, using all our might to delay the enemy! During that
battle, your uncle died while I was badly injured. Because I used a
forbidden art for too long a period of time, the damage done to my
Zifu Violet Palace was too great, and my Violet Palace became warped
and atrophied, unable to expand again in the future. In other words,
it is impossible for me to increase my power. I will forever remain a
mid-level Zifu Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of the
atrophication of my Zifu, I’m only able to draw out a hint of the
ki energy within my Zifu.” Yichuan shook his head. “There’s no
way I can ride on a magic treasure with just that tiny strand of Ki!
Thus, I focus on my swordplay, with that strand of ki being the
foundation of it. I draw forth the power of the world with every
single blow of sword light.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course.”
Yichuan said somberly. “I can still use a forbidden art one more
time, forcibly drawing out a large amount of ki energy from within my
Zifu. But given how my Zifu is already warped…there’s no need to
repeat what I said earlier. Once I use a forbidden art, most likely
within one hour, my Zifu will completely shatter, and I will be
transformed into a cripple. In other words…I, your father, can only
be a Zifu Disciple for one more time. After one last bout of glory, I
will become a cripple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder his father’s
swordplay was so powerful! No wonder his father never rode on a
ranked magic treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Immortal path is
shattered. I only have one opportunity to use this forbidden art
again.” Yichuan looked at his son. “Previously, I was keeping
this opportunity in abeyance for you. I wanted to protect you. I
wanted you to hold on to my jade sword, and upon encountering any
danger, you would shatter that jade sword, and I would immediately
hurry over to you. Even if you encountered a Zifu Disciple, I would
have the power to rescue you. For the sake of my son, it would have
been worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So the truth was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So the truth was, his
father had been planning on this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you no longer
need my protection.” Yichuan smiled. “Your mother is dead as
well. My Immortal path is shattered. And you are an adult, now. I
have nothing holding me back. I will not retreat, this time. This
will be the last battle I shall ever fight, and it will also be the
most glorious battle of my life. If I die, I would rather die in this
battle, die for the sake of the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at his
father, at his father’s smile. His father rarely smiled, but the
smile on his father’s face was a very relaxed one. Although Ning
felt bitter pain in his heart, he didn’t try to dissuade his
father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the six, five of the
elders were preparing to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…” Just as Ning
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire barked, “It’s
one thing for us to go risk our lives, but you, Ji Ning! You are the
hope of our Ji clan! Your talent is something which our clan has
never given birth to before! You must continue to live!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, I know
what you mean.” Ning shook his head. “But I am not willing to
hide and just watch as you risk your lives. I am not willing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ninefire
said, enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Patriarch, don’t
worry. I’m not a brash and mindless brute. If I see that the
situation is unsalvageable, I will immediately leave and save my own
life.” Ning looked at the Patriarch. “I have a Traceless
Talisman. I imagine, Patriarch, you know how powerful the Traceless
Talisman is. Once I activate it, I will instantly be able to travel
to a distance of up to ten thousand kilometers.” Ever since his
mother had died, his father had given the Traceless Talisman to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Traceless Talisman?
Of course he knew that the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had this
treasure. He had once desired it, but the Ji clan had its rules which
no one could violate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since that’s the
case.” Ninefire nodded. “Fine. You can come along with us. But if
the situation grows unsalvageable, you must immediately leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thus, right here,
within the desolate mountain forest filled with the fog of the
bewildering formation, the six members of the Ji clan made their
decision. Together, they would battle against Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are only six
of us.” Ninefire was actually filled with a boundless martial
spirit. “As for Snowdragon Mountain, after their Swallow Mountain
branch suffered such a loss, they will definitely invite some of
their fellow disciples from the surrounding branches to come. By
then, an entire group of Zifu Disciples will attack us en masse, and
perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept might come as well! Fighting them head
on is idiocy. What we need to do is to delay. Thus, we must set up
multiple layers of formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Formations.
Patriarch, you are the most skilled amongst us in formations.”
Truekeep was filled with anticipation as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will set up
multiple layers of large formations.” Ninefire looked towards the
other five. “Leave the formation setting to me. What the rest of
you need to do is come up with ideas to improve your own fighting
abilities, such as perhaps using some of the supreme guardian
treasures of your respective prefectures…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire lowered his
head, looking into the ground. “Beneath this desolate wilderness,
in an area with a circumference of thousands of kilometers, there
lies hidden an enormous elemental ore mine! But the strange thing is,
prior to this, nobody had ever discovered it. The vein is very close
to the surface, yet nobody discovered it. In addition, previously,
there had been such a powerful, forceful elemental energy wave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. It had been the
elemental energy ripple that had attracted their attention to this
place. It was very bizarre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps a strange,
incredible treasure has just entered the world.” Ninefire said.
“The elemental energy ripple that came prior to this could have
been created by the emergence of this unique treasure, which might
have caused the surrounding area to transform into an elemental ore
mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps an
Immortal was training here. When Immortals train, the amount of
elemental energy they consume is as vast as an ocean.” Ninefire
sighed. “If they train for a long period of time, an elemental ore
mine will naturally form.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow frowned.
“Elder Brother, are you saying…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
looked at Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am guessing.”
Ninefire’s eyes held a hint of desire. “That this elemental ore
mine must have a secret behind its origins. Perhaps it has some
treasures within, or some precious items left behind by an Immortal!
Even items casually discarded by an Immortal…are enough to allow
our Ji clan’s power to increase greatly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, are you
suggesting…?” Truekeep grew excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures?”
Yichuan and the others all stared towards the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire nodded. “Let’s
dig into the ground and do an investigation. Perhaps we might find
something.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of them felt that
the words of the Patriarch were reasonable. That elemental energy
ripple from earlier had indeed been bizarre, and it was also strange
that this elemental ore mine had never been discovered. Perhaps some
treasure was hidden within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
looked at Ning. “That protective lotus technique of yours seems to
dig very quickly. It’ll be up to you. We’ll follow from behind
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Fine.
I’ll begin, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumblerumblerumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning controlled his
Waterflame Lotus, making it swivel through the ground, constantly
digging deeper into it. Those elemental stones were easily broken
through, carving out a tunnel. Ning moved quickly and constantly,
digging deeper and deeper, while Ninefire and the rest of the five
were behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His speed is so
fast.” Truekeep sighed in amazement, following from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we started
digging, we were fast as well, but after exhausting a large amount of
our Ki, we had to begin to slow down. But Ji Ning is completely
relying on borrowing the power of nature.” Ninefire had already
been able to see through Ning’s Waterflame Lotus, and that it was
formed from natural power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to go
deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, wherever
the quality of the elemental ore is the finest, that is where you
should dig.” Ninefire said. “If there are any treasures present,
they should be located at wherever the elemental energy is the
strongest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had noticed as
well…that different areas had different quality elemental stones.
Some places only had low-grade elemental stones, while other places
had quite a bit of high-grade elemental stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumblerumblerumble…”
The Waterflame Lotus drilled down, like a giant dragon swimming
through the underground ore deposit, constantly boring in the
direction of high-grade stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After an hour…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The majority of
stones here are high-grade stones. You can pick them out with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a precious
location.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many high-grade
elemental stones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they knew all
along that this was a rich vein, they hadn’t imagined that this
elemental ore mine would actually have a location within it with such
an abundance of high-grade elemental stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Suddenly,
an explosive sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a sudden
halt, causing Ninefire and the other four behind Ning to come to a
startled halt as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Ninefire asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In front of me,
there is a very tough, unyielding stone. My Waterflame Lotus is
actually unable to drill through.” Ning said, puzzled. The power of
his Waterflame Lotus was now tremendous, and generally speaking, even
forged weapons would be shattered by it, to say nothing of rocks. “It
really is strange.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumblerumblerumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
quickly swept away the nearby stones, allowing Ning to get a good
luck at what was in front of him; a very flat, rocky surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
was puzzled. Ninefire, Yichuan, and the others were puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
control his Waterflame Lotus to scatter aside the surrounding
elemental stones…and soon, what appeared before their eyes was part
of an enormous stone room, with a door in front of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a stone
room! Manmade! Even Ji Ning’s Waterflame Lotus is unable to break
through it. This is no ordinary stone room; it must have been left
behind by an Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the Ji
clan all revealed looks of wild joy on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the ground,
more than a hundred kilometers down, in the heart of this elemental
ore mine, they had discovered a stone room. Who amongst them would
believe that it was a common room?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, don’t go
too close. Beware of restrictive spells.” Ninefire said. “Keep
away from it, and control your magic treasures to open the stone door
at a distance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them hurriedly
retreated, while Ning directly controlled a sword-type magic
treasure, sending it flying outwards and pushing at the stone door.
Rumble…the stone door slowly turned, revealing an entrance.
Instantly, an incomparably thick surge of elemental essence spurted
out from within that stone room, causing Ning and the rest of them to
feel incredibly comfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There must be
Immortal treasures within.” Ninefire called out frantically.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 25 - Establishing the Zifu
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dense elemental
aura caused Ning to take a deep breath. He could feel the Xiantian ki
in his dantian rumble as it continuously grew. “What pure, dense
elemental energy. The elemental energy released just by opening the
door to this stone room is already so dense…then what about inside
the room?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go in
rashly. There might be danger within.” Ji Ninefire hurriedly
warned. “I’ll release a bug to go investigate inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire opened his
mouth, and a black wasp immediately flew out, quickly flying through
the stone door and darting into the stone room. After a span of time
of ten breaths, the black wasp flew back out, and Ninefire swallowed
it once more into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of them looked at
Patriarch Ninefire, who just laughed. “I’ve finished my
investigation. There’s no danger at all within. Come, let’s go
take a look! You follow behind me. Even if there are dangers hidden
within the stone room that I could not detect, I will be the first to
die. Ji Ning, you walk in the very back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji Ning needs
to stay in the back.” Each of them looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing Ning
could do. He didn’t argue, instead just docilely following from
behind. Ninefire and Granny Shadow were in the very front, and as
soon as they entered, the sound of their delighted, amazed cries rang
out. “What a treasure! What a treasure!” “This place definitely
was a place where an Immortal trained. Definitely!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, had
an itchy feeling in his heart. What exactly was inside?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can all come in.
I’ve swept it with my Ki. There’s no danger.” Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, everyone
entered, and even Ning hurriedly followed them inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What thick elemental
energy.” This was the first thing Ning sensed when he entered; that
there was an incomparably dense, natural elemental energy in this
place, causing all of the pores of his body to swell open and welcome
it, absorbing as much of it as they could. The entire room seemed to
be filled with a visible, verdant aura off life energy. This was a
natural color which would appear once natural elemental energy
reached a certain density.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, shut the
stone door. Don’t let this elemental energy leak out. This stone
room is rather special. Once the door is shut, the elemental energy
won’t leak out.” Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
understood this as well. Prior to this, it was only when he had
pushed the stone door open that the elemental energy had leaked out.
Rumble…the stone door shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked curiously
in detail at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This room was thirty
meters in diameter. There was even a door nearby; there should be
other rooms within as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Ninefire
pointed at a large pool, which was filled with a layer of thin green
liquid. The green liquid was slowly swirling, filled with boundless
life energy. The reason why the air here was emanating that
incomparably dense elemental energy was because the liquid was
releasing it into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am absolutely
certain.” Ninefire said confidently. “That it definitely was an
Immortal in training who caused this elemental ore mine to be formed.
He intentionally set down a formation to summon a boundless amount of
natural elemental energy from the surrounding area. After many years
of accumulated energy, the elemental ore mine was formed. But to an
Immortal, what is necessary isn’t elemental stones, but rather,
this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire pointed at the
water pool filled with the layer of green liquid, incomparably
certain. “Liquefied elemental essence! This is the true essence of
natural elemental energy, extremely pure liquefied elemental
essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
held their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Liquefied elemental
essence?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one described the
elemental energy contained within high-grade elemental stones as
‘very pure’ and as being not very burdensome to the body, and
capable of increasing training speed tenfold, then liquefied
elemental essence…was the purest form of elemental essence, which
place no strain on the body whatsoever. One could completely absorb
and convert it within a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, some
Immortals, after being reincarnated, would lose their memories and
become ordinary mortals. Once they regained their memories, however,
based on the insights they had gained into the heavenly Dao, as well
as the power of their souls, they could for example obtain and make
use of a legendary ‘Nine Cycles Golden Pill’, which contained an
ocean’s worth of elemental energy, and which also placed no burden
on the body, allowing one to quickly absorb it all within a short
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once a reincarnated
Immortal regained his memory and swallowed a ‘Nine Cycles Golden
Pill’, then just by relying on the natural elemental energy
contained within the pill…he would be able to once again become an
Immortal within a single day!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To improve in one’s
training?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strengthen one’s
soul! One’s level of understanding! One’s techniques! Elemental
energy! Not a single one of these four could be lacking! As for
reincarnated Immortals, it was because they possessed the first three
already, which was why they could rely on a single ‘Nine Cycles
Golden Pill’ to instantly become an Immortal. If they didn’t have
the Nine Cycles Golden Pill, even reincarnated Immortals would have
to slowly, step by step train and rise in power. As for ordinary
mortals, if they swallowed a ‘Nine Cycles Golden Pill’, they
would be instantly exploded by the sea of elemental energy the pill
contained!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nine Cycles Golden
Pill…was the stuff of legends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had read about
liquefied elemental essence in books before. Liquefied elemental
essence, in sufficient quantities, could be comparable to a Nine
Cycles Golden Pill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal who
trained here…” Ninefire said excitedly. “He definitely had
accumulated a large amount of liquefied elemental essence here.
Because of his training, he had already used up the vast majority of
it, leaving behind only this thin layer. But even just this thin
layer…is perhaps comparable to the entire wealth of our Ji clan.
And in addition, even if our Ji clan had the wealth to buy something
like this, we still wouldn’t be able to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood
that liquefied elemental essence would allow a person to avoid
spending a long period of time in absorbing and refining energy!
Thus, it had long ago been monopolized by large sects and large
clans. They might gift it to some truly monstrous talents, or some
top-tier experts, making it so that they wouldn’t have to waste too
much time in slowly refining elemental energy. How could the Ji clan
possibly be able to buy something like this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, with
this, will you be able to break through to the Wanxiang Adept stage?”
Ning asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan’s
training methods are fairly poor.” Ninefire shook his head. “In
theory, I can break through, but in reality, our Ji clan, from past
to present, has never produced a single Wanxiang Adept! I’ve
trained for nearly four centuries now. If it were possible for me to
become a Wanxiang Adept, I would’ve broken through long ago. This
liquefied elemental essence is useless to me, or for your Granny
Shadow. But for you, Ji Ning, it has quite a bit of use!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji Ning, you
are the most suitable person for usig it.” Granny Shadow looked at
Ning as well, her eyes filled with expectation. “You are such a
genius. In truth, for you to have been born to our Ji clan has
resulted in the Ji clan holding you back. You have to waste so much
time in slowly accumulating elemental ki energy. If you were born
within some top-tier clans, you would train much more quickly than
you have thus far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, use it.”
Yichuan said as well. “Don’t be hesitant and shy. I know exactly
what level you are on. In terms of insight, most likely all of us are
at least a level bellow you. By relying on this liquefied elemental
essence, you absolutely can reach a higher level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Truekeep,
Ninefire, and the others all looked eagerly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a warm
feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Such a treasure…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, they were all
leaving it for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, I won’t
be shy then.” Ning said directly. “I’ll immediately take the
liquefied elemental essence and begin to train.” It would be hard
for him to break through as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and even if he
wanetd to try, he needed the power of the Sun and the Moon…and so,
this liquefied elemental essence was more suited for him in training
as a Ki Refiner. He had reached the necessary level of insight long
ago; he absolutely could establish his Zifu foundation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ninefire
and the others were filled with excitement and anticipation. To them,
this liquefied elemental essence would only be able to raise their
power by a limited amount. But to the most monstrously talented
member of the Ji clan, Ji Ning…it would most likely increase his
power tremendously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go look at
the other rooms and see if there’s anything else we can use.”
Ninefire said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was the other
room nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that room, there was
only a stone bed, a stone chair, and a stone table. Nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this place
was just the place where the Immortal shut himself in for training,
while this other room was the study where the Immortal would rest and
flip through Immortal manuals.” Ninefire said. “The other room is
a room where the Immortal actually trained.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing
else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No other treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and the others
took a careful look as well, but this stone room just had a primary
room and a side room. It was very simple and plain, and one could
tell at a glance that there was nothing else here. They used their ki
energy to sweep it as well, but couldn’t find any hiding places for
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ninefire and the others returned to the main room. They looked at
Ning, then instructed, “Ji Ning, you remain here and train.
Remember, shut the stone door. There’s a secret mechanism above the
door. Once you shut the door, no one outside will be able to open it.
We’ll wait aboveground for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the others
all quickly left, leaving only Ning behind in the stone room. Ning
pushed the door shut, locking it in place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training was something
very important. One had to be very careful. Otherwise, if one was
disturbed at an important point during the training, it would be very
dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time…I should
be able to establish my Zifu.” Ning looked at the pool, filled with
that spiritual liquefied elemental essence. He didn’t hesitate any
further, immediately sitting down next to the pool and immediately
activating his [Water Element Art] technique. The [Water Element
Art], although a very basic technique, was one in which establishing
the Zifu was simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after
establishing his Zifu, Ning needed to change to a different type of
Ki Refining technique. Otherwise, just by relying on this poor
technique, it would be quite difficult for him to become a Wanxiang
Adept. In theory, it was possible, but only in theory. As for
becoming a Primal Daoist? Even in theory, it was impossible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning wasn’t
impatient. He primarily trained as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, after
all. In the future, he would also leave Swallow Mountain. Naturally,
he would be able to acquire a higher level technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” Ning
activated the [Water Element Art], and immediately began to absorb
the elemental energy nearby. The elemental energy within this stone
room was simply too dense, and it constantly condensed into Ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Absorb!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, part of
the liquefied elemental essence within the pool flew up into the air.
Controlled by Ning’s divine will, the essence flew straight into
Ning’s mouth and entered his body. As soon as the liquefied
elemenetal essence entered his body…it instantly transformed into
elemental energy. The incomparably pure elemental energy constantly
circulated within his dantian, transforming directly into elemental
ki energy. It was successful at a single go! It didn’t place any
stress on his body at all. Ning could constantly, unceaselessly
continue to absorb and transform this energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
green water-type ki in his dantian began to surge about like endless,
vast waves, wildly swirling and constantly accumulating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” Ning once
more opened his mouth, drawing some liquefied elemental essence into
his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive wave of
energy arose within his dantian. His elemental ki energy, which
originally needed a long period of time to slowly accumulate, quickly
reached a limit. Boundless amounts of elemental energy swirled
ferociously in his dantian under great pressure, as though the space
in his dantian was too small, unable to contain so much elemental
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, something
happened, like when Pangu split open the primordial chaos and created
the heavens and the earth! The chaotic, monocolored dantian suddenly
exploded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around
Ning, who had been quietly seated in the lotus position by the side
of the pool, a large amount of watery mist suddenly arose out of
nowhere. In this moment, he could so very clearly sense the ‘Dao’,
but soon afterwards, the feeling disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I established my
Zifu! Now that my Zifu is established, I have my foundation for
continuing my training as an Immortal practitioner.” Ning said
softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his body, in the
location where the dantian had previously been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was now a vast,
empty, boundless space. This vast, empty space contained a limitless
amount of violet ki which filled it. This strange location,
quasi-real and quasi-imaginery, was the Violet Palace! Every single
person, upon establishing their Zifu Violet Palace, would have the
same thing. However, as to what sort of level a person would be able
to train to in the future, that depended on each person’s destiny
and techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb!” Ning
opened his mouth, and more liquefied elemental essence from the
watery pool into Ning’s body like water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, spread-out
space with violet ki instantly had the first drop of elemental ki
formed from it. Soon, a large amount of ki was constantly coalescing.
Within this boundless, empty, illusory void, a small pool began to
form, which quickly transformed into a small pond…elemental ki
continued to solidify and accumulate, and the size of the pond
continued to grow as well…

Chapter 26 - Stormclouds Approaching
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated next
to the pool of water in the lotus position. His aura was like that of
savage waves crashing down. He continued to open his mouth, absorbing
the liquefied soul essence within the pool, causing that layer of
liquefied essence to quickly deplete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly, Ning shut
his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A smile on his face,
Ning opened his eyes. He glanced at the green, liquefied soul essence
in the pool. “It let me break through as a peak Xiantian expert,
allowing me to establish my Zifu, then solidify my base as an early
Zifu Disciple. It has saved me at least a year or two of effort. I
used up a third of the liquefied essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a short period of
time, just long enough to boil a pot of tea, not only had he
established his Zifu, he had also solifidied his base. Even Ning, at
his astonishing rate of improvement, would have needed a year or two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If I use the remaining
two thirds of liquefied essence to train, I might be able to reach
the mid-stage as a Zifu Disciple.” Ning understood that since he
had already stabilized his base as an early Zifu Disciple, by relying
on the remaining liquefied essence, he absolutely had the possibility
of breaking through again, but if he really were to rely on the
[Water Element Art] to train to the mid-stage as a Zifu Disciple, his
future Ki Refining path would become difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the [Water
Element Art] was a very low-class technique. It was fine to use it to
establish a Zifu, because every person’s Zifu was the same. But if
Ning was to use it to break through to the middle of the Zifu level?
There would be a very negative effective on the purity of his
elemental energy. This single wrong step would be something which he
would be unable to undo in the future. In the future, it would become
ten times or a hundred times more difficult for him to become a
Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already made
a large leap forward and become a Zifu Disciple! Even if I break
through to become a mid-stage Zifu Disciple, the amount of benefit I
would see in terms of power would be limited.” Ning pondered to
himself. Leaping to a new level was a qualitative transformation! But
a small leap within the same level didn’t have that much of an
impact on his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiantian lifeforms
could dominate Houtiane experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zifu Disciples could
dominate Xiantian lifeforms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even an early Zifu
Disciple could still dominate most peak Xiantian lifeforms. This was
a qualitative difference. To battle someone at a higher level?
Difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if an early Zifu
Disciple were to battle a mid-stage Zifu Disciple…it would be hard
to say who the victor was. This sort of small gap within the same
level didn’t result in huge differences in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I use up the
remaining liquid, the amount of power I would gain would be limited,
and it would destroy my future path. Not worth it.” With a flip of
his hand, Ning made a talisman appear, which had a Fiendgod word on
it; ‘Right’. This was the control talisman for the Aquatic Manor.
Ning stared at it, an eager light flickering in his eyes. “Although
I’ve established my Zifu, and I am confident that if I were to meet
Dong Ziqi again, I would be able to suppress him and perhaps even
kill him…this time, I will have to face not just Dong Ziqi by
himself, but an entire group of Snowdragon Mountain experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope this Aquatic
Manor…will allow my power to rise to a new level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given that this
Aquatic Manor was able to produce the likes of Immortal Juhua, it
should be extraordinary.” Ning said eagerly. A drop of green
elemental ki passed from his hand into the talisman, quickly binding
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of
ancient-feeling power seemed to awaken, causing Ning to feel the
desire to worship it from the depths of his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow.”
Ningn stared at the talisman. “I really wonder who the first master
of the Aquatic Manor was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately arose,
while at the same time, with a flip of his hand, he produced a
palm-sized jade bottle. This was an unranked magic treasure. Although
it was the size of his palm, it was able to contain within it
thousands of kilograms of fine wine. Ning had quite a few
storage-type magic treasures like this one. For example, when Ning
had undergone the Fiendgod Bloodforging process in the Aquatic Manor,
he had used one such gourd to contain a thousand kilograms of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.” Ning
stared at the liquefied elemental essence in the pool. Summoning his
divine will, ripple, ripple…the liquefied essence rose into the
air, passing through the neck of the jade bottle. Every single drop
was put in, leaving not a single drop remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
Immortal left behind this stone room.” Ning, before leaving, took a
final glance around the room. “It has caused such a calamity to my
Ji clan, but it also allowed me to establish my Zifu in advance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood in his
heart that this wasn’t the fault of that Immortal; if he had to
blame someone, he could only blame the Ji clan for being too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He left the stone room.
Ning then used his Waterflame Lotus, which swiveled about him,
carving a path straight out from within this elemental ore mine. He
quickly charged upwards at a constant pace. Ning knew that it would
take some time for him to charge a hundred kilometers upwards, and so
two magic treasures appeared in his hands; one was a palm-sized
flying boat magic treasure, while the other was a pair of black
wing-type magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat had
belonged to Bei Zishan, while the black wings had belonged to Ju San.
They were both ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I’ve
reached the Zifu level! I am able to use these ranked magic
treasures.” Ning understood that when reaching a new level, one
benefit was a qualitative improvement to his personal strength, while
another benefit was that the type of magic treasures he could use had
also risen. These two benefits, combined, made it so that Zifu
Disciples could absolutely dominate Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A petal of the
Waterflame Lotus burst forth from the ground, with Ning behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” In the
distance were Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others. They had
long since dispersed and recollected the surrounding bewildering
formation, and the sight of the desolate mountain forests had
returned. Only, in parts of the forest, the traces of the earlier
battle could still be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch. Father.”
Ning hurriedly walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You came out quite
quickly. We just arrived on the surface not long ago.” Ninefire and
the other four walked over, laughing. “Truekeep just emerged
moments ago as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thought about it.
He had been in training for as much time as it takes to brew a pot of
tea; the amount of time he had spent boring through the ground had
actually been greater than that. The Patriarch and the others had
most likely had to spend more time boring through the ground than he
did…and so, doing the math, it seemed as though they probably
really did emerge at roughly the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Ji Ning.”
Ninefire asked. “Prior to this, when you killed Ju San. What magic
treasures did you acquire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few.” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Grany Shadow
explained in detail, “We need to do an accounting of these
treasures, to see who they are most useful for. This is the easiest
way to put them to good use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Jusan
had one flying transportation magic treasure, one storage magic
treasure, one protective magic treasure, one magic greataxe, and a
pair of magic wings! The magic wings are useful to me, but the others
are not.” Ning had already acquired a ranked storage magic
treasure, a transportation magic treasure, and a protective magic
treasure from Bei Zishan. Thus, only this pair of ranked wing-type
magic treasures was useful for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you need?”
Ninefire looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swords!” Ning
said. “I only need ranked flying swords. Other things are useless
to me. The more ranked flying swords, the better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His two sources of
combat power were close quarters combat and the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In particular, now that
he had established his Zifu, the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] had naturally grown only greater. However, if he continued
to use unranked swords…his power would most likely only rise by one
or two levels. If, however, he was able to completely exchange them
for ranked swords, Ning felt that he would probably be able to give
even a Wanxiang Adept a good fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ranked flying
swords? The more the better?” Ninefire, Granny Shadow, the old
servant Ah Xing, and Yichuan all repeated softly, then offered one or
two flying swords each.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All together, we
have five flying swords that we don’t need for now.” Ninefire
looked at Ning. “Is it enough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather
disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] required at least nine swords to be used together
in order to work and creation a formation base! And nine formations
bases were required for each [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
formation! In other words, the smallest unit, the ‘formation base’,
required at least nine ranked swords. And, to make his [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] truly transform in power, he needed at
least eighty one ranked flying swords. Only by using them as the
foundation would the power of the other, unranked swords become truly
explosive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
ideal solution would be to only use ranked flying swords…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to Ning’s
calculations, if he only used ranked flying swords, he would only be
able to use the third level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. But the power of it would be incomparably greater than
before! Quality was even more important than quantity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many do you
need?” Ninefire asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need seven ranked
flying swords. The more, the better. If I had several hundred, it
would be even better.” Ning laughed. Sword-type magic treasures
were very common; Ning had acquired a pair of ranked flying swords
from Bei Zishan alone. If they could come up with another seven, then
Ning would have nine in total, enough for a single, smallest unit
‘formation base’. With this formation base as the core, the power
of the entire [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would double or
triple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Several hundred?”
Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others were all shocked. However,
when they thought back to the scene of Ning utilizing the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], they realized that he did indeed have
seven hundred plus flying swords swirling around him. It seemed as
though Ning really did indeed need a large number of flying swords.
But several hundred ranked magic treasures? Even if the entire Ji
clan bankrupted itself, it wouldn’t be able to afford it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll strive to
help you come up with seven more swords.” Ninefire said, then
changed the subject. “Snowdragon Mountain will publicize this to
their comrades. Most likely, they will come for battle in a day or
two. Before this, you can all go back and pick up any treasures that
you need or take care of any matters that need addressing.
Afterwards, we will regroup here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and Ah Xing mounted an enormous wine gourd, quickly
disappearing into the horizon, leaving behind only Ning and his
father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
this was rather like taking care of one’s post-mortem affairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, will you
return to West Prefecture City?” Ning looked at his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. To Serpentwing
Lake.” Yichuan shook his head. “I want to visit Little White. The
two of us are like brothers who have shared life and death together.
No matter what, I have to see him again.” Yichuan had stayed for
five years at Serpentwing Lake, and the Whitewater Hound had stayed
with him this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White?” Ning
nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godbeast
‘Whitewater Hound’ had an extremely close relationship Ning’s
father. They had adventured together to as far as the Darknorth Sea.
The time they had spent together was even longer than the time Ning’s
father and mother had spent together. Indeed, they really were
lifelong brothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” A
flying boat appeared beneath Ning’s feet, and Yichuan mounted it as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat
instantly rose into the air, quickly passing through the skies and
into the clouds…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain had a
total of ten commandery cities. Snowdragon Mountain had three of
them, which were similar to the commandery city the Ji clan
controlled, the ‘City of Ten Thousand Swords’. As soon as Dong
Ziqi had invaded Swallow Mountain, he had given the name of the city
he had taken over the name of ‘Snowdragon City’, so as to let
everyone know that this was a branch of Snowdragon Mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although afterwards,
they had taken over two more commandery cities, the heart of this
branch of Snowdragon Mountain remained in Snowdragon City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are they?
Where are the others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above
Snowdragon Mountain, three figures stood there atop a flying screen,
staring into the distance as a greef leaf hurtled through the air,
with Dong Ziqi and Muse standing atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are the other
three? All dead?” These three figures asked frantically. The three
of them were the three other Zifu Disciples of the Swallow Mountain
branch of Snowdragon Mountain. They were of the ‘Ju’ clan and the
‘Dong’ clan. Earlier, the Zifu Disciple belonging to the Ju clan,
Ju Nianxiong, had seen that his nephew’s life-talisman had
shattered, and so he had hurried over to Snowdragon Mountain. The two
elders of the Dong clan were terrified upon hearing this, knowing
that something must have gone wrong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they didn’t
expect that not only had Ju San died, even the He siblings had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They died. My three
fellow disciples all died.” Dong Ziqi gritted his teeth. “It was
the Ji clan. They set up a formation early on, then suddenly
attacked, causing us to be caught offguard. My three fellow disciples
were ganged upon and killed one by one. With the He siblings dead,
most likely that official writ was taken away as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three commandery
cities. They were split up between the Dong clan, the He clan, and
the Ju clan. One of the official writs had been carried by the He
siblings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan is
asking for death!” Ju Nianxiong’s eyes were bloodshot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Muse said in
a cold voice, “This time, due to the elemental ripples, we went to
go investigate. We discovered that there was an enormous elemental
ore mine within the Ji clan’s territory, with a large number of
high-grade elemental stones. The entire quarry has a circumference of
four thousand kilometers and a depth of three hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nianxiong and the two
elders of the Dong clan were badly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan wasn’t
willing to hand it over, so we ended up in a battle.” Ziqi forced
the words out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shorter of the two
elders of the Dong clan howled in a furious voice, “The main sect
desperately needs an enormous elemental ore mine such as this! If we
offer it to the main sect…this will be a great merit for us. The Ji
clan actually dares to oppose Snowdragon Mountain? Then we’ll
destroy the Ji clan, we’ll annihilate them all!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we’ll
annihilate their clan!” Ziqi’s eyes flashed with a cold light.
“But what I fear the most is that the Ji clan will sign a transfer
agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Dong elders and
Ju Nianxiong both paused. If a transfer agreement truly was signed,
then even Snowdragon Mountain wouldn’t dare to interfere. Challenge
the Grand Xia Dynasty? Did they want to die?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the Ji clan
needs to first make the report, then await the arrival of the
Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty. It will take at least three
days. If we can do our best to delay, we can delay for a period of
time.” Ziqi said hurriedly. “So we have to hurry. We have to
invite our comrades and have them arrive at Swallow Mountain as fast
as possible, so that we can annihilate the Ji clan together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Everyone
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan had killed
three of their Zifu Disciples, leaving them only five. If they went
and fought all out, even if the won, most likely most of them would
die. No matter how great the merit they rendered would be, they had
to be alive to win plaudits for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of you, go
invite the various Snowdragon Mountain branches nearest to us.”
Ziqi said. “I myself will head to Swallow Mountain City to meet
with the garrison general, and ask him to delay as long as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The four
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invite a few dozen
comrades. By then, with dozens of us together…we will utterly crush
and annihilate the Ji clan with ease.” Ziqi said. “There’s
virtually no danger when we join together into a group, and everyone
will have a share of the glory. Those comrades will definitely come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll go make
a trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the arrangements
and travel plans were made. The other four Zifu Disciples headed
separately in four different directions to invite their fellow
sectmates, while Dong Ziqi headed to Swallow Mountain City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast Serpentwing
Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying boat descended
at high speed from the skies, landing at one corner of Brightheart
Island. This was the place where Ning’s father lived. The only
thing here was a quite, secluded residence. There weren’t even any
servants present, just a large, snow-white dog which lay there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
suddenly raised his head as the flying boat descended at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
looked at the Whitewater Hound, feeling a surge of emotion as well.
First, Ning knew that this Uncle White and his father were brothers
that had fought together and risked their lives together, and that
Ning’s mother and Ning himself had both been saved by Uncle White.
And second, that year when gone outside of West Prefecture City every
day to train archery, it had been Uncle White who had stood guard the
entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He watched as his
father and Uncle White moved towards each other. Although Uncle White
was incapable of speech, the master-servant bond allowed spiritual
communication at a close distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quietly left as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very shortly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to his
own residence, entering the quiet room which he used for training. He
immediately sealed the room off. Earlier, while flying over
Serpentwing Lake, Ning had already sensed the Aquatic Manor! It was
just as the old black bull had said; once he bound the control
talisman, he would be able to sense and directly enter the Aquatic
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During this battle,
I saw that although my power was great, it was still far from being
sufficient. I hope that this ancient Aquatic Manor will be useful and
be able to improve my power greatly.” Ning was filled with hope and
expectations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in.”
Ning willed it, and instantly, an enormous illusion of a grizzly head
appeared in the quiet room. The enormous grizzly head opened its
illusory maw, swallowing Ning with one gulp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disappeared from
within the quiet room.
