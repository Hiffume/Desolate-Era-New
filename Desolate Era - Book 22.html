Chapter 1 - Becoming a True God
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning opened his eyes
and looked at the beautiful bloodlotus flowers hovering in the air
around him. Although their baleful aura filled the entire region, the
aura was unable to disguise their beauty. Ning almost felt as though
he could see a dazzlingly beautiful woman surrounded by that sea of
blood. The woman’s face was the face of the woman he wished to see
the most. She silently stood there, amidst the bloodlotus flowers,
smiling at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently murmured
these words to himself. He was silent for a moment, then waved his
hand and took back the bloodlotus flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, Ning sat down in
the lotus position and began to train in the [Solitary World God].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartrate began to
slow down; in fact, it very nearly stopped. His blood flow began to
stop as well. Ning just sat there, seeming to have become a solitary,
withered tree. However, his senses were more acute than ever before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine body…”
Ning traced the sensations of starvation back to its source, finding
the sense of hunger that permeated his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There we go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
initiated the technique for making the breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the Dao of the
Sword serve as the core.” Instantly, the divine power that
permeated every single cell in Ning’s body began to change,
transforming into countless tiny swords. Every single drip of divine
power was in the shape of a sword, making it as though Ning’s
entire body was composed of countless tiny swords. Every single tiny
sword embodied the essence of a Grand Dao, the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When breaking through
to become a True God, an Elder God, or a World God, there was one
thing in common that was needed: A specific Dao had to be used as the
core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two identical sets of
rocks. If one’s construction techniques were poor, they would
result in a flimsy, easily destroyed building. But if one’s
construction techniques were good, they would result in a building
that would last for thousands of year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The principle was the
same. If one wished to build a powerful divine body, one needed to
use absolutely brilliant techniques. The trick here lay in the Dao
that was used for the core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take Ning, for example;
as an Empyrean God, his divine body had reached the level of
perfection long ago. He wasn’t able to make any further
improvements whatsoever. However, to step into the higher realm of
True Gods, he first had to have sufficiently pure divine power. His
divine power had to more than a hundred times more pure than that of
an ordinary Empyrean God, which meant that he would have to change
even the core Dao which was the source of his divine power. When Ning
had become an Empyrean God, his core Dao had been the Dao of
Rainwater. Now, for the sake of breaking through to become a True
God, Ning chose to use the Dao of the Sword as his core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In in the Three Realms,
it was believed that there actually weren’t any ‘taboo’ Daos
that could not be used as the core. Upon mastering a specific
Heavenly Dao, one would generally use that Heavenly Dao as the core
for becoming a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The techniques passed
down by World God Northrest included many details notes within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each breakthrough
to a new realm, the divine body would be remade anew and perfected.
The core Daos used each time should not be contradictory ones! For
example, if he had become an Empyrean God through using the Dao of
the Inferno as his core, then when he became a True God he shouldn’t
use the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop. If he did, the two Daos would
interfere with each other. He would still be able to become a True
God, but he would never have any chance of becoming an Elder God
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
becoming a True God through cultivation was considered the apex of
power; they naturally wouldn’t care about such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, some of the
high-level cultivators within the endless primordial chaos had set
their sights on greater heights. They learned from the wisdom of
their elders, and so also set down rules of their own to ensure their
successors would know which choices were taboo. For example, the Daos
that you chose for making your breakthrough absolutely could not be
Daos that repelled each other! Once that happened, the divine body
would have an unstable foundation and it wouldn’t be able to
advance much further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The element of water
and the Dao of the Sword, however…one was an elemental Dao, while
the other was an attacking Dao; there were no contradictions at all.
Thus, there wouldn’t be any issues caused by choosing the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If both Daos were
elemental Daos, such as the Daos of Fire, Water, Metal, Earth, and
Wood, there would be contradictions. The only question would be how
serious the contradictions were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If both Daos were
attacking Daos, such as the Daos of the Sword, the Saber, etc., there
would also be contradictions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the contradictions
were minor, one would still eventually be able to become an Elder
God, but becoming a World God would be much more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the contradictions
were major, with the Daos being opposite-aligned, then even becoming
an Elder God would be extremely difficult. As for becoming a World
God, there would be no hope of that at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the primordial
chaos, this was considered to be secret information. Only people with
exalted statuses would be in possession of this knowledge. World God
Northrest, for example, knew these things because Vastheaven Palace
had an excellent repository of legacies. Ordinary cultivators weren’t
in possession of this information. Ning wished to tell his master and
the others, but when World God Northrest had transmitted these
legacies to Ning, Ning had long ago been forced to swear a lifeblood
oath that unless he became a World God, he was not permitted to teach
anyone the things which World God Northrest had taught him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning activated the
technique for making a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, his divine
body gave birth to an incredibly powerful sucking effect that filled
the prisonworld. The prisonworld had an enormous formation that was
meant to distill the primordial chaos within it into chaos nectar,
but as Ning made his breakthrough, his body began to ravenously draw
energy from the primordial chaos. This caused the formerly calm
primordial chaos within the prisonworld to suddenly become turbulent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more chaos
energy was drawn into Ning’s body and converted into divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword
served as his core, and it transformed the chaos energy into divine
power that was far purer than the divine power he had as an Empyrean
God. It was the divine power of a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As more and more divine
power built up inside Ning’s body, it slowly began to evolve and
transform. Every single bit of divine power in his body was
transforming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t I draw
any more divine power? The prisonworld’s formation is constantly
leeching energy from the primordial chaos, taking away more than 90%
of it, but we should still be able to draw power from the remaining
amount. But now, I can’t draw any power from it at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened to the
primordial chaos? Why did it become so frenzied and turbulent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals imprisoned within the prisonworld, alongside
exceptional True Gods and True Immortals who were able to tap the
power of primordial chaos such as True God Shiyu, all became puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod Body
Refiner has made a breakthrough. By the looks of it, it is at least a
breakthrough to the True God level. In fact, it could very well be a
breakthrough to the Elder God level.” Upon sensing how frenzied the
primordial chaos had become, the prisoners quickly understood what
was happening. However, they were quite puzzled. Generally speaking,
those with enough potential to make a breakthrough would’ve done so
long ago in the outside world. There was no way to even sense the
Daos in this world. In the past three chaos cycles, not a single
prisoner had made a large breakthrough like this. Who had just broken
through?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some prisoners quickly
thought of the newly arrived Overseer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Could it be the
Overseer?” True God Shiyu, who had replanted his flower garden
within the gorge, couldn’t help but frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod Body
Refining techniques of the Three Realms generally drew on the power
of outside stars. The [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
for example, drew from the energy of the Solar Star and the Lunar
Star. The other techniques would draw from the Seven Big Dipper Stars
or from other star systems and constellations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where did the energy of
stars come from?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
gave birth to many stars. The energy given off by stars, ‘stellar
energy’, was essentially the energy of primordial chaos that had
already been converted. This sort of pre-converted energy was
naturally easier to absorb. The [Solitary World God], however, was
even more profound; when breaking through, one could draw energy
straight from the primordial chaos itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, only in the
exact moment of the breakthrough would this be possible. It was much
like how the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] allowed for
the energy of Lunar Truewater and Solar Truefire to descend upon its
practitioners in the moment of breakthrough. During normal
cultivation, however, one needed to slowly, steadily draw upon
stellar energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Solitary World
God] was able to absorb all types of stellar energy. It could even
absorb energy from the frozen star on which Ning was currently
located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had some
insights into the Dao of Primordial Chaos, then even during normal
cultivation he would be able to draw energy from the primordial
chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grassy area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position, surrounded by an crater. It was as though he was an
enormous meteor that had smashed on the ground and created a crater,
but in reality it had been created by the enormous flow of chaos
energy that had surged here earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve changed.”
Ning could sense how powerful his body had become. Previously, he was
a mere Empyrean God, but thanks to the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] and
the [One True Body] technique he was equivalent to a half-step True
God! Now that he had broken through to become an actual True God, he
could be considered half a step into the Elder God realm of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In all the Three
Realms…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The likes of Daoist
Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha…the likes of Suiren,
Shennong, and Fuxi…and even the likes of Daomother Devilhand and
Keeper Everwood of the Seamless Gate…they are nothing more than
True Gods,” Ning murmured to himself. “I am a True God as well,
and I can be considered a half-step Elder God. Finally…I finally
have the power I need to change the course of the entire war for the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
three Realms were primarily composed of Daofathers and True Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Purities,
Tathagata, Suiren, Shennong, Fuxi, Subhuti, Houyi, Daomother
Devilhand, Keeper Everwood…all of them were True Gods! True Gods
and Daofathers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they
were able to unleash the overlord level of power and be comparable to
Elder Gods in might was primarily because their insights into the Dao
were far, far too profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata, for example,
had thoroughly mastered all five of the Heavenly Daos of Metal, Wood,
Water, Fire, Earth. These five Heavenly Daos formed a complementary
set known as the Five Elements, joining together to unleash a truly
dominating level of force. His insights into the Dao of Primordial
Chaos had also reached an inconceivable level! By relying on his
insights into the Daos, he was able to unleash a level of power that
was comparable to that of Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
the likes of Fuxi, Shennong, and Suiren; they all had exceedingly
high levels of insights into the Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mastery of the Heavenly
Daos of Yin and Yang, mastery of the Heavenly Daos of the Five
Elements…all of them had extremely profound levels of insight into
the Dao, which was why they were comparable to Elder Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofathers could be
divided into three levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Daofathers
were quite ordinary indeed; they would usually have mastery over one
or two of the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Top-tier Daofathers
generally held mastery over fifth-stage taiji-force, infiniforce,
swordforce, or other types of force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Overlord-class
Daofathers were equivalent to Elder Gods! Firegod Zhurong, Watergod
Gonggong, the Ancestor Dragon, the Phoenix, and the other Elder Gods
were born with mastery over one Heavenly Dao, and their insights into
the Daos were significantly inferior to that of Tathagata and Three
Purities. However, thanks to the great power of their divine bodies,
they still were overlord-class powers. Alas, some died in the wars
for supremacy during the Primordial Era, while others died in the war
that ended the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa had eventually
left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi had chosen to
reincarnate. He had become a human, but to this very day he had yet
to awaken his memories from his past life. He was just a True God and
a Daofather, not an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A number of the Elder
Gods of the Seamless Gate had also died in battle, with the Lord of
the Demonheart having fused himself into the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Three
Realms…the only true Elder God was the Lord of All Fiends. Him and
him alone! The second could be considered Ji Ning…a half-step Elder
God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My insights into the
Dao, compared to the other overlords, are rather lacking. However, my
path is the path of swordforce. By relying on my fifth-stage
swordforce and my sword-arts which surpass the limits of the Heavenly
Daos, as well as my half-step Elder God divine body, I should have
the power of an overlord Daofather.” Ning had battled against
Daomother Devilhand, and so he knew exactly where he ranked in terms
of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate.
Godking!” Ning’s eyes were filled with a strong, murderous
intent. Now that he had become more powerful, his murderous intent
had only strengthened even further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world…shall
change as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured these
words softly to himself, his voice filled with a thick desire to
kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he had to
wait. Had to endure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was only because
back then, he wasn’t strong enough yet. But now…he was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t rush
things. First, I’ll repair the surface layer of Violetjewel. By
then, I’ll be even more powerful.” Ning waved his hand, putting
away the stone sword-steles and the jade shrine. He then transformed
into a black lightning serpent, disappearing into the horizons with a
flash as he flew towards the location of the Five Elements Cauldron.

Chapter 2 - Divine Sword, Violetjewel
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning descended from
the skies, landing next to the Five Elements Cauldron. He turned to
look at the ancient stone platform next to it, as well as the the
blood-colored sword placed atop it. The sword’s body was still
filled with cracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel…”
Ning stared at the sword for a moment, then waved his hand. Whoosh! A
large amount of treasures came flying out of nowhere, every single
one emanating astonishingly powerful auras. The treasures almost
instantly formed a small mountain in size. These were virtually all
of the Protocosmic spirit-treasures Ning had acquired from the
hundred-plus True Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And after sweeping
through so many True Gods and True Immortals, Ning had also acquired
a Chaos treasure. The Chaos treasure was a great warhammer that
sparked with countless flickers of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Protocosmic
spirit-treasures…well, no point to having too many of them.” Ning
pointed to the distant Five Elements Cauldron. “Activate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Elements
Cauldron instantly began to emanate an aura of power and might as its
handles radiated with five blinding colors of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” Ning
released a thin sliver of sword-attribute divine power that
immediately swept all those Protocosmic spirit-treasures up. The
sabers, swords, axes, beads…the various Protocosmic
spirit-treasures continuously flew into the mouth of the Five
Elements Cauldron, which furiously ground them apart and extracted
the Five Elements essence from within them. In just ten seconds, Ning
had thrown nearly thirty Protocosmic spirit-treasures into the
cauldron, transforming them into tiny bits of debris. The amount of
Five Elements essence inside the cauldron’s storage region had
increased by quite a bit as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Protocosmic
spirit-treasures flew in, batch by batch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any major power of the
Three Realms would’ve been terrified by this sight. Ning himself
felt pain in his heart as well, but for the sake of repairing
Violetjewel…it would all be worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…hiss…pop…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sounds of treasures
being broken down rang out continuously from within the Five Elements
Cauldron. The mountain-sized pile of treasures that had been next to
it was shrinking rapidly, at a pace that could be detected with the
naked eye. Soon, almost all of the treasures were completely used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So much essence?”
Ning looked at the Five Elements Cauldron. The storage region within
it now contained an enormous amount of Five Elements essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of
debris and rubble flew out from within the mouth of the cauldron. As
it flew out, it was merely the size of a sphere that was roughly a
few meters in radius, but once it completely exited the cauldron it
quickly expanded to become a massive mountain of debris that was
thirty thousand meters high. Ning ‘pincered’ the rubbish with his
divine power, then gave them a casual toss. Swoosh! The massive pile
of debris flew hundreds of kilometers away, and where it landed a
giant mountain was born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see if it
works, this time. Based on my previous experiences…this amount of
essence should be enough.” Ning turned to look at the blood-colored
sword atop the stone dais. Swoosh! The sword instantly flew into the
air and came to hover in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emerge.” Ning
pointed at the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five streams of colored
energy surged out from the Five Elements Cauldron; the gold of Metal,
the blue of Water, the green of Wood, the crimson of Fire, and the
black of Earth. They swirled around the blood-colored sword in
circles, and Violetjewel instantly began to shudder. It was like a
starving beggar who had suddenly encountered a scrumptious feast. It
instantly began to furiously devour the ‘food’ surrounding it.
The five streams of energy completely surrounded it, but one could
still vaguely see that the surface of the blood-colored sword was
slowly beginning to heal. Some cracks were visibly growing smaller
and smaller before disappearing entirely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more of the
energy streams flowed out of the cauldron and into Violetjewel. The
speed at which the sword was being repaired at was noticeably much
faster now than when Ning had been using Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It spend more than two
hours swallowing the energy of the Five Elements essence before the
cauldron finally ran empty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning stared
at the beautiful blood-colored sword hovering in the air, a slight
frown on his face. The sword was breathtakingly, terrifyingly
beautiful, but two tiny cracks could still be seen on the body of
this beautiful sword. These two were the two final cracks that
remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually isn’t
repaired yet.” Ning frowned. “What should I do? I’ve used up
almost all the Pure Yang treasures and Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
I only have a single Chaos treasure that I don’t need, but there’s
a limit to how strong this cauldron is. It wouldn’t necessarily be
able to destroy a Chaos treasure,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Elements
Cauldron was just a Protocosmic spirit-treasure. It would be
extremely difficult for the cauldron to destroy a Chaos treasure and
extract essence from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.” Ning
suddenly thought of another treasure. With but a thought, he
instantly caused an ape-shaped golem to appear in the air. It was the
Envoy of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The critical
components to this Envoy are all destroyed. There’s no point
keeping it around. The Seamless Gate paid an enormous price to create
each of these Envoys; when a Daofather is in command of them, they
are all capable of unleashing power close to that of an
overlord-class figure. This treasure is far more useful than a Chaos
treasure, and it is made from more valuable materials as well.”
Ning secretly nodded to himself. “It has to have a great deal of
Five Elements essence within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Envoy was
powerful, the physical makeup of the Envoy itself was merely
comparable to top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures. For such an
enormous, powerful golem to reach the Chaos treasure level in its
entirety was far too difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Not
hesitating at all, Ning threw the Envoy into the Five Elements
Cauldron as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Envoy instantly
began to be ground apart. It was extremely hard to forcibly break
apart a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure, but the Five Elements
Cauldron was able to accomplish it easily. It operated on the basis
of principles that were completely antithetical to the existence of
treasures such as the Envoy! After a long while, the entire Envoy had
been completely harvested. Nothing was left but some debris, with a
large amount of Five Elements essence having been extracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single Envoy
contains far more essence than a hundred Protocosmic
spirit-treasures. No wonder the Seamless Gate, despite all of its
vast resources, was only able to produce a few of them.” Ning’s
eyes lit up. He immediately guided the extracted Five Elements
essence outwards, sending those five streaks of energy to once more
swirl around Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel began to
emit a ringing soon as it quickly absorbed the Five Elements essence.
Ning carefully stared at those two small cracks, watching as they
quickly shrank in size and depth, then completely disappeared. Next,
some of the shattered rune-lines on the inside of Violetjewel began
to be repaired as well. However, repairing the internal structure of
Violetjewel was far more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
all of the Five Elements essence was used up. The amount of internal
damage that had been repaired, however, was almost negligible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God
Northrest’s words were correct.” Ning sighed softly. “Repairing
the surface layer is easy, but repairing the internal damage…it’ll
be thousands of times more difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, the
most critical and precious part of the sword, its core, remains
perfectly intact. Even though my sacrifice of the Envoy and all those
treasures only allowed me to repair the surface layer, the sword can
still once more unleash some of its true power.” Ning stretched his
hand out and the blood-colored sword fell into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
blood-colored sword entered Ning’s hands, he could sense the
inconceivable power held within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, because the
internal structure of the sword was badly damaged, only a portion of
its full power could be unleashed at present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently swung the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The space in front of
him split apart, creating a tear in space that stretched out to ten
thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although only part
of its power is usable, it’s still terrifyingly strong. Thanks to
this sword, in all the Three Realms my offensive attack power is most
likely number one. Only Keeper Everwood, Lord Tathagata the Buddha,
and a few others who are extremely skilled in defense would be able
to withstand a head-on blow from me,” Ning murmured softly to
himself. The existence of this sword made a huge difference to him in
terms of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without this sword,
Ning was still an overlord-class figure, comparable to an Elder
God…but with it, he stood at the very peak of power, even amongst
overlords! As for exactly who was stronger and who was weaker, that
was a question that could only be settled through actual combat. It
had been a long time since the war that had ended the Primordial Era,
after all; no one knew exactly how much stronger the major powers on
each side had become. Perhaps there were other figures who were
hiding their true power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Buddha
Jueming of the Buddhist Sangha. He had also trained in the [Solitary
World God], and also had the [Nine Elements Destruction]. Ning
believed that after so many years of training in it, Buddha Jueming
had to have become an extraordinary figure as well. However, Buddha
Jueming remained very low-key in the Three Realms, which was why most
major powers viewed him as being just an ordinary True God or
Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is important to
be cautious at a time like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s best if I
avoid using Violetjewel, but if I’m forced to use it, I’ll need
to ensure that it has a tremendous effect.” Ning knew very well
that unleashing his trump card in a sudden, explosive manner would
make it extraordinarily effective. If Violetjewel was to make an
appearance, he wanted to make sure that the major powers of the
Seamless Gate would lose their lives as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
willed it, and the blood-colored sword immediately flew into his
body, resting itself within the Jindan region inside of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, it’s time to
go deal with True God Shiyu.” Ning wanted to acquire the
Heavengazer Tower very badly. The thing he needed the most right now
was time. If he was able to master a Heavenly Dao, he would have a
chance of becoming an Ancestral Immortal or Elder God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. A Darknorth
sword appeared in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
six Darknorth swords. During his recent battles, he had encountered
some True Gods and True Immortals who would rather die than bend the
knee to him. Ning had shown them no mercy at all and slain them,
allowing all six of his Darknorth swords to be upgraded to the Chaos
treasure level. However, according to how World God Northrest ranked
things, Ning’s six Darknorth swords could only be considered
standard-grade Chaos treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos treasures,
according to the records which World God Northrest had given Ning,
could be divided into standard-grade, high-grade, and top-grade
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against True God
Shiyu, the Darknorth swords will be enough.” Darknorth sword in
hand, Ning transformed into a black lightning serpent that
disappeared into the horizons.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain
gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver-haired man was
standing amidst a garden of flowers. He gently plucked a flower,
lowering his head to smell its fragrance. His face, however, remained
a bit gloomy and downcast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Overseer…” The
silver-haired man murmured these words to himself. “Is it him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earlier turbulence
in the primordial chaos…True God Shiyu had also come to the
conclusion that it had most likely been someone breaking through to
become a True God or perhaps Elder God! The prisoners, however, had
been trapped in the prisonworld for far too long; if they had any
breakthroughs to make, they would’ve made them long ago. The
chances for one of the prisoners to make a breakthrough was far, far
too low. Thus, the most likely answer was that it was the alien
Overseer who had been lucky enough to stumble across the prisonworld
who had made the breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That alien is
extraordinarily powerful. If he really did make a breakthrough…things
will be rather troublesome.” The silver-haired man’s face was
troubled. “He’s the Overseer, after all; he surely has many
treasures on him. Although my defensive skills are formidable, I
won’t be able to outlast him in a battle of stamina.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His only option was to
slowly draw energy from the primordial chaos inside the prisonworld.
The prisonworld had an enormous formation in it that was monopolizing
the vast majority of the primordial chaos, distilling it into chaos
nectar. Thus, the amount which he could make use of was quite
miniscule. The Overseer, however, was able to replenish his strength
from the outside world. This alone guaranteed that he wouldn’t be
able to match the Overseer in a battle of stamina.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” True God
Shiyu suddenly turned his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black lightning
serpent had appeared in the distance. With a flash, it appeared in
the air above the gorge. It was that white-robed youth, and he was
wielding a black sword in his hand. The white-robed youth descended
from the skies, landing on the ground. His aura was extremely
ordinary, almost like that of a mortal’s, but True God Shiyu’s
face turned solemn as he looked at the youth. True God Shiyu then let
out a cold laugh. “It hasn’t been that long since our last fight,
but you’ve come again. It seems that it really was you who made the
breakthrough just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was.” Ning
walked towards him, Darknorth sword in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if you did?
Last time, I was able to easily defend against you without using any
divine abilities at all. Even if an Elder God or Ancestral Immortal
came, I’d still be able to hold out, much less against you.” True
God Shiyu stared coldly at Ning. He remained quite prideful. Back
when he had lived in the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea, he had been able
to survive multiple fights against Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
and escape unscathed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You being
strong…that’s what makes it fun.” Ning smiled as he stepped
forward, a single sword in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu
manifested a cudgel in each of his two hands, staring solemnly at
Ning as he approached. Suddenly, Ning transformed into a streak of
light, his aura increasing by an explosive amount. When he struck out
with his sword, it was as though he was Pangu cleaving apart Heaven
and Earth. His massive black sword seemed to cause the world itself
to begin to crumble as it went smashing towards True God Shiyu with
irresistible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” True God
Shiyu’s twin cudgels spun in two distinct lines, coming together to
vaguely form a gigantic Taiji diagram which he used to defend against
that terrifying sword-blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword was like
Pangu’s axe, chopping down against the two crossed cudgels. True
God Shiyu was immediately smashed flying backwards, and even the
ground beneath his feet was shattered. A massive gouge appeared in
the ground, and the nearby flowers were all instantly crushed into
dust by the shockwave. Even the distant mountains began to tremble
and crack apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-art has
improved, compared to last time.” True God Shiyu stood within that
massive crater, looking back at Ning. “It’s only been a short
while, but not only has your divine body become far more powerful,
even your sword-arts have improved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t know
was that Ning had spent six hundred years training in Undermoon Lake,
engaged in multiple life-and-death battles in the outside world, then
even more battles in the prisonworld. These battles had been like a
whetstone that had continuously served to polish and sharpen Ji
Ning’s skills. It was only natural that his sword-arts continued to
improve at a dramatic rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And your cudgel-arts
remain as mysterious and profound as ever.” Ning stood in front of
him, still wielding just a single sword. With a flicker, he charged
towards True God Shiyu once more, causing a dazzling crescent moon of
sword-light to suddenly flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with this
beautiful crescent of sword-light, True God Shiyu’s face turned
even more solemn. Twin cudgels in his hands, he hurriedly strove to
block against this dazzling strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the
sword-strike was dodged. True God Shiyu, however, didn’t dare to
relax in the slightest, because Ning’s next sword-strike was now
arriving. Sword-light flashed again, and it was as though the
dazzling sun in the skies had suddenly been covered by dark
stormclouds, casting the world in shadow. True God Shiyu felt as
though this terrifying strike had cast him into a nightmarish world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single attack
Ning now used was the ‘Shadowless’ stance of the [Brightmoon]
sword-art. It had always been unpredictable and fast, but now that it
was being unleashed by someone who was a half-step Elder God, it
became even faster and even more astonishingly powerful. It was
already a sword-art that surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos.
Thus now, although it was just slightly faster than before, it
instantly became much more difficult to block than it had been in the
past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hate this type of
sword-art the most.” True God Shiyu hurriedly blocked three
sword-strikes before he was forced to use a divine ability to
manifest four more arms. Each of his six arms now held a cudgel as he
hurriedly strove to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
merely use a single sword. This single sword, however, was incredibly
taxing for True God Shiyu to defend against! “Where the hell did he
learn a sword-art like this that surpasses the Heavenly Daos?” True
God Shiyu ground his teeth. “He has such a powerful body, and his
sword-arts are absolutely marvelous. How the hell did he luck out
into learning something that surpasses the Heavenly Daos?!” If this
sword-art hadn’t surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos, it
would have been much easier for True God Shiyu to defend against
them. Instead, True God Shiyu now found it hard to defend against
Ning’s single sword, even when he was using six cudgels to fight
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless
stance…it was ephemeral and unpredictable, and it moved faster than
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw,
overwhelming power, the most formidable strike was the
‘Heavenbreaker’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of an
assassin’s strike that focused on instant, sudden speed, the most
formidable strike was the ‘Blood Drop’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
continuously fluctuated between forms, with his Shadowless stance
continuing to shock and unnerve True God Shiyu, putting him in a bad
position. His sword-art were simply far too unpredictable and
strange. The ‘Heavenbreaker’ stance relied on raw power, and each
time Ning used it he was able to send True God Shiyu flying away. The
Blood Drop stance was an assassin’s strike that was the most
penetrative attack of all; each time Ning unleashed it, True God
Shiyu could feel his entire body turning cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, it had been
fairly easy for him to defend against the Blood Drop stance, since it
was a straightforward attack with few transformations to it; it
focused mostly on speed. Now, however, Ning’s speed had become so
incredibly fast that even though it was straightforward, it was still
so hard to block as to cause True God Shiyu’s heart to tremble. If
it was just a hair faster, he probably wouldn’t be able to block at
all; the sword would go straight through his head and kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu
retreated backwards by a considerable distance. He stared at Ning, a
look of helplessness and resentment in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admit defeat?”
Ning was a bit speechless. Although his main goal was to acquire the
Heavengazer Tower of Radiance, True God Shiyu was an excellently
skilled foe. Such a foe was not easy to find! He had actually been
able to resist more than ten sword-strikes from Ning, who had been
using the three main attacking stances of [Brightmoon]. This was
truly incredible, as even Ning believed himself to have reached the
overlord level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly treasured
the chance to fight against such a formidable foe. After all, at
present Ning didn’t have any plans to fight against Elder Gods or
Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire prisonworld
only had a total of sixteen imprisoned Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals! All sixteen of them had foundations that were superior to
his, and they surely had far greater insights into the Dao as well.
The True Gods and True Immortals here couldn’t be compared to them.
Most likely, Ning wouldn’t necessarily be a match for them even
when simply comparing offensive attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, although
Ning had fifth-stage swordforce and attack speed that surpassed the
Heavenly Daos, True God Shiyu had mastered and merged fifth-stage
taiji-force and infiniforce. Although True God Shiyu’s body was a
bit weaker, he was still able to hold out against Ning for quite a
long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals would most likely have an even higher level of
attainment in the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had a stronger
foundation and more insights into the Dao. The only advantage Ning
had was Violetjewel, which gave him some degree of confidence in
being able to retreat safely. However, it was also quite possible
that the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had some special tricks
up their sleeves as well. Their bodies and Jindans were all
equivalent to that of the Lord of All Fiends, after all! Individuals
at this level of power couldn’t be judged according to common
standards. Even in the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea, they were second
only to those three World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The techniques of
Pangaea were somewhat more advanced than the techniques of the Three
Realms as well. What abilities did these sixteen Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had? Nint wasn’t sure, and he wasn’t
confident in fighting them. If his true body was killed in battle,
rebuilding it would be no easy task. This was because Ning’s
‘spare’ clone had also become a True God as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one clone advanced
to a new stage, all other clones would make the same breakthrough.
This was one of the hidden laws which governed the world. When the
breakthrough was made, the primordial chaos would be agitated as it
voluntarily sent its power into the bodies of the clones. Thus, the
‘spare’ clone was also filled with the power of primordial chaos,
and also became a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To remake seventeen
True God bodies would require an exceedingly long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I admit defeat.
Last time, I was easily able to defend against you, even when you
were in your three-headed, six-armed form.” True God Shiyu shook
his head. “Now, I’m using six arms of my own, but you are able to
push me back so easily with just a single sword. I’m exhausted. I
can sense that if you send a few more sword-strikes my way, I will
definitely lose. You’ve improved your sword-arts so quickly, and
its speed surpasses the limits of the Heavenly Daos. I’m thoroughly
convinced by my defeat and of your superiority. I can give you my
three Chaos treasures…but I hope in the future you will give me my
freedom when you have the power to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, he would
have to follow his lifeblood oath and leave the Three Realms, as
Mother Nuwa had done before him. He would enter the primordial chaos
and search for Vastheaven Palace. If he had the power to release the
prisoners of the prisonworld by then, he would do so.

Chapter 4 - The Crescent World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu was
highly skilled in defensive techniques and fleeing maneuvers,
precisely because he was someone who valued his own life dearly. He
obediently bent the knee and submitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning soulscoured
him, took his three Chaos treasures, then left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was so
astonishingly powerful and dazzling, even amongst True Gods and True
Immortals. As expected, there were some marvelous reasons for that.”
After soulscouring him, Ning had learned that True God Shiyu had once
acquired the legacy of a deceased World God along with four Chaos
treasures. The Heavengazer Tower of Radiance was one of the four.
True God Shiyu had traded two of the other Chaos treasures for a
‘Darkwind Skysplitter Cudgel’. His possession of this cudgel was
an important part of the reason why he was able to fight back against
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals despite being a mere True
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Shiyu had
learned powerful divine abilities from that legacy, but alas, all of
those divine abilities were sealed with a lifeblood oath. Not even
soulscouring him had allowed Ning to acquire them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had searched
through the memories of many True Gods and True Immortals by now.
Each of them had experienced special encounters which had allowed
them to reach this level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning landed
atop a mountain. He waved his hand, producing a small tower before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tower was
completely silvery-white in color, and it was covered with a faint
aura of golden light. The tower was shaped just like a pyramid. Ning
held the small tower up with one hand, sending his senses inside of
it. He could sense that spacetime within the tower was rather
chaotic. Normally, spacetime should be extremely stable and hard to
disrupt. Daofather Subhuti was capable of affecting spacetime, and
this little tower was also capable of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind.” Ning
immediately sent his divine power into the tower, binding this Chaos
treasure. As he bound it, he immediately made it suppress its aura.
It became quite unremarkable to behold, no longer emitting any golden
light at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before being bound, a
treasure would generally emit an aura of power. After being bound,
everything was up to the desire of the treasure’s owner. It would
be very easy to change its appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In I go.” Ning
willed himself inside. He disappeared from the mountain. The only
thing left was the pyramid-shaped tower, levitating in the air at the
peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
at his surroundings. This was a region that merely had a perimeter of
three hundred meters. The region was pyramid-shaped and seemed
extremely stable, but the flow of time was clearly quite different
inside here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strange.” Ning
raised his head to look at the pyramid-shaped region he was in. At
the very tip of the pyramid, circles of dim light could be seen where
spacetime was rippling faintly. These dim circles of light could be
also be seen at each of the four corners of the pyramid. Ning’s
divine power filled the entire tower, and thus he could use it to
‘see’ the many divine runes that were constantly flowing through
the insides of the tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has changed
spacetime, and in an extremely stable manner.” Ning sighed softly
in amazement. “Although Mother Nuwa was able to do this, that was
only with a grand formation. In addition, it was only possible in a
set location that couldn’t be moved. This Chaos treasure,
however…the person who created the Heavengazer Tower was most
likely even more formidable than Mother Nuwa, the creator of the Six
Paths of Reincarnation. But of course, Mother Nuwa entered the
primordial chaos long ago. I imagine she’s even more formidable now
than she was in the past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s thoughts and
memories were linked to his clones in the outside world. He could
thus naturally sense how much more quickly time was progressing
within the tower. The difference was quite obvious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to speed up the
flow of time.” Ning immediately began to test out the process of
further speeding up time. His Immortal energy began to rapidly
deplete, and the flow of time began to speed up as well, going from
ten times to twenty times, then thirty times. His energy began to
deplete more and more rapidly as the tower’s energy consumption
began to skyrocket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At twenty times the
normal rate of time, I use up energy at the same rate as I replenish
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty times the
normal rate of time starts to take a bit of effort.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forty times…I can
still handle it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty times…getting
difficult!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt
after increasing the flow of speed to fifty times that of the outside
world. He smiled. “My true body and my Primaltwin are both inside
the tower; this places a major burden on it. However, when my true
body is outside battling, I can have my Primaltwin calmly spend its
time meditating in the tower. That’ll be ideal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
immediately left the Heavengazer Tower, leaving behind only the
black-robed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maintaining fifty
times the normal flow of time…I’m still using up a lot of energy,
but it’s much easier now than before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty times…the
energy usage is getting fast again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy times…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred times…this
is getting difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two hundred
times…energy is being used up way too fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
times…the amount of energy being used up is astonishing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of getting
a better sense of how much energy would be used, Ning continued to
furiously increase the flow of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four hundred times!
Five hundred times! Six hundred times! A thousand times!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a thousand times the
normal flow of time, half of his energy was consumed in an instant.
Shocked, Ning finally came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a limit to
how much the Heavengazer Tower can speed up the flow of time.”
Thanks to his control over this treasure, Ning could tell that there
was a limit to its power. He nodded to himself. “According to what
I just sensed…a thousand times should be that limit. However, I can
only maintain that speed for two seconds. Training requires time. I
need to at least be able to train for a hundred years worth of time
in the outside world. A hundred years of time in the outside world
translates into thousands or tens of thousands of years within the
tower. If I use up energy too quickly, no amount of spirit-pills will
suffice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent a few moments
calculating and pondering. In the end, given that the Endwar was
looming, Ning decided to take the risk of maintaining a flow of time
that was a hundred times that of the outside world’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll need to
prepare some extra Great Firmament Immortal pills to stay at this
speed for an extended period of time. It’s now time to return to
the Three Realms.” The white-robed Ning put the tower away, then
left the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primaltwin remained
inside the tower. It needed to spend time meditating on the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s goal was to
master an entire Heavenly Dao! He could only do this upon returning
to the Three Realms. There was no way to meditate on other Daos when
within the endless primordial chaos. Upon mastering a Heavenly Dao,
Ning would have a chance of becoming an Ancestral Immortal or an
Elder God. His power would definitely surpass that of an
overlord-class Daofather by then!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning didn’t
dare to feel too confident. The Lord of All Fiends was an Elder God
himself! He had been able to escape from the clutches of Mother Nuwa,
who had broken through to become a World God, and he was the person
who worried Ning the most. In addition, more than half a chaos cycle
had gone by since the end of the Primordial Era. That was enough time
for a minor figure to become a mighty one! How powerful were the two
alliances? Hard to say. Things would only be made clear when the
Endwar came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And…what was the
cause of this great war?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was still a mystery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he already
stood at the very peak of power in the Three Realms, Ning still
wished to reach even higher heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the endless
Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere. He stared at the distant Solar Star, blazing with seemingly
infinite heat, then gave the icy Lunar Star a glance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms.”
Ning murmured softly to himself, then took out a message talisman and
filled it with his Immortal energy, notifying his master of his
arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.”
Subhuti’s voice echoed within the empty space around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I wish to
return to the Crescent world,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Instantly, a spatial whirlpool appeared in the empty space around
him. Ning gave the spatial whirlpool a hard look. He could now
vaguely sense that aside from changing space, this whirlpool also
made slight alterations to time. The Crescent world didn’t exist in
the same temporal dimension as the rest of the major worlds of the
Three Realms, which was why the other major powers had no way of
finding it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped into the
spatial vortex and disappeared from the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blue skies and white
clouds greeted his arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared in the
middle of the air. “Eh?” Ning glanced downwards with surprise,
seeing a beautiful island off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master actually led
me here?” Ning was quite surprised, as he thought that the
whirlpool would’ve led straight to Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Uncle White.
Little Qing. And…my daughter Brightmoon? All of them are on the
island?” Ning became even more surprised. His ‘spare’
Primaltwin clone was still by his daughter’s side, albeit quietly
hidden. It wouldn’t make an appearance unless his daughter was in
grave danger. Upon arriving, Ning could sense that his Primaltwin was
right at that island. Clearly, his daughter, Little Qing, and Uncle
White were there as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s already a
Celestial Immortal. Why is she staying on this island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, Master
always brought me directly to Mount Innerheart. Why has he brought me
here, this time?” Ning felt quite curious, but he still flew
downwards. As he moved closer to the island, he could sense his heart
clench involuntarily. Ning gave the beautiful island a closer look,
and as he did his face blanched as though he had seen something
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation…it’s
so mysterious, but even the tiny bit of it that I can sense is
utterly terrifying.” Ning felt dread in his heart. He was already
an overlord-class figure, but he could still feel a vague sense of
danger emanating from this island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, come in.”
Subhuti’s voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning quickly
landed. Although this island held a terrifying formation within it,
the formation didn’t act to impede him at all. Ning was able to
easily and safely land on the sandy beaches, and as he did he
immediately saw a distant group of Immortals flying around in the
skies above the island. He also saw a number of linked palaces that
radiated mighty auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t that the
Carefree Immortal Palace of Exalted Celestial Carefree? That’s a
top-grade Protocosmic estate-treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…that’s the
Three Realms Dragonrover Ark of Daofather Snowdragon?”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a half-step Elder
God, Ji Ning possessed incredibly sharp vision. When he swept the
island with his gaze, he saw many Immortal palaces, flying arks, and
mazes that were extremely famous in the Three Realms. Many were
treasures belonging to True Gods and Daofathers, and all of them
possessed extremely powerful defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, look, that’s Sword Immortal Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he is Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard Father say
that Sword Immortal Darknorth’s sword-arts are absolutely
astonishing. In fact, his sword-arts are the best sword-arts of the
Three Realms, and he’s just as powerful as Father is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Best in the Three
Realms? That’s a bit exaggerated, isn’t it? He’s simply
mastered the [Five Treasures]; his swordforce is still merely at the
fourth stage. His true body has been wiped out by the Seamless Gate
as well. When he was using the Envoy, he was perhaps comparable to
Master, but I heard that the Envoy’s been ruined. With his true
body lost as well…he surely is much weaker than Master now. He was
born at the wrong time. If he was given another ten thousand years,
he would probably be far more powerful than he is now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. That’s Ji
Ning over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such a pity. I heard
that he was ambushed by the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The killer was
Swordfather Darklight…supposedly, he was killed by Houyi
afterwards. Houyi truly is incredible. He didn’t even use his
arrows; he just used a single blow from his hatchet to kill
Swordfather Darklight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My senior
apprentice-sister told me that Ji Ning’s talent is absolutely
incredible. He’s no less talented than Houyi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps. But for
now, there’s no way that Ji Ning can be compared to Houyi; the
difference in power is simply too great. If his true body was still
alive, then after a few million years he would perhaps be a match for
Houyi. Now, however…there’s no hope of it happening.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island wasn’t
that large, just a few hundred thousand kilometers in size. Given how
many Immortals were present, quite a few noticed as soon as Ning
arrived on the island. All of them felt pity for Ning. They all felt
that Ning had been born at the wrong time! He was born with utterly
astonishing talent, but alas he had been born just a little too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
So many treasures have appeared here, and the secret formation
protecting this island is utterly terrifying…” Ning’s heart was
filled with questions. “And these Immortals…there are even
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals here, many of whom are the
descendants and progency of major powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come over here.” A
mental message was sent to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look in
towards the direction from which the message had come. His eyes were
filled with torch-light, and he was able to see a seemingly ordinary
Daoist monastery looked far off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Ning was
truly stunned now. This was the monastery which Patriarch Subhuti
lived in. It had been located on Mount Innerheart for countless
years. Why did it now appear atop this island?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning
immediately flew a hundred thousand kilometers before landing before
the monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.”
Standing at the entrance of the monastery were the two Dao-novices,
Clearwater and Whiteriver. Both of them called out quite
respectfully, and their eyes were filled with curiosity and
admiration as they stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning relaxed slightly
upon seeing these two ‘children’. Their presence meant that
everything should be fine. Ning immediately strode into the
monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, he saw the
white-haired Patriarch Subhuti seated on the ground in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
immediately walked towards him, then respectfully knelt on the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” Subhuti
smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position as he looked at his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you
curious?” Subhuti looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I am.”
Ning nodded. “The Crescent world…in the past, this island didn’t
exist. Now, it suddenly has appeared out of nowhere, and has such a
terrifying formation protecting it! The estate-treasures, palaces,
and flying arks of many major powers are here as well, as well as
many of their disciples and progeny. And you, Master…you actually
moved your own monastery here as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, can it be
that the major powers of the Three Realms are using this place as
their refuge?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded. “This
place has indeed become a place of refuge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt an uneasy
feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Lord
Tathagata the Buddha, Daoist Three Purities, the Primordial Imperial
Clan…they each have their own abilities. It shouldn’t be hard for
them to protect their disciples and progeny. Why is it that they’ve
all been moved over to the Crescent world?” Ning hurriedly asked,
“Has the war taken a turn for the worse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has indeed, but
we are doing this just to prepare for the worst,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really has taken
a turn for the worse?” Ning was shocked. He had only spent six
years in the prisonworld. How could such drastic changes have
occurred in the outside world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen to me
carefully,” Subhuti said. “When the Seamless Gate ambushed you,
we negotiated with them and agreed that they were no longer to use
Envoys in the war for karmic luck, while you were not to participate
either. After the negotiations, the Realmwars began once more, and
everything proceeded as we expected. However, half a year ago…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked. Something unexpected had happened half a year ago?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half a year ago,
Daoist Three Purities could sense that given how ferocious the war
for karmic luck had become, as soon as it ended the Endwar would
immediately begin! Aside from our two sides, there are two other
forces that we have to reckon with. If they aren’t dealt with, then
it is very possible that those two forces will take advantage of our
conflict to become the final winner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two other forces?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first is Old Man
Yuan’s forces,” Patriarch Subhuti said. “The Four Ancestors of
the River Source aren’t that powerful; before the Endwar begins,
they will have to choose to join one side or another. In truth, they
aren’t powerful enough to try and take advantage of the war to
become the final victor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second,
however…is the Primordial Ruinworld!” Patriarch Subhuti had a
solemn look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was suddenly
jolted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld! He had been so focused on the Seamless Gate that he had
nearly forgotten the Primordial Ruinworld. When he had been exiled
into the Nihilum Zone, he had suffered attacks from the Snaphorn
world of the Primordial Ruinworld. In the end, it had been his master
Subhuti who had intervened to rescue him and wipe out those three
Queen Mothers. The Snaphorn world was just a weak power in the
Primordial Ruinworld; if the entire Ruinworld rose up together, they
would constitute a terrifyingly powerful force! Not even True Gods or
Daofathers would dare to casually enter the Primordial Ruinworld;
they could very well die if they did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial
Ruinworld is far more powerful than the Four Ancestors of the River
Source,” Patriarch Subhuti said. “After the war that ended the
Primordial Era, Mother Nuwa drove all of those alien Outsiders into
the harsh environment of the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
Primordial Ruinworld’s environment was indeed harsh and
inhospitable. Both space and time were scrambled there. The
environment itself was quite deadly; ordinary True Gods and
Daofathers could easily die if they encountered a shattered region of
spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Mother Nuwa
became a Pangu-level divinity,” Subhuti explained, “She
invincibly dominated all her opponents. The reason why she didn’t
wipe out the alien Outsiders was because she wanted to leave them
behind for us as ‘neighbors’, constantly reminding us of the
importance of being vigilant. We were to never again engage in
internal civil wars. In fact, their very existence was a way of
subtly ensuring that we would continue to train and grow more
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother Nuwa’s
actions were quite correct, and we agreed with them back then. During
the Primordial Era there were no outside invaders and so we
constantly engaged in internal wars, causing many major powers to
perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since Mother
Nuwa left them behind, we have never again engaged in large-scale
civil wars,” Subhuti said. “In fact, experts from the Three
Realms will often enter the Primordial Ruinworld region to test and
temper themselves. This has resulted in the Immortals and Fiendgods
of the Nuwa Alliance to constantly grow more powerful, resulting in
quite a few new True Gods and Daofathers being born.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. An outside
threat was a good way to ensure internal unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities decided that before we were to begin the Endwar against the
Seamless Gate, we should first deal with the Primordial Ruinworld,”
Patriarch Subhuti said. “Those alien Outsiders have been forced to
live in the deadly Ruinworlds, and they have always wished to enter
our Three Realms. Once both the Seamless Gate and our Nuwa Alliance
are both exhausted by the Endwar, they will definitely seize this
opportunity to invade from the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
agreed with this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, we raised
this mater with the Seamless Gate. Since there’s no way to avoid
the Endwar, it would be best if both sides join together to deal with
this future threat first.” Patriarch Subhuti shook his head. “But
the Seamless Gate was completely disinterested in fighting against
the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They weren’t
interested?” Ning was puzzled. “Why is that? Do they want to
leave it up to us to handle? They want the Nuwa Alliance to waste its
own power? But…but they aren’t fools. They should understand that
if we don’t get rid of the Primordial Ruinworld, neither side can
fight the Endwar with confidence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not as simple
as you think.” Subhuti shook his head. “Several other major
powers and I have been investigating in secret. We’ve
discovered…that the Primordial Ruinworld is now filled with many,
many terrifyingly powerful formations. Fuxi has looked at these
formations, and he can recognize them as being the work of Keeper
Everwood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Ning
was shocked. “Did you just say that the Primordial Ruinworld is
filled with many formations that were laid down by Keeper Everwood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Subhuti
nodded. “We can say with a 90% certainty that the Primordial
Ruinworld allied in secret with the Seamless Gate a long time ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold look was in
Subhuti’s eyes. “The Seamless Gate…we permitted them to remain
in the Three Realms and live amongst us, but now, for the sake of
winning the Endwar, they actually dare to ally with those alien
Outsiders? Have they forgotten? The great war between the two
chaosworlds was instigated by those alien Outsiders to begin with!
Hmph. Hmph! Enough of that. As far as those of us from the Pangu
Chaosworld are concerned, the Seamless Gate is also an organization
of alien Outsiders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Ning quickly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You saw it for
yourself. The Crescent world has become a place of refuge.” Subhuti
said coldly. “We have already sent a strike force of major powers
deep into the Primordial Ruinworld. We are going to wipe out all of
the alien Outsiders within the Ruinworld!”
</P>

Chapter 6 - Those We Protect
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe out all the
alien Outsiders in the Primordial Ruinworld?” Ji Ning was rather
worried. “Is that really doable?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that they’ve
joined forces with the Seamless Gate, it’s uncertain,” Subhuti
said. “However, the major powers that we sent out are led by Fuxi
and Tathagata.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi is a master of
formations and skilled in tying down foes, while Buddha Tathagata
possesses incredible defenses and is skilled in dealing with
dangerous situations. With them leading the strike force, even if
unexpected circumstances arose they would be able to hold out for a
period of time, more than enough time for reinforcements to make it
to their side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning relaxed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was the number one
formations expert of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata could be said
to have the most durable divine body of all major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are leading a
total of nineteen Daofathers with them on this strike mission,
including both elite Daofathers and ordinary Daofathers,” Subhuti
said. “They will work in unison, but they’ll split up into four
squads to do so. All four squads will simultaneously attack a single
world together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single world?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The
Primordial Ruinworld has many worlds within it,” Subhuti said. “The
Snaphorn world you encountered in the past was just an ordinary,
unremarkable, small part of the Ruinworld. We’re not sure about
exactly what the Ruinworld holds either, or what alien Outsider major
powers are hiding where. The only choice we have is to crush all
their worlds, one by one! They’ll simultaneously attack the same
world together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why they
have split up into four squads is because they are worried that they
might fall into an enemy trap or formation,” Subhuti explained. “By
splitting up into four squads as they attack each world, they can
ensure that even if one squad does fall into a trap formation, the
other three squads would immediately become aware of it and will thus
be on their guard, and can also go reinforce them and rescue them.
That way, even if the Seamless Gate or the Primordial Ruinworld have
set up traps, they won’t be able to get all of us at once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He was
silent for a moment, then said solemnly, “Master, I wish to go to
the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to take
part in the battle?” Subhuti was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was silent for
a moment, then looked at Ning. “In the Primordial Ruinworld, both
space and time are in a state of chaos. They are located in an
extremely dangerous part of the Ruinworld right now. If you were to
enter, you would first need to join together with them, but we don’t
have a clear sense of where they are exactly. This is because the
Primordial Ruinworld is simply too chaotic. I would only be able to
tell you the general region they are in. It would be very dangerous
for you to try and join together with those squads.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti said these
words in the hope that Ning would change his mind. He knew, after
all, that Ning’s Envoy had already been ruined!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m confident in
my abilities.” Ning looked at his master, and as he did his eyes
flashed with hidden sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Upon
seeing that seven-colored sword-light flash in his disciple’s eyes,
Patriarch Subhuti felt stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">B-but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had mastered
fifth-stage taiji-force, which was already quite impressive. But now,
Ji Ning had mastered fifth-stage swordforce, which possessed even
more powerful offensive abilities! It must be understood that the
reason why Swordfather Darklight was so powerful as an assassin,
powerful enough to kill Ji Ning’s true body with a single
sword-strike, was because of how powerful his swordforce was! Ji
Ning, however, was different from Swordfather Darklight; his sword
had surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos in terms of speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts alone
would ensure that he would be extremely close to the overlord level
of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that in the blink of an eye, you would’ve reached such a level of
power.” Patriarch Subhuti laughed. “It seems I was worrying over
nothing. You might as well go. You have a self-cloning technique; for
you to adventure through the Primordial Ruinworld won’t be too
great an issue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “Your disciple wishes to first visit with his daughter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your daughter,
Brightmoon, has been worried about you all this time. It is indeed
time for you to visit her,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Worried…” Ning
was stunned for a moment, then nodded gently. He immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti stroked his
beard and smiled as he watched Ning leave. “This old Daoist judged
correctly, all those years ago. Ji Ning’s talent for the sword
truly is superior to his talent for heartforce. In less than a
thousand years, he’s upgraded his sword-arts to such an incredible
level. His sword-arts alone shall ensure that he can stare down upon
the entire Three Realms from his lofty perch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the side of a lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed maiden
was quietly seated by the lakeside, staring at the waters of the
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon.”
Autumn Leaf walked to her side and called out to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed maiden
turned her head to glance at her, then turned to stare at the lake
once more. She stared at the lake silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong? Why
are you unhappy?” Autumn Leaf asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine, Aunt.”
The black-robed maiden shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Worried about your
father?” Autumn Leaf sat down next to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed maiden
hesitated a moment, then nodded slowly. “A little. Father’s been
completely devoted to his cultivation, and he was the only figure
ever since the Primordial Era who was comparable to Houyi. But
Aunt…you must have heard it as well. Those people were saying that
Father’s true body was slain by the Seamless Gate. They said that
Father’s golem was destroyed as well. I didn’t believe it, so I
went to ask Patriarch Subhuti…and the Old Patriarch didn’t deny
it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop worrying.”
Autumn Leaf stretched her arms out to gently take Brightmoon into her
embrace. “I watched your father grow up. Your father will ignore
all setbacks and continue to grow more and more powerful. He
definitely won’t despair. He will never give up. You need to have
faith in your father.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you tell me some
more stories about Father?” Brightmoon looked at Autumn Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Autumn
Leaf laughed and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Uncle White,
and Little Qing were watching the two from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance’s
major powers have all moved their progeny and disciples here. Thus,
Ji Ning, there was no way for us to continue hiding from Brightmoon
what had happened to you on the Deerchaser world,” Uncle White
said. “Brightmoon didn’t believe it at first and she even argued
with them. Afterwards, she paid a personal visit to Patriarch
Subhuti…only then did she truly believe the stories about what had
happened on the Deerchaser world. She’s been worried about you for
months now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning looked
at his daughter, a warm feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. When she sees
you, she’ll definitely be very happy,” Uncle White said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
walked towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
speaking to Brightmoon in a soft voice, telling her of her father’s
stories. Brightmoon was listening intently. No matter how often she
heard these stories, she never got tired of them. She always hoped to
hear more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly felt a
sense of guilt. He really was a failure of a father, having made his
daughter worry so much about him. Although one of his clones had been
quietly protecting his daughter this entire time, that clone had
always kept in hiding, not even paying attention to the affairs of
the outside world. Only when his daughter was in danger would certain
restrictive seals be dispelled, allowing the clone to take a look at
what was happening outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been many years,
but the clone had never been activated. Thus, Ning didn’t know
anything at all about what had happened in the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My clone’s been
staying in hiding all this time. Although this helps to temper
her…perhaps sometimes, love is more important than training?”
Ning quietly pondered to himself. “Was I wrong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father!”
Brightmoon had turned her head, as though she had sensed his
presence. When she saw Ning standing behind her, she immediately
clambered to her feet in surprise and delight, then charged straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. You finally
came back! I’ve been waiting forever and ever for you. You’ve
been gone for way, way, way too long.” Brightmoon clutched at Ning,
babbling nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently stroked his
daughter’s hair. Ever since she had become a Celestial Immortal and
manifested her body, she had chosen this appearance for herself. She
looked very similar to her mother, Yu Wei. In fact, she also liked to
wear black clothes. When Ning looked at his daughter, he sometimes
felt as though his wife was by his side. However, his wife’s gaze
was soft and steadier, while his daughter’s gaze was filled with
veneration and love.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His wife was a bit
colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter was a bit
more playful and hyper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, the
Immortals and Fiendgods on the island are all saying that your true
body was destroyed. They said you…” Brightmoon looked at Ning,
her hands tightly wrapped around Ning’s arm. She said softly, “Can
you stop fighting against the Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The elders and
teachers of those Immortals and Fiendgods on the island…are any of
them shirking in their duties?” Ning shook his head. “I cannot
simply run and hide. You should understand, Brightmoon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Father, you’ve
already sacrificed enough. Your true body was destroyed and you’ve
been drastically weakened. What more do they want from you? Father,
you are now just a True Immortal. Even if you have powerful
heartforce and can use it to command the Rahu Formation, you still
aren’t a True God or a Daofather. There are many Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals on the island who aren’t taking part in the war.
You’ve already done much more than them, Father.” Brightmoon
looked at Ning, at the verge of tears. “I’m so afraid. I’m
afraid that your Primaltwin will also be killed. I’ve already lost
Mother. I can’t lose you too!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Promise me.”
Brightmoon looked at Ning. “Just stay with me. Alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll stay with
you.” Ning’s heart ached when he saw that look in his daughter’s
eyes. He nodded gently. “I’ll always stay with you. From today
onwards, my Primaltwin will stay with you here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwin?”
Brightmoon was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you know? I
only wear white robes with my true body.” Ning patted Brightmoon on
the head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought…I
thought…” A look of joy appeared in Brightmoon’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Others might
underestimate your father, but you really should not.” Ning
laughed. “My true body and my Primaltwin are both fine. In fact,
I’m even more powerful than before.” Ning stretched his hand out,
and his hand glowed dimly with a seven-colored sword-light. The
dazzling, brilliant rainbow sword-light possessed an aura of utterly
terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon stared at
the rainbow sword-light in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was Ji Ning’s
daughter, and a disciple of Mount Innerheart. She naturally knew many
things. Given that Ji Ning walked the path of the Sword Immortal,
Brightmoon had learned long ago what fifth-stage swordforce was like.
Thus, she recognized it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, y-you…”
Brightmoon was filled with both joy and pride. Fifth-stage
swordforce, and speed which surpassed the limits of the Heavenly
Daos? This was her father! Those Immortals and Fiendgods had all been
prattling on and on, but her father had actually become far more
powerful than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, you said you
were going to have your Primaltwin stay by my side. Then…your true
body…?” Brightmoon suddenly realized what this meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Will
go out and fight, of course. Your father can’t just hide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
Brightmoon chewed on her lips, then said softly, “I, I really don’t
want you to go to war any longer, Father.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar is nigh.
We have to step forward to face it,” Ning said it with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the skies
collapse, let the big guys handle it,” Brightmoon argued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your father is now
one of the big guys,” Ning laughed. “Enough. You are a Celestial
Immortal now, you know. You are acting like a little girl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter was by his
side once more. Ning could sense a surge of strength and energy come
from his heart in an unbroken stream. It came from an absolutely
indomitable determination that was etched into his very bones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to protect my
daughter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if it costs me
my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
turned his head, giving the black-robed maiden who was standing at
the side of the lake a final glance. Then, he cast aside all his
doubt. “Master, send me away,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful in the
Primordial Ruinworld.” Subhuti’s voice rang out by Ning’s ears
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A spatial vortex
appeared in front of Ning. Ning stepped into it.

Chapter 7 - Darkstill World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone of the
Primordial Ruinworld. The waves of the Void continuously came
crashing through this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A spatial
whirlpool appeared within the Void, and from it emerged a white-robed
youth. He stood there in the Void, staring towards the infinitely
vast realm that was before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
Master said, right now Fuxi and Tathagata’s squads are around the
Darkstill world.” Ning’s eyes were blazing with torch-light,
allowing him to clearly see the enormous, distant realm of the
Primordial Ruinworld. He was quickly able to identify the region that
was known as the Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld had been divided up into many parts by various alien
Outsider organizations into many different ‘worlds’. The closer
these worlds were to the core, the more powerful they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Snaphorn’
world was one of the outermost border worlds of the Primordial
Ruinworld. Comparatively speaking, it was fairly weak. The most
powerful members of the Snaphorn world were those three Queen
Mothers, and strictly speaking they weren’t really at the level of
True Gods or Daofathers! Empyrean God Redsnow, when commanding a
Seven Planets God, had been able to battle against all three of them
for a long period of time. Patriarch Subhuti had been able to easily
annihilate all of them with a single palm. From this, one could see
how weak the Snaphorn world had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darkstill world was
far more powerful than the Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld. The Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space was forcibly torn
apart, allowing a white-robed youth to fly to this location atop a
boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Darkstill
world…it really is a dark, silent place.” Ning swept the area
with his gaze. Even the skies were grey and dark. Everything seemed
to be covered by a hazy layer of gray fog, and it was completely
silent here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder where Fuxi,
Tathagata, and the other Daofathers are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Primaltwin was
still in the Crescent world. Ning had made a special Primaltwin
incarnation to accompany Brightmoon, with the incarnation being able
to converse with Patriarch Subhuti whenever necessary. According to
what he had heard, Fuxi, Tathagata, and their squads were currently
located at the Darkstill world, but it would be hard to find their
exact locations without being there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main reason was
because spacetime was in a state of chaotic flux here. One could set
clear target coordinates for teleportation, but upon actually
arriving one might be ridiculously far off from the original target!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Subhuti
had sent Ning to the Nihilum Zone, then told Ning to board his
Voidship and fly from the Nihilum Zone to the Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me search for
them.” Ning immediately sent out his heartforce. Whoosh! His
heartforce rippled out like the waters of a lake, spreading out in
every single direction. This was a little trick which World God
Northrest had taught him. With this technique activated, no one in
either the Three Realms or the Primordial Ruinworld would be able to
escape his detection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce quickly
spread out to encompass an enormous region. It spread out past tall
mountains, deep lakes, and quite a few alien Outsiders. Those alien
Outsiders were all quite weak. They weren’t even close to becoming
Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned. There were some regions where both space and time were both
so badly shattered that not even Ning’s heartforce could see past
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m only able to
scan a region of a few hundred thousand kilometers. There’s no way
to scan any further.” This was Ning’s first trip into the actual
Primordial Ruinworld itself, and it was the fairly stable Darkstill
world. He immediately understood why this place was known as the
‘Ruinworld’! Such a dire, inhospitable environment simply wasn’t
suitable for life to flourish on a large scale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t able to
find Fuxi and the others…however, towards the east I can see some
signs of a battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Ning immediately
transformed into a black lightning serpent, instantly flying more
than two hundred thousand kilometers east towards the region which
had been scarred by battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By ‘east’, Ning was
referring to the direction from which the Solar Star would rise.
Thus, in the Three Realms and in the Primordial Ruinworld, east meant
a different direction for different worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here?” Ning stood
there in midair, staring down at the vast basin below him. The basin
was shaped like an enormous palm print that was more than a thousand
kilometers wide, and the ground below it was completely scorched
black. “A palm? Could it be that Tathagata launched a strike?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reverse.” Ning
immediately willed a temporal inversion to begin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In places like the
Primordial Ruinworld where the Heavenly Daos did not exist it was
extremely difficult to use temporal inversion techniques. However, as
Ning had slowly gained more insight into the Nine Chaos Seals, he was
instantly able to see into the past history of most mortals. He had
gained the ability to easily seeing into the past, which was really
the fundamental essence of how the ‘temporal inversion’ technique
worked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning was able to
easily accomplish the temporal inversion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many images of the past
began to flash past Ning. Soon, time had ‘inverted’ back to a
point where four major powers had appeared in this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those four major powers
were led by the smiling yellow-robed Lord Buddha, Tathagata. By his
side were three other Buddhas, each of which glowed with boundless
holy light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darkstill, you think
to stop us with small tricks such as these?” Tathagata flew forward
atop an auspicious cloud, a smile on his face as he spoke. “Hurry
up and show yourself. Otherwise…your Darkstill world won’t exist
for much longer.” As he spoke, he stretched out his hand. Shining
with golden light, his hand descended from the heavens and smashed
downwards towards the land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground trembled
violently as a massive palm-sized basin was imprinted deep into the
earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata!” An
ear-piercing screech rang out, but it was quickly silenced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch Darkstill is
one of the most famous major powers of the Primordial Ruinworld.
We’re destroying the various formation bases located throughout his
world, but he still refuses to show himself? He must be scheming
something big,” Tathagata said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Buddha, there’s
no need to worry about his plots and schemes. Let us continue to
destroy their worlds, one by one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Tathagata nodded, then led his three mighty Buddhas to continue
forward to their next destination, flying off on that auspicious
cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.
One gray-skinned, gray-cloaked alien Outsider after another descended
from the heavens. They landed within the basin, then exchanged
glances with each other, their eyes filled with cold rage. They then
flew off as well, heading in the same direction which Tathagata and
the others had just gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning finished
viewing what had happened here roughly two hours ago, he nodded
slightly. “The leader of the Buddhist Sangha and Human Sovereign
Fuxi became overlord-level figures during the Primordial Era. Even
though they haven’t broken through to become Elder Gods, their
techniques have surely become much better. With them in command, and
with their forces split up into four squads…no single world in the
Primordial Ruinworld can possibly withstand all of them at once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning also flew
towards the direction where the others had gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Darkstill
world was located in a region of relatively stable spacetime, there
were still many regions in it where spacetime was distorted. The
alien Outsiders who lived here were used to these regions and knew
them well. There were some regions where only they dared traverse,
and they were only able to do so because generations of predecessors
had sacrificed their lives to help their race accumulate experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A white-robed
youth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s hesitating a
bit. Oh, he’s actually come inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three alien Outsiders
were gathered together within a region of distorted spacetime,
staring past a restrictive formation at the white-robed youth who had
just flown in from the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, the
Buddhist leader of the Three Realms, Tathagata, has led three of his
Daofathers to attack this world. Why has this white-robed youth
appeared?” These three alien Outsiders had pale white skin,
handsome faces, and were dressed in gray cloaks. All of them were
top-tier Empyrean Gods in power, and they were skilled in fleeing
through space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from his
appearance…it should be Sword Immortal Darknorth of the Three
Realms, Ji Ning.” The alien captain frowned. “Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning…his sword-arts are extremely profound, said to
be the best in the entire Three Realms. However, he himself is just a
True Immortal, and his true body has already been destroyed by the
Seamless Gate. The one who just appeared should be his Primaltwin.
Judging from his aura, he should still be just a True Immortal. But
I’m puzzled…why would a True Immotal dare to brave our Primordial
Ruinworld by himself? Is he planning to just rely on his Rahu
Formation? The Heavenly Daos do not exist in the Primordial
Ruinworld; there’s not much natural energy for the Rahu Formation
to make use of. It won’t be nearly as powerful as it was in the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, he’s
advancing quite quickly. He’ll be past our observation range soon,”
one of the alien Outsiders quickly reminded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely hard
to set up an observation formation within a field of distorted
spacetime. There was no way to make it have an extremely long
detection range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go test him
out.” Beneath his gray cloak, the alien captain had a cold look on
his face. “Let’s see how powerful this Pure Yang True Immortal
is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them
quickly flew out in pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments later,
all three of them were dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood quietly
within the Void, giving each of their corpses a glance. “Chase me?”
He was a half-step Elder God. How acute were his senses? As soon as
those three alien Outsiders had gotten slightly closer to him, he had
immediately discovered them. These three puny Empyrean God pawns…Ning
had easily killed two of them, then heavily wounded the third one. He
had planned to soulscour the third one, but alas the alien had
voluntarily destroyed his own soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
Primordial Ruinworld, within a round castle that glowed with dark
golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An alien major power
was seated atop a throne here. He had a long green tail, a bald head,
and handsome features. He was resting his head on his one hand,
contemplating as he tapped the armrest of the throne with his free
hand. Six golden-armored figures stood solemnly at attention before
him, each of which radiated auras that were far superior to the auras
of ordinary Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These aboriginals
really are quite something.” The alien Outsider seated atop the
throne let out a congratulatory chuckle. “They actually destroyed
twelve of my worlds. The Seamless Gate really is useless. They
created all those formations, but not a single one of the True Gods
or Daofathers of the Three Realms have died to them. It seems we
can’t simply rely on those fools after all. In the end, it’ll be
up to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this
chaosworld has given birth to a World God. We cannot be
overconfident.” One of the golden-armored figures standing below
him gave a respectful reminder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘Lord of All
Things’…it’s all his fault for being an idiot!” The seated
alien Outsider laughed coldly. “He spent quite a bit of time roving
about the primordial chaos and has seen quite a few chaosworlds. Back
then, when Nuwa had yet to become a World God, he should’ve
immediately attacked. Instead, he set up a stupid scheme to have the
two chaosworlds fight against each other? How bored was he? Why
didn’t he just destroy one chaosworld, then destroy the other?
Instead, he started a war that caused these primitives to give birth
to a World God. Before she left, she definitely left behind some
techniques for her allies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chaosworld that
had given birth to a World God is not so easily conquered. That’s
the reason why I’ve acted so carefully and waited for the perfect
opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…how about
we just go back for now? Let’s build up our forces before we
return. We know exactly where this place is now. When we are more
powerful, we can return!” A skinny golden-armored figure suggested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider’s long green tail suddenly swept out and knocked the
golden-armored figure flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider pointed at the golden-armored figure and cursed, “You
fool! We barely survived the trip here; you really want us to risk
the trip back? Unless we make a major breakthrough in strength, if we
go back the same way we came in, we are almost guaranteed to die.
It’s better for us to join forces with the Seamless Gate and slowly
grind down the Nuwa alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Almighty
Master!” A voice suddenly called out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darkstill?” The
alien Outsider chortled merrily. “Let him in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a
gray-skinned, golden-robed man strode in, emanating an aura of great
power. It was the master of the Darkstill world, ‘Thearch
Darkstill’. He respectfully fell to his knees. “Almighty Master,
my minions just discovered that yet another invader with the power of
a Daofather has entered the Darkstill world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another enemy
Daofather has come?” The seated alien outsider frowned. “Who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He belongs to the
Nuwa Alliance of the Three Realms,” Thearch Darkstill said
respectfully. “Sword Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning!”
</P>

Chapter 8 - Godfiend Witherspike
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning? Sounds familiar.” The alien Outsider leaned
back against his throne, resting his head against his palm and
muttering to himself. Moments later, his eyes lit up. “I remember
now. I believe he’s one of the fastest-rising stars of the Three
Realms, supposedly as talented as Houyi was. If memory serves, the
Seamless Gate’s intelligence report stated that his true body was
destroyed by them. Only his Primaltwin survives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwins…I
can’t help but feel jealous just thinking about them. Those mortal
creatures who slowly rise to power have the chance to form a
Primaltwin. We Fiendgods who are born from the primordial chaos don’t
even have the chance to do that.” The alien Outsider shook his head
and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can those mortal
creatures be compared to you, Master?” One of the six
golden-armored figures, a red-bearded elder, immediately spoke out in
protest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” The
seated alien Outsider laughed loudly, his laughter echoing within the
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he stopped
laughing, he looked downwards at the still-kneeling Thearch
Darkstill. “Darkstill, you said that he has the power of a True God
and Daofather? Isn’t he just a third-tier True Immortal? Low-class
True Immortals like him are numerous beyond count in the primordial
chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three of my minions
were slain by this Ji Ning. One of them, prior to dying, sent the
scenes of his death back to our race,” Thearch Darkstill said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The scenes of his
death?” The seated alien Outsider was intrigued. “Let me take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” Thearch
Darkstill assented respectfully, then pointed towards an empty space
nearby. Instantly, moving images began to appear there. The scene
displayed the three gray-robed aliens moving forward. Suddenly, a
black streak of lightning flashed past them, instantly piercing
through their bodies. The black lightning serpent was simply far too
fast; although the three of them could sense how dangerous it was and
had wanted to flee, they simply weren’t able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single flash,
the black lightning serpent slew two of the three gray-robed figures
and heavily injured the third. The scene then switched to that of a
white-robed youth reaching his out with his hand, intending to
soulscour the survivor. However, the gray-robed survivor instantly
committed suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite fast.” The
seated alien Outsider’s eyes lit up. He laughed merrily, “Those
fools of the Seamless Gate…they claimed that Ji Ning’s true body
was killed. Just now, he used the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
evasion technique, something which only a Fiendgod can use. Clearly,
his true body isn’t dead after all. The exalted Seamless Gate…it
couldn’t even handle something as simple as this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s not
dead.” One of the gold-armored figures who had just one arm frowned
as he spoke. “And for him to be able to use it while slaying three
Empyrean Gods in an instant…and he wasn’t even using a sword.
Just now, he used his fingers to execute sword-arts. This set of
sword-arts…incredible, simply incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill
agreed. “Venerable Saber speaks the truth. In the Three Realms, Ji
Ning has been acknowledged as possessing the most profound
sword-arts. It is said that he wields fourth-stage swordforce, with
the speed of his sword exceeding the limits of the Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider had six retainers, but the only one which Thearch Darkstill
truly admired was the single-armed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The
single-armed man shook his head. “He was able to display his
sword-arts so easily while using the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent]…this level of perfection in the sword isn’t something
which someone merely at the fourth stage of swordforce can
accomplish. If my guess is correct…he has quite possibly reached
the fifth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage of
swordforce?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
figures next to him all called out in surprise. Even Thearch
Darkstill was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider frowned as he looked at the one-armed man. “Saber, are you
sure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just my
conjecture. His sword-arts were too fast, after all, and he used them
while executing the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]. I wasn’t able to
see it too clearly, so I’m just making an educated guess.” After
speaking, the one-armed man no longer said a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider pondered for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had collected these
six retainers while roaming through the endless primordial chaos. Of
the six, ‘Saber’ had voluntarily decided to join him in order to
repay a debt of gratitude and voluntarily decided to call him
‘Master’. Saber was also the only retainer who this figure truly
respected. As for the other five? He hit them and berated them as he
pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had
arrived at the Primordial Ruinworld, he had easily subjugated and
taken control over all of the alien Outsiders here, including the
most powerful ones such as Thearch Darkstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Saber is
willing to make the claim…it probably really is true,” he
murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
similarities between the usage of a sword and the usage of a saber.
Both were weapons meant for attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he has
fifth-stage swordforce…?” The seated alien Outsider stared into
the looping scenes, peering at those three gray-robed figures as they
died again and again. “He’s reached such a level despite having
trained for less than a thousand years. He really is terrifying. But
of course, it’s also possible that Saber’s conjecture is wrong.
Still, no matter what, for him to be able to kill those three in such
a short period of time means that he definitely has the power of a
Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Intriguing.” The
seated alien Outsider chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven.” He
sent a mental call directly out to Blackheaven. “Come here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was relaxing and drinking wine in another part of the
castle. This time, he was the one responsible for delivering messages
on behalf of the Seamless Gate! This was a golem-body he was using,
and so even if it was destroyed he wouldn’t care in the slightest.
He naturally was quite relaxed and content.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.”
Blackheaven picked up the jug of wine and headed off. No one barred
his path, and a short while later he arrived at the place where the
alien Outsiders were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respectful
greetings to you, great Godfiend Witherspike.” Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven chortled merrily as he bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time I see you,
I feel happy.” The seated alien Outsider smiled merrily back at
him. “That idiot, ‘All Things’…whenever I saw him, he used to
put on such stupid airs. I would’ve wiped that idiot out out long
ago, if he didn’t have so many subordinates or that pack of utterly
unbreakable Envoys. I didn’t have the chance to personally see him
die, but whenever I see you, his former treasure-spirit, I feel happy
all the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven continued to chortle merrily, seemingly not bothered in
the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been enslaved by
the Seamless Gate, becoming the personal retainer of the Lord of All
Fiends. Why would he be bothered by a bit of jesting from the great
Godfiend?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You used to be the
treasure-spirit for the Blackheaven Cauldron. That idiot had to have
used the Blackheaven Cauldron to create the cores of those golems,
yes? And you ended up learning those techniques…but now, you’ve
been enslaved by the Seamless Gate. What’s the point? I think it’d
be better for you if you joined me instead,” the alien Outsider
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven said in a very uncaring manner, “It doesn’t
really matter to me. If you can defeat my master, the Lord of All
Fiends, I’d be more than willing to join you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Lord of All
Fiends?” The alien Outsider frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms really
was a place that could give birth to monsters. One of these
primitives, Nuwa, had actually been able to force her way into
becoming a World God. This was quite a monstrous accomplishment. And
the Lord of All Fiends…he had actually been able to flee with a
group of experts while being pursued and attacked by a World God. The
World God, Nuwa, hadn’t even been able to catch up to him. This was
an even more monstrous accomplishment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that World Gods all completely surpassed the limitations of the
Heavenly Daos in every way, be it speed or power or other areas. But
Nuwa had still been unable to catch up to the Lord of All Fiends!
Most likely, the experts of the Three Realms didn’t truly
understand what a terrifying accomplishment this was. Mighty Godfiend
Witherspike, however, had wandered the endless primordial chaos for
many years. He understood quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Advancing to become a
World God represented a fundamental change in every single aspect.
The difference between an Elder God and a World God was simply
unfathomably vast. To make it so that even a World God couldn’t
catch up…it meant that the Lord of All Fiend’s insights into the
Dao must have reached an even more unfathomable level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms was
now divided up into two major alliances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance…when
Mother Nuwa left, she must have left some treasures and techniques
behind for them. These things made this alien Outsider quite nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate…the
person who worried him the most was the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was wary of both
sides, which was why he had never tried to attack the Three Realms.
In fact, he had chosen to ally with the Seamless Gate instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, enough of
that.” The alien Outsider pointed towards the constantly looping
images in midair. “See for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did
Blackheaven turn his head to take a look, and when he did his face
completely changed. That flashing black serpent of lightning, that
white-robed youth who attempted to perform a soulscour…wasn’t
that Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Blackheaven no longer had any trace of a smile on his face. Instead,
it was ashen. “The [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]? His true body
isn’t dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, you noticed?”
The alien Outsider chuckled. “Didn’t the Seamless Gate claim that
Ji Ning’s true body was destroyed? And if I recall correctly, I
think the Lord of All Fiends, Daomother Devilhand, and quite a few
others joined forces to ensure it…but now, he’s reappeared in the
Darkstill world, seemingly with his true body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven stared at the continuously looping images in the air. He
forced down the rage and hatred he felt, then growled out, “Great
Godfiend Witherspike, this was indeed our Seamless Gate’s mistake.
I’ve already reported this to my superiors…and I trust that
Master will soon deliver an order to me.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Blackheaven
had many golem bodies that he could use. He was able to immediately
send a message to the Lord of All Fiends, and the news was then
quickly spread to Daomother Devilhand, the Godking, and the other
high-level members of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He’s not
dead?” The black-robed Godking was the most stunned of them all. He
simply couldn’t accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some sort of clone
technique?” Keeper Everwood had been using a knife to whittle away
at a piece of wood. When he heard the news, he frowned and began to
mumble to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
Primordial Ruinworld, inside that vast castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven said respectfully, “My Master said that this Ji Ning is
a scourge. He hopes that when you deal with Tathagata and Fuxi, great
Godfiend Witherspike, you will also deal with this Ji Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The alien
Outsider chuckled. “But now, it seems, this Ji Ning has a special
cloning technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven said
hurriedly, “Even if he does, each time he restores his body he most
assuredly has to pay an enormous price. Last time, when we destroyed
his true body, Houyi ended up taking away his black lightning serpent
as well as his other treasures. This time, if you can kill him, he’ll
lose all of those things. Without them, he will be dramatically
weakened even if he does manage to rebuild his body once more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that I
have the feeling that you particularly want Ji Ning to be killed?”
The alien Outsider looked at Blackheaven, then let out a merry
chuckle. “Blackheaven, how about this? If I kill him for you, why
don’t you teach me the technique for creating Envoys?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My old master made
me swear a lifeblood oath long ago to teach it to no others,”
Blackheaven said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a
treasure-spirit, much like the giant yellow bear of the Starseizing
Manor. He had long ago trained to the level of being able to live
independently from the treasure which had housed him, and could be
considered a true living creature now. Strictly speaking, he had
actually learned the art of golems before the Lord of All Things did.
The Lord of All Things had been lucky enough to acquire the
Blackheaven Cauldron, which was why he also gained access to the
ancient golem crafting arts contained within it. This caused his
power to instantly skyrocket, resulting in him being an extremely
famous figure even amongst Elder Gods. But alas, he had fallen during
his campaign against the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that man.”
The alien Outsider said coldly, “Tell your current master that Ji
Ning has quite possibly reached the fifth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage of
swordforce? How is that even possible? He’s only trained for a few
centuries!” Blackheaven was visibly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mastery of the
[Five Treasures] could be ascribed to his peerless talent, but to
reach the fifth stage of swordforce one had to have significant
insights into the essence of the sword itself. This was something
that required time, as well as many life-and-death battles against
powerful experts. Only after seeing enough sword-arts and gaining
enough experience would one even have a chance of reaching the fifth
stage of swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s attacked my
Primordial Ruinworld, so I really should kill him. However, I’m
also doing the Seamless Gate’s dirty work for them. We have borne
all the casualties in the battles to date. We agreed on a price for
me to deal with Tathagata and Fuxi, but if you want me to deal with
Ji Ning…I’ll need twelve chaos jewels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve?” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven hesitated momentarily. The energy source for
each Envoy consisted of five chaos jewels, which allowed them to be
able to fight for a very long period of time. The other nine Envoys
probably would consume less than a hundred chaos jewels during the
entire Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has
responded. If Ji Ning truly has reached the fifth stage of
swordforce, he will deliver twelve chaos jewels after you slay his
true body,” Blackheaven said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. It’s always
a pleasure doing business with Allfiend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alien Outisder
looked downwards at Thearch Darkstill. “Darkstill, send your
surbordinates to try and kill Ji Ning. If they cannot, make sure they
at least verify whether or not he has reached the fifth stage of
swordforce. Then move to guide him into a danger zone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, almighty
Master,” Thearch Darkstill said respectfully, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” In private,
Thearch Darkstill now had an ugly look on his face. He had once been
an important general of the Lord of All Things. Later, he had become
one of the four mighty Thearchs that dominated the Primordial
Ruinworld. He had the power of an elite Daofather! He wasn’t one
whit weaker than those six retainers of Godfiend Witherspike. The
only one he felt respect and admiration for was the one-armed man. As
for the other five? Thearch Darkstill didn’t fear them in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those retainers had
followed Godfiend Witherspike for a very long period of time, and he
held more faith in them. He was much more ruthless and brutal in the
way he treated the four Thearchs, who had only submitted to him
relatively recently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth. Ji Ning. He clearly has the power of a True God and
Daofather, but I’m still supposed to go ‘verify’ if he has
reached the fifth stage of swordforce or not.” Thearch Darkstill
frowned. “If I want to force Ji Ning to reveal his swordforce, I’ll
need to send some of my more powerful subordinates. Ugh. Whenever
there is a dangerous mission, he always has the four of us send our
subordinates.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Thearch
Darkstill understood the reason why. When mighty Godfiend Witherspike
had fled to this place, he had only arrived with those six retainers
in tow. He had no other subordinates at all, and so whenever there
was a need for cannon fodder to be sent out he would naturally choose
to send out the original inhabitants of the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large force of alien
experts were flying through the air, each of whom had the power of an
Empyrean God. There had to be nearly three hundred of the creatures
flying forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother, when
your group goes to fight against Sword Immortal Darknorth, you have
to be careful. The Thearch said that Ji Ning may very well have
reached the fifth stage of swordforce.” The two leaders of this
force looked fairly similar. Both were dressed in silver robes, and
they were mentally chatting to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although my team has
been assigned to kill Ji Ning, if he really has reached the fifth
stage of swordforce all we have to do is flee. We don’t have to
force a fight against him. If he really has reached that stage of
power…it’ll be up to your team to guide him into the Forest of
Dreams,” the taller silver-robed man sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Forest of Dreams
was an extremely bizarre part of the Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once you entered it,
you would be trapped in multiple layers of illusions. You would feel
as though you were dreaming! The illusions would come endlessly, and
even True Gods or Daofathers would find it hard to extricate
themselves. They would often be eternally trapped within the Forest
of Dreams until finally the illusions killed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most terrifying
thing was…not even the denizens of the Darkstill world could be
certain as to exactly where the Forest of Dreams was located. This
was because the Forest’s location was constantly changing. It was
entirely possible that the seemingly ordinary-looking forest in front
of you was actually the terrifying Forest of Dreams. However, since
Thearch Darkstill was in command of this entire terrifying world, he
naturally had his own ways of determining the exact location of the
Forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi. Tathagata.
Where are they?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair. Spacetime was so chaotic that even his sense of directions
had become scrambled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could no longer find
any traces of Tathagata’s passing, and in a place of such chaotic
spacetime there was no way he could even use a temporal inversion
spell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is telling me
that Lord Buddha and the others should still be in the region of the
Darkstill world. Screw it. I’ll just choose a random direction and
just keep flying forward.” Ning immediately began to fly forwards,
although he didn’t dare fly too fast for fear of running into an
enemy trap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shortly after he had
entered the Primordial Ruinworld, Ning came to understand that the
hardest part of conquering this region wasn’t defeating the alien
Outsiders here; rather, it lay in dealing with the terribly
environment! No wonder all the aliens who lived here desired to
invade the Three Realms. None of the aliens wanted to live in such
terrifying, inhospitable environments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
pulse picked up slightly. He could sense an aura approaching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming a
half-step Elder God, his soul had become far more powerful! His soul
heartforce technique had only made his senses even more acute. Even
when Daofathers moved towards Ning he would be able to sense their
approach, much less the approach of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth should be somewhere in that region up ahead.” A towering,
eight-armed Fiendgod was carefully flying forwards. This eight-armed
Fiendgod was the culmination of 199 alien Empyrean Gods joining
together in the ‘Eight-Armed Warfiend Formation’. It was one of
the formations that had been left behind by the Lord of All Fiends.
Truth be told, when Thearch Darkstill was forced to send out this
many Empyrean God subordinates, he felt quite distressed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of formation
was quite similar in nature to the Seven Planets God. However, the
Seven Planets God only needed seven Empyrean Gods to execute, while
this one was used by a total of 199 Empyrean Gods. It could unleash a
degree of power close to that of an elite True God’s. This could be
considered a ‘secret technique’, and the wielders who learned the
core parts of the formation were all forced to swear lifeblood oaths
not to teach it to any others. The person who was currently the
‘core’ of this particular formation was one of the warriors who
had followed the Lord of All Things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I see him.” The
eight-armed Fiendgod had been searching for Ning. Suddenly, he saw in
the distance a white-robed youth who was calmly standing in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve arrived.”
The white-robed youth produced a sword in his hand. “Since you’ve
come, there’s no need for you to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
eight-armed Fiendgod’s aura surged explosively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
sauntered forward lazily as though he was taking a stroll through a
courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch, all 199 of
our warriors have died in battle.” A look of grief was on the face
of a golden-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of them
escaped?” Thearch Darkstill was incredulous. He barked out, “Show
me the scenes of the battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They weren’t able
to send back any scenes in time,” the golden-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
Thearch was truly stunned now. How fast had Ji Ning killed them all,
for not a single one of them to be able to send back a scene of their
death?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, one of them
trained in a special clone technique. His other clone is currently on
assignment in a different region. I suggest ordering him to return
immediately so that he can tell us what happened when they fought
against Ji Ning,” the yellow-robed elder said hurriedly. “We have
to move quickly. If he somehow loses his clone as well, then we’ll
have no way of finding any information about that battle.”

Chapter 10 - Bugbeasts
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill
immediately gave the order for that soldier’s clone to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch, Fuyou was
stomped to death by Kuafu as he was trying to lure Kuafu away.” A
report quickly came from his subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Thearch
Darkstill’s face turned ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a number of
Empyrean Gods to die during a time of war was nothing, but this
particularly one was the only one who knew what had happened during
the fight against Ji Ning. And now…he was dead. This meant that the
199 Empyrean Gods who had died in the battle against Ji Ning had died
for nothing at all. No intelligence had been gained whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu!” Thearch
Darkstill’s face was black with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are those four
squads currently located?” Thearch Darkstill asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby golden-robed
elder immediately waved his hand, causing an image to appear in
midair. This was an enormous map of the Darkstill world. There were
four specks of light on the map, and the golden-robed elder pointed
towards one of the specks of light that was close to the edge. “This
is the squad which Kuafu is leading. Kuafu, an ancient divinity of
the Three Realms, possesses truly enormous power. I heard that when
those ten Golden Crows wreaked havoc upon the ancient Pangu
Chaosworld, Kuafu chased after them so furiously that all ten of them
were terrified by him. None of them dared to turn back and fight
against him. From our fights against Kuafu’s squad, I can say for
certain that Kuafu is indeed astonishingly powerful and is quite
close to an Elder God in strength.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Thearch
Darkstill nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi and Kuafu were
once equally famous during the Primordial Era. By now, Houyi was
publicly acknowledged to be unfathomably strong and being at least at
the overlord level of power. As for Kuafu, he was a bit weaker but
was still quite close to the overlord level of power as well, and he
was an extremely valiant warrior who was extremely skilled in combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This squad here is
the squad led by Human Sovereign Fuxi. This is the toughest squad to
deal with. Fuxi has been able to easily see through our traps and
formations, and even when he enters them he can easily break them
apart from within.” The golden-robed elder continued, “That’s
why we are temporarily focusing on the other three squads right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here.” The
golden-robed elder pointed at yet another speck of light. “This is
the squad led by the leader of the Buddhist Sangha, Tathagata. It is
just as dangerous as Fuxi’s squad is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And here. This final
squad is led by Daoist Jade Cauldron of the Daoist Path. Daoist Jade
Cauldron possessed formidable divine abilities and has reached the
fifth stage of swordforce. He definitely isn’t an easy person to
deal with either.” The golden-robed figure pointed at the final
speck of light as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill
frowned as he heard this. Two of the squads sent out by the Three
Realms were led by overlords Tathagata and Fuxi. The other two were
led by Kuafu and Daoist Jade Cauldron, who were close to the overlord
level of power as well. There were multiple elite Daofathers in their
teams, as well as a few ordinary Daofathers who knew certain special
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jade Cauldron
was a fairly low-key figure, but he was still viewed as one of the
top two figures under the command of Daoist Three Purities. He also
had an extremely famous disciple of his own, the number one general
of the Celestial Court during the Primordial Era…Erlang Shen, also
known as Yang Jian. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And where is Ji
Ning?” Thearch Darkstill asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth is here.” The golden-robed elder pointed to a corner of
the map where another speck of light had appeared. “He is closest
to Kuafu’s squad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Thearch
Darkstill nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch!” A
gray-robed subordinate charged into the room, then said frantically,
“Our clansman Floatstone’s squad attempted to lure Ji Ning into
the Forest of Dreams, but his senses were simply too keen. As soon as
the squad drew close to him, he immediately discovered them and then
killed them. There’s no way to lure him away from far away, but
whenever our people get close he kills them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill
frowned. “The terrain is to our advantage, but we still aren’t
able to lure him into the places we want him to go? Are his senses
really that keen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, he had
no idea that Ning was now a half-step Elder God. His soul was
incredibly powerful and acute!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have them stay away
from Ji Ning for now,” Thearch Darkstill instructed. “Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
subordinate hurriedly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch.” The
golden-robed elder looked towards Thearch Darkstill. “Ji Ning is
not an easy person to deal with. Even our ‘Eight-Armed Warfiend
Formation’ was effortlessly annihilated by him. He is at least as
powerful as an elite Daofather. We can tell from this alone that he
has reached the fifth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Sovereign
Thearch shook his head. “There’s many possible reasons why he was
able to destroy their formation. For example, it’s possible that
he’s broken through to become a True God. It’s also possible that
he’s travelling with allies, that he’s brought other major powers
of the Nuwa Alliance with him; it could’ve been those allies that
destroyed the formation. We can’t speculate wildly before even
seeing the records of that battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But not even the
Eight-Armed Warfiend was able to send back any information…” The
golden-robed elder felt sorrowful for their losses. “Godfiend
Witherspike is commanding many different forces to deal with
Tathagata, Fuxi, Kuafu, and Daoist Jade Cauldron, but we are forced
to deal with Ji Ning by ourselves. Far too many members of our race
have died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will go test out
Ji Ning’s skills in person.” An icy gray light flashed through
the eyes of Thearch Darkstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thearch, you must
not!” The golden-robed elder cried out hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll personally
test him out, but I’ll do it via sending my mind to directly
descend upon one of my children,” Thearch Darkstill said calmly.
“Don’t worry. I won’t risk myself without a good reason.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed elder
let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill waved
his hand. Instantly, nine mountain-sized freaks suddenly appeared in
the hall next to him. There was a stone giant, an eight-legged
beetle, a two-headed serpent…all of them had powerful auras on the
level of a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve spent
countless years in order to rear these bugbeasts and make them become
as powerful as a True God. I didn’t expect that a Sword Immortal
who has trained for less than a thousand years would be capable of
forcing me to use them.” Thearch Darkstill looked at the bugbeasts,
and then let out friendly keening calls in response. It was as though
they viewed Thearch Darkstill as their parent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were actually
quite a few techniques in the primordial chaos that were meant for
rearing bugbeasts. Strictly speaking, the [Nine Bug Solutions] which
Youngflame Freak had acquired and used was actually even more
profound than the technique which Thearch Darkstill used. However,
Youngflame Freak was just far too weak. He was only able to make use
of a tiny part of the true technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When these nine
children of mine fight against Ji Ning, I’ll send my mind and soul
with them. Whatever they experience, I’ll experience as well. I’ll
be able to get a clear sense of what Ji Ning’s skills are,”
Thearch Darkstill said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to
send out all nine bugbeasts?” The golden-robed elder felt a bit of
heartache. “Three should be enough, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Best to be cautious.
We’ve already failed once. We cannot fail again.” Thearch
Darkstill sent out his will, causing the nine bugbeasts to once more
screech in response. They then soared into the air, quickly
disappearing into the emptiness of space towards Ji Ning’s
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distorted,
scrambled spacetime in this area was of no threat to injure Ning. His
soul was so powerful that he could sense which places posed a threat
to him and which places were safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. As he flew
forward, his eyes suddenly lit up. A dazzling beautiful lake had just
appeared before him, and there was a little island in the center of
the lake which was filled with wild grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
such a beautiful place to exist within a region of such chaotic
spacetime.” Ning’s heartforce had spread out to cover an area of
tens of thousands of kilometers, and it was rippling out in waves to
scan every single inch of the region. He verified that it wasn’t a
trap, then flew straight down to the island and sat down. He pulled
out a flagon of wine, then leaned back and took a sip for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked rather
relaxed, but in truth Ning was trying to decide what his next step
should be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since I entered
the Darkstill world, I’ve been attacked by alien Outsiders every so
often. They keep on challenging me, and they are very familiar with
the local environment. They seem to know exactly where I am as well.”
Ning frowned. This was quite an uncomfortable feeling, to not know
where the enemy was but have the enemy know exactly where he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing for
it. The reason why the Three Realms had never launched an actual
assault against the Primordial Ruinworld was in large part due to how
inhospitable the environment here was. This place was very hard to
invade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Darkstill world
isn’t even that big. So long as I visit enough places, sooner or
later I’ll sense some energy ripples and be able to locate one of
the other four squads.” Ning suddenly frowned and turned to look
towards the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And there as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards all
eight directions from his position on the island. He could sense
multiple auras approaching at high speed from different directions.
He hurriedly rose to his feet, producing a Darknorth sword in his
hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grwaaaar!”
Accompanied by a growl, an azure beetle that had a pair of wings on
its back suddenly appeared from a distorted region of spacetime that
was more than ten thousand kilometers away. Its golden eyes stared
fixedly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hissssss.” A
giant, two-headed black serpent emerged from another part of the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bugbeast after
another appeared, each of which had the aura of a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured softly to
himself, “Bugbeasts?” Ning had learned multiple bugbeast-rearing
techniques, both from stone steles of the prisonworld as well as from
the techniques passed down by World God Northrest. There were many
major powers in the primordial chaos who trained in these types of
techniques. This was because major powers tended to live for a very
long period of time. When they reached a bottleneck and were unable
to grow stronger, they would divert a bit of their attention towards
rearing powerful bugbeasts. These bugbeasts would be absolutely loyal
and devoted towards them, and there was no chance of betrayal at all.
They could be used to scout dangerous areas, or even block a critical
blow meant for their master. There were many, many uses for such
creatures.

Chapter 11 - Sword Peacock
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you were lucky, you
might end up rearing a bugbeast that was even more powerful than you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bugbeasts possessed low
levels of intelligence, and they were far inferior to cultivators in
terms of their insights into the Dao. However, this was precisely why
it was fairly easy to upgrade them. Their most powerful weapons were
their massive, powerful bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grwaaaaar!” The
nine bugbeasts were attacking from nine different directions. They
were tens of thousands of kilometers away from Ji Ning, and they all
shrieked, roared, and screeched as they stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood atop the
island. He swept them with his gaze, then chuckled loudly. “I
wonder which ‘major power’ is so terrified that he doesn’t dare
to come in person and instead sends a few bugs over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill,
whose mind and soul was riding with these nine bugbeasts, became
rather angry upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My children are more
than enough to kill you.” The bugbeast shaped like a stone giant
roared angrily. Deep under the cracked parts of its stony exterior,
flesh and blood could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Is that so?”
Ning made his move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! A black
lightning serpent flashed through the skies. A distance of just ten
or twenty thousand kilometers was no distance at all to Ning; for
him, travelling such a distance was as easy as taking a single step
was for an ordinary mortal. He immediately appeared before the stone
giant, and as he arrived an icy-cold streak of sword-light descended
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.” The
stone giant brandished his enormous club-like hands, smashing at Ning
with them and completely ignoring Ning’s attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The other
eight bugbeasts flew towards him as well. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick. Snick. Snick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light flashed
back to Ning’s side. Ning stood there calmly in front of the stone
giant. The stone giant’s fists were just about to land upon Ning,
but suddenly it froze. It stood there blankly for a moment, and
then…its neck, chest, and flank all split apart. Its body was
chopped apart into four evenly sized pieces, and the four pieces all
began to fall downwards. Ning’s sword-light had completely snuffed
out the stone giant’s life. In fact, Ning didn’t even use the
rainbow-colored swordforce; against a foe of this level, there was no
need to use it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He’s this
powerful, even without using any swordforce at all? This sword-art
definitely is something that only an expert who has mastered
fifth-stage swordforce can come up with. There’s no mistaking it.”
Thearch Darkstill instantly became certain of this. Ji Ning hadn’t
used rainbow-colored swordforce, but this was precisely why he was
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” The eight
bugbeasts that had been charging towards Ning hurriedly began to
scatter every which way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to run?”
Ning’s gaze turned cold. Although he possessed the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique, these eight bugbeasts were all fleeing
in a different direction, and they would soon disappear into a field
of chaotic spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
pointed a finger up towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies suddenly
turned dark. Streaks of of rainbow-colored sword-light began to
manifest in the area, and in just an instant the entire region seemed
to have transformed into a world of rainbow-colored swordlight. This
was a world of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight bugbeasts
stared as the heavens and the earth around them suddenly transformed
into a world of rainbow-colored sword-light. All of them were
terrified. Thearch Darkstill, whose spirit was riding with them,
immediately urged them to flee! Thearch Darkstill had already guessed
that Ji Ning had reached the fifth stage of swordforce, which was why
he wasn’t surprised at all. “Hmph. So what if he can manifest a
world of the sword? This is a large-scale technique, yes, but that
means that the technique will be fairly weak. Every single streak of
sword-light is quite feeble; there’s no way it will be able to harm
my children.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Peacock!”
Ning murmured these words softly, but his voice was like the voice of
Heaven and Earth. When he spoke, his words resonated throughout this
region as though an edict had just been proclaimed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The brilliant
rainbow-colored swordlight filling the area instantly began to merge
together, forming a sight that looked like flower buds blooming or
like a peacock displaying its feathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light
radiated an arcane intent as it swept forward, and the countless
streaks of rainbow sword-light solidified into a total of 1001
peacock feathers, so dazzling and beautiful that one couldn’t help
but feel intoxicated by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight fleeing
bugbeasts didn’t have any chance to escape at all. The terrifying
sword-light passed right through them…and then their bodies
completely crumbled apart, all life extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All nine of the
bugbeasts had been slain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven
sword-stances of [Sword-Heaven-Earth] truly are extraordinarily
powerful.” Ning nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique was not
a technique he had created himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own original
creation was the [Brightmoon] sword-art, a sword-art which was meant
for battling against foes in close combat. All of its techniques,
including ‘Heavenbreaker’, ‘Blood Drop’, and ‘Shadowless’
were meant for dueling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven sword-stances
of [Sword-Heaven-Earth], however, were techniques that were meant for
massacring weaker foes on a vast scale. They involved using a large
amount of swordforce in order to massacre the enemies! This sort of
technique was extremely effective against numerous weaker foes, but
it was much less effective against someone who was comparable in
strength to you. For that situation, the [Brightmoon] sword-art was
still better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, sufficiently
large quantities of cannon fodder could have an impact on the overall
flow of a battle. Using a sword-art like [Sword-Heaven-Earth] against
them could be quite effective. Ning had no desire to come up with
such a butcher’s technique on his own, but he had discovered
[Sword-Heaven-Earth] amongst the ninety-eight sword techniques
inscribed on those stone steles left behind by World God Northrest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, Ning used the
second stance of [Sword-Heaven-Earth], ‘Sword Peacock’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather-level
bugbeasts like them…” Ning shook his head, then took a single
step forward and flew into the skies. He once more disappeared into
space, advancing forward in the hopes of joining together with the
other squads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancestral grounds
of the Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
sword-art.” Thearch Darkstill was still engrossed in pondering the
dazzling sword-art he had just seen, the one which had looked like a
peacock spreading its feathers. He was an elite Daofather, after all,
and so he was able to see exactly how terrifying that beautiful
sword-art was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even when Daofathers used magic treasures, they had to send
those magic treasures flying off into the distance to assault their
foes. This sword-art, however, used rainbow-colored swordforce as its
underlying power source. With a thought, the wielder was able to fill
an extremely wide swathe of land with the swordforce while
maintaining a terrifying level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dazzling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shockingly sharp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill was
completely stunned. “When I followed the Lord of All Things, I went
to quite a few places within the primordial chaos…but this is the
first time I’ve ever seen such a dazzling, beautiful sword-art.
This sword-art alone is profound enough to be proclaimed the number
one sword-art of the Three Realms. Terrifying. This sword-art is
utterly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, he had no
idea that this was something which World God Northrest, someone who
stood at the very peak of power amongst World Gods, had come up with
after meditating on the nameless sword-art he had acquired. Even
other World Gods would be amazed by this technique, to say nothing of
a mere True God such as Thearch Darkstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be easy
to deceive an expert like this. To lure him into the Forest of Dreams
will be far too difficult. In addition…the Forest might not be able
to hold him.” Thearch Darkstill had personally witnessed that last
sword-art, after all. He now had a much higher opinion of Ji Ning
than before. In his heart, Ji Ning was now considered an even more
terrifying figure than Daoist Jade Cauldron.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he have
come up with a sword-art like this?” Thearch Darkstill couldn’t
help but ask himself this question. “Well…I need to go see
Godfiend Witherspike right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
Primordial Ruinworld. Within the dark golden castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Witherspike remained
seated atop his throne, relaxing as he stared at four different
scenes that were playing out in the air before him. These scenes were
of Kuafu, Daoist Jade Cauldron, Tathagata, and Fuxi as they fought in
combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance
really is powerful…and this should just be part of their total
strength.” He couldn’t help but let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bulk of their
forces remain in the Three Realm, unwilling to leave their
headquarters. If they did, our Seamless Gate would absolutely wreck
their worlds and their headquarters.” Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven let out a chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who is
skilled in formations is a monster as far as I am concerned. This
Fuxi fellow, and that Keeper Everwood of your Seamless Gate…ugh. I
really don’t understand. How did they end up developing such
troublesome and complicated formations?” The alien Outsider
couldn’t help but let out another sigh. “I don’t have any
interest in developing formations myself. Personal power is what
matters the most, as far as I am concerned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almighty Master.”
A voice rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alien Outsider was
startled, but Celestial Immortal Blackheaven let out a laugh.
“Thearch Darkstill has arrived. It seems we are going to hear some
good news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darkstill is quite
reliable when taking on missions.” The alien Outsider glanced
calmly towards the outside. Soon, Thearch Darkstill arrived before
him, hurriedly falling to his knees with respect. “Master, as you
ordered I did my best to either slay Ji Ning or lure him into the
Forest of Dreams. However…Ji Ning is simply far too powerful. Your
subordinate is truly incapable of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too powerful?” The
nearby Celestial Immortal Blackheaven frowned. “He’s a young
fellow who has trained for less than a thousand years. How powerful
could he possibly be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate
sent the ‘Eight-Armed Warfiend Formation’ to deal with Ji Ning,
but all 199 Empyrean Gods of the formation perished in battle without
even being able to send any information back,” Thearch Darkstill
said. “Ji Ning is extremely cautious. There’s no way for any of
my minions to get close to him or to lure him anywhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated alien
Outsider frowned. “Has he reached the fifth stage of swordforce?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, your
subordinate sent nine bugbeasts to deal with Ji Ning. Would you like
to see the results of that battle?” Thearch Darkstill asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The alien
Outsider nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill
immediately pointed towards the empty air next to him. Scenes of the
battle instantly appeared and began to play in empty air. This was
what Thearch Darkstill had personally witnessed just now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire hall was
completely silent. Everyone was focused on the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine bugbeasts
appeared. Ji Ning rose to his feet and drew his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword struck out,
and a bugbeast was split apart into four pieces. The alien Outsider
nodded and pronounced his judgment. “This sword-art is indeed proof
that he has reached the fifth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight bugbeasts
began to flee in different directions. Ji Ning pointed towards the
heavens, causing a boundless amount of swordforce to descend and
forming an entire world of swordforce. Then, he used a horrifying
sword-art to massacre the bugbeasts…‘Sword Peacock’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a peacock
spreading its feathers. It was a dazzlingly beautiful scene, and one
which caused all the powerful figures in the hall to turn completely
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a long moment
later did the seated alien Outsider let out a soft sigh. “How
beautiful. What a beautiful sword. It has been a long time since I’ve
seen such a beautiful sword-art. The last time I did see such a
sword-art was when I was at the city of Hillfall, where I saw distant
Chaos Immortals battling in the sky. That was the only time I’ve
ever seen such beautiful sword-arts. He truly is the number one Sword
Immortal of your Three Realms. This reputation…it is completely
deserved!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the figures present
nodded. This sword-art was a technique for committing butchery, but
it was also an intoxicatingly beautiful technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be this
powerful? How did he become even more powerful than he was back when
he was in the Deerchaser world?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
found this all quite hard to accept. “Back then, he still had to
rely on the Envoy. Now, all by himself and when using just a single
sword, he is able to unleash such tremendous power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I have
something to report.” Thearch Darkstill’s face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
alien Outsider frowned. He had been entranced by the beauty of that
sword-art; naturally, he was quite unhappy to be roused from his
reverie.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Darkstill said
hurriedly, “After Ji Ning slew my nine bugbeasts, he continued to
advance. He’s now sensed ripples emanating from a battle which
Kuafu’s squad is engaged in. He’s moving towards Kuafu’s squad
at high speed and is going to join with them soon.”

Chapter 12 - Joining Together
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s about to join
together with Kuafu’s squad?” The alien Outsider drummed on the
throne’s armrest with his fingers, then smiled as he looked at
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven. “Blackheaven, Ji Ning truly is the
undisputed number one Sword Immortal of the Three Realms. This
sword-art alone ensures that there’s no way those useless minions
of mine can deal with him. Even by himself, he’s very hard to deal
with. Once he joins together with Kuafu, it’ll be even harder to
deal with him. There’s nothing I can do. If the Seamless Gate
wishes to stop him, I suggest you hurry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven said
hurriedly, “The strategy we agreed upon with you, Godfiend, was
that we would make use of the inhospital environment of the
Primordial Ruinworld to kill as many of the True Gods and Daofathers
of the Three Realms as possible. It isn’t time for the Seamless
Gate to attack yet. Once we do, the Endwar shall immediately begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Then we are
out of options,” the alien Outsider said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms.
Within a palace in the Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixteen True Gods and
Daofathers were here, including the Lord of All Fiends, Keeper
Everwood, Daomother Devilhand, the black-robed Godking, Daofather
Netherjade, and others. Some had sent their true bodies, with others
manifesting incarnations. The weakest figure present was still an
elite Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A voice
rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven. Come
in,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven entered, then said respectfully, “We just received a
new intelligence report from the Primordial Ruinworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated True Gods
and Daofathers all looked towards Blackheaven. The Lord of All Fiends
said, “Speak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, please take
a look.” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven pointed towards an empty
space nearby. Instantly, scenes of a battle began to be displayed. It
was the battle between Ji Ning and those nine bugbeasts. After
watching the scene, Blackheaven was naturally able to reproduce it
for the benefit of others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s fighting
against nine bugbeasts. From the looks of them, those bugbeasts
should be quite powerful, at the level of True Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers were
paying close to attention to this fight. When they saw Ning easily
slay a bugbeast with just a single sword-strike, they simply frowned.
But when ‘Sword Peacock’ was displayed, all the major powers in
the hall were stunned. In fact, looks of absolute rapture could be
seen in the eyes of Daomother Devilhand and a few other Daofathers as
she saw the beautiful technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
sword-art.” Daomother Devilhand let out a soft sigh. “It really
is beautiful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
sword-art.” Keeper Everwood nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just a
area-of-effect sword-art Ji Ning uses to attack a host of weaker
foes. His close-combat skills are undoubtedly even more terrifying.
He was able to easily kill that bugbeast without even using his
rainbow swordforce; this means that strike just revealed a tiny
portion of his true power.” The Lord of All Fiend became even more
solemn. “Sword Immortal Darknorth of the Nuwa Alliance has now
become one of our major foes. He’s no weaker than Daofather Fuju
was!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s trained for a
shorter period of time than Daofather Fuju had,” Keeper Everwood
said. “He’s trained for less than a thousand years, but has
reached such a level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The efforts of our
‘Godking’ really were quite indispensable in helping Ji Ning to
train so quickly,” Daomother Devilhand said mockingly as she
glanced sideways at the ashen-faced Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
was filled with sullen resentment. When he saw that lovely
sword-strike, even he felt uncontrollably mesmerized by it. It was
simply too beautiful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next moment,
however, he remember that the person who had displayed that
sword-strike was Ji Ning. Ji Ning was once a minor figure who he held
in complete contempt, so much so that the Godking didn’t even care
that much about using Yu Wei as a chess piece. Who would’ve thought
that this minor figure would have become even more powerful than him!
Although he didn’t want to admit it, he knew quite well that Ji
Ning no longer needed to use any formations to fight with him. That
sword-strike alone was proof that Ji Ning had vastly surpassed him.
This sword-art alone ensured that Ji Ning was very close to the
overlord level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one could’ve
imagined that Ji Ning would advance so rapidly. The actions the
Godking took against him, such as the destruction of Yu Wei’s
soul…normally speaking, those actions should’ve cast a shadow
over his heart and perhaps even thrown him into an eternal stupor,
never to advance any further. The Godking’s actions weren’t
wrong. Ji Ning…Ji Ning is simply too much of a monster,”
Daofather Augur said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A shadow over his
heart?” Daomother Devilhand shook her head. “I heard that during
the Crimsonbright Realmwar, this dear Godking of ours tried to force
Ji Ning to choose to join us. Instead, he broke through to the fourth
stage of heartforce in the blink of an eye. This time, our Godking
went straight to killing Yu Wei’s soul…and in yet another blink
of an eye, Ji Ning’s nearly become an overlord-class figure. Last
time in the Deerchaser world, Ji Ning had to rely on the Rahu
Formation and his Envoy in order to reach this level of power. This
time, he no longer has to rely on any external sources of help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.”
Daomother Devilhand turned and smiled at him. “Some people are
irrepressible. You simply can’t beat them down. The more you
pressure you place upon them, the more dazzling their performance
shall be. Ji Ning is one such person.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
lesson, aunt-master.” The black-robed Godking bowed towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has already
turned into a serious problem for us.” The Lord of All Fiends
looked at the others, then instructed, “Blackheaven, keep a close
eye on him in the Primordial Ruinworld. If you can find a chance to
kill him there, do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld. The Darkstill world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A titanic foot that was
tens of thousands of kilometers in size pierced through the skies,
slamming downwards towards the land. Mountains and rivers alike were
completely crushed and flattened by this foot as an enormous
footprint was gouged into the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant foot then
quickly shrank in size, and a bare-chested, muscular man who was
dressed in a fur loincloth appeared. The laughed loudly, “Ahaha,
these dogshit formations sure are a pain in the ass. They seem so
mysterious and profound, but when I put my foot down even the earth
itself is blasted apart. Doesn’t that wreck those formations
perfectly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ones you can
destroy are all the weaker ones.” A golden-robed woman with
draconic horns on her head laughed as she walked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was a bit
anticlimactic. I wanted to spend a bit more time studying the
mysteries of this formation.” A handsome, silver-haired,
fan-wielding youth shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu took advantage
of the fact that he runs faster than me. Otherwise, I would’ve
split that formation apart with a blow of my axe.” A massive
headless Fiendgod walked next to them as well. This headless Fiendgod
was bare-chested as well, but he had eyes where his nipples should
have been and a mouth where his belly button should have been. His
belly-mouth was speaking rather unhappily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xingtian, I didn’t
‘run’ per se. I just stretched my leg out and stepped on that
dogshit formation.” The muscular man holding a wooden staff in his
hands was Kuafu. Kuafu laughed smugly, and he even twiddled his toes
a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Fiendgods
chatted and joked amongst themselves as they continued to cause
destruction. Deadly formations? Screw’m. They’d first give them a
chop of the axe or a good hard stomping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the six of them
worked together, their actions were straightforward and brutal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The handsome,
fan-wielding youth’s face changed slightly as he turned to look off
into the distance. “Something’s happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five
Fiendgods, upon hearing his words, all grew careful as they turned
over as well. They knew very well that although their good friend
‘Windfate’ was an ordinary Daofather, his senses were incredibly
acute. He could use the wind to sense many things which others could
not sense. In fact, he was also very skilled at scrying on the
workings of fate itself, which was why he was known as Daofather
Windfate. In this squad, he was the best detector of danger; without
him, these brutish figures would’ve easily been drawn into
dangerous, trap-filled regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A black
lightning serpent was flying towards them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent?” Upon seeing the black serpent, all of them relaxed
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Sword
Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning.” Xingtian laughed. “The only person
who can use this [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique in the Three
Realms should be Ji Ning. But…it’s a bit odd. Wasn’t his true
body destroyed by the Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti
told me that Ji Ning would come, but I didn’t expect him to come
using the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent],” a soft, gentle-looking
maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s figure
appeared in midair above them, then began to descend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Fiendgods
walked towards him in a very friendly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you,” Ning said hurriedly. He had something of a friendship with
Xingtian the Heaven Punisher long ago, thanks to the latter
permitting him to use the ‘Heaven Punisher Formation’. As for the
other five, he had met four of them before. It was back when Exalted
Celestial Thundergod and some other major powers had sought to learn
the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique from him; back then, a
large group of major powers had congregated around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Xingtian
laughed. “Ji Ning, let me make the introductions. This fellow here
is Kuafu, a barbarian who has warts for brains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You make it sound
like you are very refined and gentile,” Kuafu said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu actually knows
the word ‘gentile’? How unexpected.” The fan-wielding Daofather
Windfate chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Subhuti
told me that you’d be coming. Not bad, not bad…it seems your true
body is in perfect shape.” Kuafu reached out with his hand and
patted Ning on the shoulders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xingtian continued with
the introductions. “This is Daofather Windfate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Windfate
folded his fan, then nodded and smiled at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Empress Xi.”
Kuafu pointed at the dragon-horned woman dressed in golden robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Empress Xi
was also a Fiendgod. She was actually the grand-daughter of the
Ancestor Dragon. The Ancestor Dragon had nine sons. One of them, the
Bi’an Tiger, had a daughter who he named Xi. No one expected that
Xi would actually prove to be even more formidable than her father,
and she eventually became an elite Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Luwu.”
Xingtian pointed at the honest-looking man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God Luwu.”
Ning greeted him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luwu smiled. He looked
like the honest, straightforward man he was. He had become an
Empyrean God long ago, and he had served as a guard for quite a few
different major powers. In fact, he had once been a guard and general
for the Celestial Emperor which Xingtian had slain. When Xingtian had
assaulted the Celestial Court, Luwu had attempted to stop him, only
to fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that great
battle, Xingtian had finally made his breakthrough to become a True
God. A few years later, however, the low-key Luwu had also silently,
soundlessly broken through to become a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Graceful
Peacock.” Xingtian pointed at the gentle-looking maiden. “She has
four clones, and one of them is in each squad. This makes it easier
for our squads to communicate with each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
Daomother Graceful Peacock,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graceful Peacock had an
extremely formidable elder brother, Mahamayuri of the Buddhist
Sangha. During the Primordial Era, he had become a figure who was
close to the overlord level of power. His savage reputation was known
throughout the Primordial Era, but in this day and age he rarely
showed himself. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Graceful Peacock
and Mahamayuri were the children of the deceased Elder God known as
the ‘Phoenix’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Graceful
Peacock was merely an ordinary Daomother, she had been able to
cultivate her five peacock feathers into five separate clones, each
of which had bodies like top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures that
were completely unbreakable. She usually sent those clones out to
adventure, while her true body was kept safe in the legendary Phoenix
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve sent a total
of four squads to destroy the Primordial Ruinworlds,” Kuafu said
with a loud laugh. “Our squad completely consists of Fiendgods -
Myself, Empress Xi, Windfate, Graceful Peacock, and Luwu. Lord
Tathagata the Buddha is commanding a squad that is completely
composed of Buddhas of the Buddhist Sangha; their squad has four
total! Fuxi’s squad also has four members, each of whom is a major
power of the human race. The final squad is led by Daoist Jade
Cauldron, which consists of seven True Gods and Daofathers of the
Daoist Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you’ve
joined us…hm. We’ve already decided upon a joint combination
formation that we are using. I’m not exactly sure how we should
work you into it.” Kuafu pondered on this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Daofather squads
all came equipped with formations, so as to be able to unleash
tremendous power in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this?”
Xingtian said. “Ji Ning, just follow us. If you encounter anything
dangerous, just stay inside our formation for now. We don’t have
enough time to alter the formation for you right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Xingtian and
Kuafu were speaking in quite a delicate, tactful manner. Because all
six of them were True Gods, when they unleashed their formation they
were able to do in a very perfect manner. But now, Ji Ning had
suddenly appeared. As they saw it, he was just an Empyrean God. He
might have some special techniques, but if everyone else in the
formation had True God divine power while Ning only had Empyrean God
divine power, an imbalance would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had his own
concerns as well. Xingtian and the others all had True God power,
while he himself was a half-step Elder God. His divine power was even
purer than theirs. If he joined their formation, it truly would cause
an imbalance. It probably was indeed better for him to act
independently for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful and stay
close to us. The Primordial Ruinworld isn’t easy to deal with,”
Kuafu advised. He actually cared quite deeply about Ji Ning, as Ji
Ning had rendered tremendous merits to the Nuwa Alliance. However,
Kuafu was quite puzzled as well…why had Ji Ning even come? Didn’t
he know that he would just be slowing them down? Still, this question
really wasn’t very appropriate to actually voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t cause any
trouble.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s
head out.” Kuafu gave the order, and the group of seven began to
advance once more, smashing through all impediments that sought to
bar their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. Mahamayuri is also
known as the Peacock Wisdom King, and is often shown as being or
riding a peacock.  ↩

Chapter 13 - A Dangerous Zone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The squad
continued to fly forwards, smashing through all obstacles. Even if
they did encounter any problems, Kuafu would stretch out his massive
leg across tens of thousands of kilometers and flatten anything in
front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning had been
travelling alone, he had suffered occasional attacks from the likes
of the nine bugbeasts and the Fiendgod formation, but now that he was
alongside Kuafu and the rest of the True Gods things were much
simpler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does this feel
easy?” Xingtian and Ning were flying shoulder-to-shoulder atop a
cloud, and he smiled as he asked Ning this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at
Xingtian’s belly-mouth. He was quite calm; he himself had once
commanded a Heaven Punisher Formation before, after all. Laughing,
Ning replied, “Yes. I haven’t even had a chance to fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu is the fastest
person here. None of us can overtake him.” Xingtian chuckled. “And
you should know that the alien Outsiders of the Primordial Ruinworld
are weaker than the experts of the Three Realms to begin with. This
is why they simply don’t dare to fight against us head-on when we
attack. Their only recourse is to use some of the more dangerous
features of the local terrain to deal with us. The Darkstill world,
however, is one of the top-ranked worlds of the Primordial Ruinworld.
Worlds like the Darkstill world that were taken over by powerful
races are actually the least dangerous worlds of all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It made
sense. The powerful races would want to take over the best places to
live. The truly deadly places weren’t suitable for life to
flourish. The Three Realms, for example, was a wonderful place to
live, but it had been taken over by the Nuwa Alliance and the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why we can
be fairly relaxed here at the Darkstill world. Once we reach some
truly dangerous worlds, however, things will become much tenser.”
Xingtian instructed, “When the time comes, you’ll need to be very
careful. There are some extremely dangerous regions which will spell
guaranteed doom for even overlord-class Daofathers who are trapped
within them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
replied solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very true that
there were some places which would spell certain doom for even
overlords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld had ten famous danger zones, and the ‘Voidsea’ was
ranked first and foremost amongst the ten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘waters’ of the
Voidsea consisted of countless shattered pieces of voidspace. The
pieces of voidspace all clashed against each other, generating
terrifying levels of destructive power. Even top-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures would be ground to dust by them! Only Chaos
treasures would withstand their destructive force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To this day, no one had
ever dared to enter the Voidsea and face that terrifying destructive
force. Not even Mother Nuwa had ever given it a try. Perhaps she
gained the power to survive it after becoming a World God, but why
would she be willing to take on such an unnecessary risk?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The squad continued to
advance. Two days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
downwards. There was an enormous city of buildings beneath them.
There were even some dazzlingly beautiful palaces amongst the strange
alien edifices, but all of them were in wretched condition. Many of
those buildings had clearly been chopped or blasted apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu glanced
downwards, then let out a loud laugh. “Judging from those
sword-scars, Daoist Jade Cauldron must have come here. He’s quite
fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was indeed Daoist
Jade Cauldron’s squad which destroyed this ancestral homeland of
the Darkstill race,” Graceful Peacock said. One of her clones was
in each squad, and so she knew exactly what was going on where.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ancestral
homeland of the Darkstill race…” Ning couldn’t help but
secretly sigh. This was a war for survival. For the sake of the Nuwa
Alliance’s survival, their only options were to force their enemies
to flee, to surrender…or to be completely wiped out. There were no
other options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. We’ve spent
five days here at the Darkstill world and have completely scoured it
clean. Time to go to the next world,” Kuafu said. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and the others immediately continued on their journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This journey was quite
an uneventful one. Even when they did encounter some minor problems,
Kuafu and the others would deal with them. There was no need for Ning
to intervene at all, and Ning was in no rush to do so. He had come to
the Primordial Ruinworld to help fight and help them win. When they
truly needed him, he would make his move. In fact, if they could win
the entire war without him revealing his true power, that would be
even better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had always been
quite calm. Now that he had reached the overlord level of power, he
had become even calmer and more self-assured than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those words I heard
in the past were true. Only when one has become truly powerful does
one have the right to be relaxed and self-assured in dealing with all
things,” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms.
Allclans Palace, the imperial palace of the Primordial Imperial Clan,
also known as the imperial palace of the Yu the Great’s clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, the human clans had summoned all of their major powers to come
here. When the human clans had reached the true zenith of their
power, they had been the rulers of the entire Primordial World. Many
Fiendgods such as Xingtian or the Raindragon had long ago opted to
stand alongside the human race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the palace were
the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism,
Patriarch Subhuti, great divinity Houyi, various elite Daofathers of
the Daoist Path and Buddhist Sangha, and a number of unaffiliated
Daofathers. They had gathered here more than half a year ago. Ever
since the war against the Primordial Ruinworld had started, they had
gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, most
only sent incarnations or clones! The reason they were gathered here
was to ensure that they could all mobilize together at a moment’s
notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi’s squad has
already entered the extremely dangerous ‘Thousand Mountains’
world,” Suiren said. “This is the most dangerous world they have
encountered since they launched their assault against the Primordial
Ruinworld!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those alien
Outsiders are quite crafty.” Daoist Three Purities nodded. “They’ve
been unwilling to fight head-on, and we haven’t been able to find
any of their true headquarters. We’ve already finished destroying
the easy targets, those safer worlds. Now, our only option is to
assault the extremely dangerous ones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it!”
Suddenly, a muscular, black-armored figure seated below him boomed
out in a deep voice. “Ji Ning’s sudden addition to the strike
team of Daofathers is going to be a problem. Things were fine in the
first few months because they were only dealing with the safe worlds;
in fact, he didn’t even need to help out, as my old brother Kuafu
and the others dealt with everything! But now they are entering the
Thousand Mountains world, and that is a dangerous place indeed. When
something dangerous happens, Kuafu and the others might not even be
able to protect themselves, to say nothing of Ji Ning. When that
happens, Ji Ning will end up slowing them down and exposing them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I dislike
Thundergod’s personality,” a skinny old man with an extraordinary
demeanor said, “His words aren’t unreasonable. We sent out those
squads after careful discussion, and every member of the squad can
join together into a combination formation. But with Ji Ning thrown
into the mix…no matter which squad he joins, he won’t be able to
work with their combination formations. At this point in time, he
really could easily become a burden to them. I’m worried that he’s
going to make things harder for Kuafu and Xingtian’s team.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers seated
below all began to speak their thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few months ago, when
Ji Ning had first entered the Primordial Ruinworld, they had
discussed this matter. However, things weren’t quite so dangerous
back then as the squads hadn’t encountered any of the more
dangerous worlds. None of them opposed Ji Ning’s presence; his
master was Subhuti, after all, while his senior apprentice-brother
was Houyi. They had to give these two figures some face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti.” After
being silent for a long moment, Daoist Three Purities turned his head
to look at Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong turned to look
at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they all liked
Ji Ning very much, this was an extremely important undertaking.
Personal feelings could not be allowed to interfere with their
decisions. They had to make the best decisions possible for the
alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Subhuti
began to laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers
present all looked towards Subhuti in confusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti, what are
you laughing at?” Exalted Celestial Thundergod frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti glanced
sideways at Thundergod, then said, “Ji Ning definitely won’t
become a burden.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong, Daoist Three
Purities, Suiren, and the others all revealed curious looks on their
faces. The major powers seated below them began to whispers amongst
themselves as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti chuckled again
but said nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As inscrutable and
mysterious as ever.” Daoist Three Purities shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
you will know.” Subhuti raised a white eyebrow at the group. Houyi,
seated next to him, revealed a hint of a smile. He had known Subhuti
for far, far too long. He knew exactly what type of a personality his
master had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers
continued to chat and jest with each other. For people as long-lived
as them, a conversation or a debate about the Dao could easily last
for thousands of years. In the past, before the war had begun, two of
them might spend a century on a single game of chess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Graceful Peacock was seated below them, and in this moment her
beautiful, gentle face changed dramatically. “Everyone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all the
major powers turned their heads to look at Graceful Peacock. Four of
her clones were with the four squads while the fifth one was here at
the Allclans Palace. She was responsible for sending and delivering
messages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the heavy
look on her face, all the major powers felt their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, Kuafu’s
team was trapped inside a danger zone, the ‘Earthmoan Mountain’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthmoan Mountain?”
All of the major powers were shocked. Earthmoan Mountain was an
extremely famous danger zone. Long ago, when the Daofathers of the
Three Realms had entered the Primordial Ruinworld to test themselves,
some had died there!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthmoan Mountain
is extremely dangerous.” Daoist Three Purities immediately said,
“I’ve been there before, and I ended up being trapped for more
than three thousand years. Have Tathagata go to them right away.
Tathagata has the best chance of them all for overcoming Earthmoan
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Graceful
Peacock nodded frantically. “I’ve already informed Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha and the other three are heading there right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld. The Thousand Mountains world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent more
than three months here in the Primordial Ruinworld. He had followed
Kuafu’s team this entire time and had experienced no real danger
thus far at al.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Thousand
Mountains world. We have to be careful,” Graceful Peacock warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, if any
danger appears, I’ll smush it with my foot!” Kuafu hoisted up his
wooden staff as he laughed loudly, but after laughing he still said
to Daofather Windfate, “Windfate, keep a close watch on things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daofather
Windfate nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven of them were
flying atop a cloud, and the land around them was filled with
countless mighty mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I suddenly
have the feeling that we just went past this mountain a while ago?”
Ning suddenly pointed towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Kuafu stared
at him, then took a close look as well. He then nodded repeatedly.
“Right. We just went past this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Daofather Windfate concentrated for a moment, then the look on his
face completely changed. “This is a formation that uses mountain
ranges as the base. This is an extremely large formation, and it is
extremely hard to detect. They must’ve switched just a few of the
nearby mountains. Even I didn’t notice anything at all earlier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are already
trapped inside a formation?” Xingtian was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are already
inside.” Daofather Windfate nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
Kuafu hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two options,”
Daofather Windfate said. “One, we forcibly destroy the formation by
wrecking all those mountain peaks. If we do that, we’ll be able to
leave. But this should be a formation that was set up by Keeper
Everwood, and he’s extremely skilled in the usage of plants and
rocks. If he was the one to make this formation…judging from how
large it is, we probably won’t be able to break it apart. The
second option is to solve and break the formation itself, but we
can’t do that either. Perhaps only Fuxi would be able to do that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump. It was like a
heartbeat that rang out from deep within the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump. Thump. Thump.
One deep heartbeat after another rang out, echoing throughout the
area. The ‘mountain ranges’ around them suddenly disappeared,
transforming into endless amounts of foul water that flowed out in
rivers and creeks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cloud which Ning’s
group was on had actually been completely surrounded by the reeking
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-this…this is
Earthmoan Mountain.” Daofather Windfate’s face instantly turned
completely ashen. “Too late. It’s all too late.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We actually ended up
being drawn into Earthmoan Mountain without even knowing it.”
Luwu’s face had changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them felt their
heartrates quicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a profound
formation.” Ning said softly, “We didn’t notice anything at all
earlier…and by the time we did, we had already been lured into
Earthmoan Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Buddha has
already been notified. He’s on his way right now,” Graceful
Peacock said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone. No matter what, don’t let yourself get separated.”
Kuafu growled savagely, “This is the most dangerous place we have
encountered since entering the Primordial Ruinworld. Even if Lord
Buddha comes, he’ll still need time to break apart Earthmoan
Mountain! We need to hang on and endure until he manages to break us
free. If we cannot…then we will die in here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
the rest of the six all nodded. They now all had solemn looks on
their faces. At a time like this, no one dared to be overconfident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The cries of the
earth have already begun,” Graceful Peacock said. “When the cries
of the earth reach a crescendo, deadly danger shall descend upon us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump! Yet another
earthen heartbeat rang out, this one even louder than the previous
ones. Even the endless flows of foul water around them seemed to
shudder.
</P>

Chapter 14 - Earthmoan Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha and his three companions were flying through the air like an
enormous streak of golden light as they rapidly advanced towards
Earthmoan Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graceful Peacock,
can they keep holding?” Tathagata sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were countless
beings living in Tathagata’s [Buddha-Realm Within the Palm], with
one of Graceful Peacock’s clones being there as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heartbeat sounds
are rapidly becoming stronger and louder. When the sounds reach a
crescendo, the attacks will begin. Right now all of us are waiting
carefully, but we have yet to be attacked,” Graceful Peacock
replied from within the Buddha-realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be
careful.” Tathagata said a few more words, then turned to the three
Buddhas by his side. “You should also enter my Buddha-realm for now
as well. I’ll be able to travel more quickly that way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Lord Buddha,”
the other three Buddhas replied. Tathagata was the undisputed leader
of the Buddist community.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata waved his
hand and collected those three Buddhas. Immediately after doing so,
the midair golden streak of light surrounding him became even quicker
as it flew towards Earthmoan Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the castle
located deep inside the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, success!
Kuafu’s squad has already been lured into Earthmoan Mountain,”
the skinny elder said jubilantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike,
seated atop his throne, let out a soft chuckle. “When we make a
move, we have to make a big one! We let these bumpkins from the Three
Realms have too easy a time of it earlier. Now, it’s time to give
them a hard hit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousand
Mountains world is a world which both we and the Seamless Gate have
spent enormous time, effort, and resources building up. The entire
world is a huge trap. The Nuwa Alliance obviously knows that, but
they still have to charge straight inside.” The red-bearded elder
let out a laugh. “They can’t locate us. All they can do is wreck
the entire Primordial Ruinworld in their hunt. They have to assault
and destroy every single world. It’s very possible that we’ll be
able to wipe out two or three of their squads here at Thousand
Mountains world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu’s squad
should be done for, at least.” Godfiend Witherspike nodded slowly.
“As for the other three…let’s see how talented they are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven remained standing on his feet, staring
at the scene being played out in midair. It was a scene showing
Earthmoan Mountain, with Kuafu’s squad having already been trapped
inside of it. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven let out a cold laugh.
“Now that you’ve entered Earthmoan Mountain, I want to see just
how you’ll survive this one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Buddha
Tathagata is advancing rapidly towards Earthmoan Mountain,” the
towering, muscular, golden-armored figure suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Keeper
Everwood personally set up the formations around Earthmoan Mountain,
and the formations are already activated and constantly transforming.
Once Tathagata charges into the formation, he’ll virtually have no
chance of locating Earthmoan Mountain unless he actually destroys the
formation itself. Given his power, he might actually be able to do
that…but he’ll need time. By the time he succeeds, Kuafu’s
squad would’ve died long ago.” Godfiend Witherspike smiled,
licking his lower lips with his bright red tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, the exalted
Godfiend, had been biding his time for far too long. This title,
‘Godfiend’…it was a title that had been won through countless
seas of blood and mountains of severed flesh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Earthmoan
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">THUMP!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An extremely loud
heartbeat rang out from under the ground, and the sound seemed to
smash against the hearts of Ji Ning and the others. The entire team
floated in midair, carefully watching their surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the six of
us have set up a formation; we can work together to defend against
any sneak attacks. You, however, don’t have anything protecting
you. I think you should enter an estate-treasure for now. After we
escape from Earthmoan Mountain, you can come out once more.”
Kuafu’s group of six had already joined together into an enormous
formation, and they were sharing their divine power with each other.
All of them were surrounded by rings of golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu frowned slightly
upon seeing this. “This is a critical situation. You can’t be
headstrong, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry
about me, fellow Daoist Kuafu. When my true body was destroyed by the
Seamless Gate, I still ended up surviving, right?” Ning looked at
Kuafu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu was briefly
startled, then nodded. “If you aren’t willing to hide, fine. How
about this? Stay inside of our formation. If there any attacks come
your way, the formation will be able to help you block a few blows.
This formation protects against external attacks but not internal
attacks. You’ll still be able to fight back from inside the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded in acceptance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Xingtian,
Empress Xi, Windfate, Graceful Peacock, Luwu. These six True Gods
were sharing their divine power with each other. Rings of golden
light were surrounding them, helping to defend against any dangers,
and Ning was located within the formation itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six True Gods
exchanged glances with each other, feeling quite resigned. As they
saw it, this Sword Immortal Darknorth was being far too rash and
arrogant. Earthmoan Mountain was such an incredibly dangerous place
that even the six of them had to be extremely careful. In fact, they
had even asked Lord Buddha to come rescue them. Ji Ning, however,
insisted on staying outside…ugh! This overconfidence stemmed from
the fact that he simply hadn’t trained for long enough!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump! Thump! Thump!
Suddenly, the ‘pulse’ began to quicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusions around
them began to change as well. Previously, they had been surrounded by
endless tides of foul water. Now, it suddenly changed to a dense
thicket of trees. Ning and the six were all standing within the
thicket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and leave.
Fly out of the thicket,” Kuafu said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! All seven of
them strove to fly out, but no matter how hard or how quickly they
flew, they remained trapped within the thicket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t be able
to fly out. Without being able to see through the illusions of
Earthmoan Mountain, there’s no way we can leave it at all.”
Daofather Windfate shook his head after taking another look. “When
Daoist Three Purities was trapped here, he was able to rely on his
incredible power to survive against the dangers present. Despite
that, he was still trapped here for more than three thousand years
before he was able to see the true face of Earthmoan Mountain and
leave it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all
illusions.” Graceful Peacock was worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We aren’t able to
see through them and see the true face of Earthmoan Mountain,”
Xingtian said with concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully
inspected the surrounding area as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthmoan Mountain was
extremely famous. Once you entered it, you would face countless
changing illusions and be perpetually trapped by them. Major powers
might try to fly out with all their might, but they would remain
within Earthmoan Mountain, unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only two
methods for leaving this place. The first was to rely on overwhelming
raw power to annihilate the entire Earthmoan Mountain! However, not
even Daoist Three Purities had been able to destroy this bizarre
place. Most likely, only World Gods like Mother Nuwa would be able to
accomplish it. There was no chance whatsoever that Ning’s group
would be able to do it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second method was
to do what Daoist Three Purities did; to see through the illusions
and see the truth of Earthmoan Mountain. It would then be possible to
fly out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha was extremely skilled in seeing through illusions. The
Buddhists were all quite skilled in illusions to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Suddenly, a
terrifying attack descended, stabbing straight towards True God Luwu.
The layers of golden light protecting True God Luwu were instantly
pierced through! Judging from the way in which the piercing occurred,
it appeared as the attack came from an awl-shaped object.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Luwu was so
frightened that he immediately lashed out with his whip to block
while frantically dodging.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Luwu’s flank
was sliced open. A large bloody wound appeared on his side, but his
divine power quickly healed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be
careful. Earthmoan Mountain’s attacks are very powerful,” True
God Luwu said hurriedly. “The formation is unable to completely
block it. However, the formation is still able to whittle away at its
power a bit. If it wasn’t for the formation, I wouldn’t have
merely lost a chunk of flesh; I would’ve been ripped in half.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,”
Daofather Windfate said solemnly. “It looks like we are surrounded
by a thicket of trees, but all of that is illusory. The true scene is
that of those strange objects flying towards us and attacking us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite being weakened
by their protective formation, that strange object was still able to
easily wound a True God. This was simply far too terrifying. The
worst part of it was…they had no idea where it had come from. By
the time they were able to notice it, its attack would have already
arrived as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
Ning carefully scanned his surroundings, his eyes blazing with
torch-light. He used the [Torch-Dragon’s Eye] to carefully scan the
area, but the only result was that the trees and the leaves around
them became even sharper and more in-focus. He could now even see the
leafy veins! But alas, he couldn’t find any traces of an illusion
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To see through the
illusions and see the truth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How am I supposed to
do that? When Daoist Three Purities was trapped here, he was also
unable to leave until he saw through the illusions and saw the
truth.” Ning frowned. “But how?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was carefully
inspecting his surroundings with his physical vision, his coresense,
and even his heartforce. All his senses, however, were ‘seeing’
exactly the same things his eyes were seeing. It was as though the
trees and the thicket around them actually were real. In truth, it
made sense; even Daoist Three Purities had been trapped here for
three thousand years before being able to escape. Seeing through the
illusions would be no easy feet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heartforce
rippled out from him in a series of waves as Ning used the heartforce
scrying technique which World God Northrest had transmitted to him,
causing his heartforce scanned through every inch of space around
him. This scanning technique could be said to be the most detailed
such technique in the Three Realms. It truly surpassed all other
similar techniques; Ning had searched the memories of the Fiendgods
and Immortals of the Pangaea prisoners but was still unable to find
any heartforce scrying technique that could compare to his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, his rippling
heartforce seemed to detect a slight wave of motion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible object
once more stabbed straight through the layers of golden light and
pierced towards Empress Xi.
</P>

Chapter 15 - That Tiny Wave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empress Xi only noticed
the attack after the strange object had torn through all those layers
of protection. Her face instantly changed. “Not good!” She
hurriedly dodged while brandishing her sleeves to block. Clang! The
sharp object struck against her sleeves, then flew off towards
another direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone.” Empress Xi said hurriedly, “It is too fast; you can’t
let yourself be caught offguard!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xingtian, do you
have any more shield-type treasures?” True God Luwu asked
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Xingtian
produced a small buckler in his hand, then sent it flying towards
True God Luwu. It rapidly increased in size, becoming nearly half his
height. True God Luwu grabbed the buckler with one hand, using his
other to continue holding onto his metal whip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xingtian was similarly
holding a buckler in one hand and his Heaven Punisher Axe in the
other. He hurriedly asked, “Anyone else need a buckler?” As he
spoke his gaze couldn’t help but turn towards Ning, located in the
center of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the seven, Kuafu was
the strongest. Xingtian and Empress Xi were next, but Xingtian
already had a buckler while Empress xi was skilled in using her
sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next came Graceful
Peacock, Windfate, and Luwu. Luwu had already acquired a buckler,
while Daofather Windfate used his fan. The fan could also be used as
a shield, and Daofather Windfate would actually be able to unleash
more power with his fan than with a buckler. As for Graceful Peacock,
her ‘body’ had been forged from a peacock feather that was
comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure. She was
actually safer than any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Xingtian saw it, Ji
Ning was a wielder of the sword. The sword was an offensive weapon;
defensively speaking, it was comparatively lacking. He felt that Ji
Ning would most likely need a buckler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need one
just yet.” Ning smiled and shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,”
Xingtian warned, then fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attacks continued to
rain down upon them from those invisible objects. The six True Gods
all guarded carefully against the attacks, and they even decided to
shrink the perimeter of their formation so as to better protect Ji
Ning within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Fiendgods
worked together to defend against nineteen waves of attacks. Ji Ning,
by contrast, had things easy; protected in the center of the
formation, he didn’t suffer any attacks at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? It seems to have
ended,” Graceful Peacock said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The cries of the
earth are growing softer,” Kuafu agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump. Thump.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heartbeat ringing
out from deep underground had indeed grown quieter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After a period of
time, the sound will grow louder again and the attacks will start
anew,” Kuafu said. “Let’s rest for now and prepare to deal with
the next wave of attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Fiendgods all had rather ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The invisible attacks
were simply too powerful, and they were also extraordinarily
unpredictable. During the nineteen waves of attacks, True God Luwu
had been injured three times, Daofather Windfate had been injured
twice, Empress Xi and Xingtian had each been injured once, while
Kuafu, Ning, and Graceful Peacock were uninjured. Each time they
suffered an injury, they had to use a large amount of divine power to
heal it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using divine power to
heal one’s body was extremely taxing. As more time passed the
divine power would be used up, at which point they wouldn’t even be
able to maintain the formation! The reason why they had been able to
survive the nineteen waves of attacks was because the formation
served to weaken the power of those attacks. If they were to face
those attacks head on, even Kuafu would be in danger of dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone could sense
death impending. The atmosphere naturally turned quite grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guy Ji Ning…all
of us are so nervous, but he’s actually daydreaming?!” True God
Luwu gave Ning, still located at the center of the formation, a hard
look. Ning stood in the center, eyes completely blank. Clearly, his
mind was elsewhere and he was completely preoccupied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” True God
Luwu was an amiable and honest fellow. He didn’t say anything.
“We’ll do our best. If we can protect Ji Ning, we will. If we end
up dying, there will be nothing more that we can do. He’s just too
young.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to stand
there, pondering to himself. “Each time there is an attack,
especially when the attack draws close, I can dimly sense a hint of a
ripple spread out. Clearly, the power of the attacks is so great that
at a close distance, there’s no way for it to completely avoid my
senses. However, I can just sense a tiny wave each time. There’s no
way for me to completely verify the exact location the strange object
is coming from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those ripples were
perhaps coming from the strange objects, but when those invisible
things attacked they instantly arrived before their target, giving
the defenders no time to spare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to verify and
track the direction from which each attack is going to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how powerful
these attacks are, they have to cause at least a tiny bit of spatial
disruption.” Ning stared at the thickets around them. “Still…the
illusions around us are simply too realistic, and the area around us
is filled with multiple ripples that mask the ones coming from those
strange objects.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What I need to do is
to separate the ripples caused by the illusions from the ripples
caused by the strange objects.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been watching
closely during the last ten-plus attacks, but he was still unable to
ascertain exactly where each attack was going to come from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump! The heartbeat
coming from deep beneath the earth suddenly began to grow stronger
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump! Thump! Thump!
The heartbeats began to quicken and strengthen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone. The next wave of attacks from Earthmoan Mountain is about
to begin,” Kuafu barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
five True Gods hurriedly acknowledged him. They pumped more energy
into their formation, staying on maximum alert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, his eyes
were lidded as he circulated his soul heartforce technique, using it
to attune himself to all the many varied ripples that that were
occurring around them. There were ripples caused by the wind, by
light, by spatial movement, by scent…Ning was able to separate out
the spatial ripples, but what he needed to do right now was to
identify the specific spatial ripples being generated by those
strange objects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even for a major power
like Ning, this was incredibly difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daoist Three
Purities had ended up spending more than three thousand years before
accomplishing this. Ning’s advantage lay in the formidable
techniques taught to him by World God Northrest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The invisible attacks
began to descend upon them once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Xingtian, and
the rest all did their best to defend against the attacks, using all
of their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That seems…to be a
spatial ripple caused by those strange objects…” Ning remained
inside the formation, eyes half-lidded as he continued to carefully
attune to the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I really
think you should enter an estate-treasure,” Xingtian bellowed. He
was fairly close to Ji Ning on a personal level. Ning, however,
didn’t respond to him, instead continuing to sweep the area with
his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms, the
Allclans Palace of the Primordial Imperial Clan. Many major powers
were gathered in this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry.” Graceful
Peacock frantically rose to her feet and said, “This is the third
time Earthmoan Mountain is attacking us. True God Luwu has been
gravely injured, and his divine power is almost used up. Once he’s
completely dry, there will be no way for them to maintain the
formation. Kuafu and the others are about to die in Earthmoan
Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata.” Daoist
Three Purities looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m working on
breaking the formation,” Lord Buddha said hurriedly. “This should
be a formation which Keeper Everwood spent enormous amounts of effort
on. He’s used the countless mountains in the area to serve as his
formation-bases. Although I’m breaking it apart as fast as I can, I
still need more time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are no other
options.” Tathagata shook his head. “Even if all of you head
there right away, you’ll first have to reach their location. By the
time you get there, I would’ve broken through the formation long
ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
nodded. It was true. Thousand Mountains world was a place filled with
countless dangers. There was no way to teleport through the Void to
arrive at at that place. Ji Ning, Tathagata, Fuxi, and the others had
all been forced to slowly fly their way there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi is the best at
defeating formations, but he’s been tied down by those alien
Outsiders of the Primordial Ruinworld,” Graceful Peacock said
hurriedly. “There’s no way for him to get there in time either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood…” The
seated Daofather Subhuti had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In war, one of the most
terrifying possibilities was fighting in an arena of your enemy’s
choosing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their enemies had
already made complete preparations in the Primordial Ruinworld. The
Nuwa Alliance knew that…but no matter what, they wouldn’t be
willing to give the Primordial Ruinworld the chance to ambush the
victors of the Endwar. If for no other reason than to uproot an ally
of the Seamless Gate, they had to wipe out the Primordial Ruinworld!
However, they were indeed worried about the deadly environment and
illusions located within the Primordial Ruinworld, which was why they
had only sent two of their overlord-class figures in this campaign.
The other major powers would all remain on guard in the Three Realms.
If something unexpected happened, they would be able to handle it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
unleashed all of my dharma-bodies. I’ll be able to break the
formation soon,” Tathagata said with a solemn look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha’s squad
truly had gone all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other three Buddhas
who had come with him had assembled into a formation. Their holy
light spread out in every direction as they launched all sorts of
attacks against the land, each strike filled with the power to
shatter the heavens and wreck the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Lord Buddha, he
had switched into a different form, unleashing all three of his
bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three bodies were
his Sakyamuni body, his Great Sun Buddha body 1, and his Medicine
Buddha body 2. The three of them sent their mighty Buddha-palms
smashing down from the skies, shattering apart one mountain range
after another with each blow. However, each time some of the mountain
ranges would once more be reborn from the natural energy of Heaven
and Earth. This was clearly the power of the formation at work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata had been born
a True God of Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, he had shattered his own soul, leaving behind just a tendril of
his truesoul to be reincarnated into the human race. He had become
Sakyamuni, and as a result had been truly reborn. He finally was able
to reach the pinnacle of power, fully mastering the five Heavenly
Daos of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. This allowed him to
manifest five mighty dharma-bodies! However, actually using these
five dharma-bodies consumed a terrifying amount of energy. He would
only activate them all when he was truly going all-out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had brought three of
his five dharma-bodies in this campaign against the Primordial
Ruinworld, leaving behind two of them to guard the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
had his ‘Three Pure Ones’ technique. Tathagata, in term, had five
dharma-bodies, with the most powerful naturally being his true
Sakyamuni body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata’s quite
powerful.” Godfiend Witherspike let out a sigh as he saw the scene
playing out of Tathagata breaking apart the formation with utterly
ruinous power. “These aboriginals only have inferior Ki Refining
techniques; they are clearly Ancestral Immortals, but only third-tier
ones! And yet, despite that, the most monstrously talented amongst
them have gained incredible insights into the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi’s been tied
down for now as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keeper Everwood’s
formations are quite formidable. Even if other major powers were to
make their way over, they would still need to spend a considerable
amount of time to break through the formation. After doing so, they
would then need to actually enter Earthmoan Mountain! Earthmoan
Mountain is filled with countless illusions; to actually locate
Kuafu’s squad will require time as well. I estimate that Kuafu’s
squad should already be at the verge of breaking down,” Godfiend
Witherspike mused softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how furious
and frantic Tathagata is in trying to break through the formation as
quickly as possible, Kuafu’s squad should be close to being done
for,” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were just
guessing, of course. Earthmoan Mountain was one of the most hazardous
of regions that had been naturally created from the Primordial
Ruinworld. Even the alien Outsiders were unable to scry inside of it
to see what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation inside
Earthmoan Mountain truly had turned grim. True God Luwu and Daofather
Windfate had ashen looks on their faces, and their bodies were
covered with bloody wounds. They no longer had enough divine power to
repair and heal their bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Yet another
ruthless, cruel attack by an invisible object.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes had been
lidded this entire time, but now they suddenly opened. His eyes
sparkled like the stars as he murmured softly to himself, “I
finally found it.”

Chapter 16 - Wokejade Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Luwu, Windfate, give
up for now. I’ll take you into my estate-treasure,” Kuafu
shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Although True
God Luwu was usually an amiable and honest fellow, he was currently
quite resolute and unyielding. “Kuafu, you know very well how
dangerous Earthmoan Mountain is. The only reason we are still alive
is because of the formation. Once we enter the estate-treasure, the
two of us will be able to live for a bit longer, true. But the rest
of you will no longer have the formation protecting you. You won’t
be able to hold on for much longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single cell of
my body is formed from divine power. Although I’m out of actual
power, I can still convert my body into divine power. I can still
hold,” True God Luwu growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll keep
holding.” Daofather Windfate nodded, his eyes filled with cold
resolve. “Kuafu, don’t go soft on us. There’s no way out for
the six of us. This campaign against the Primordial Ruinworld is
actually the final precursor to the Endwar. There will always be
casualties in war. It is now my time to die, and I won’t shirk
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Empress Xi,
Xingtian, and Graceful Peacock all felt quite torn. However, they
understood that this was indeed the best decision when keeping the
big picture in perspective. The bodies of True God Luwu and True God
Windfate were indeed manifested from large amounts of divine power.
They absolutely were capable of continuing to hold on, but only at a
price…the price being that they could die at any moment from an
attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep holding,”
Kuafu growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect Luwu and
Windfate!” Xingtian let out a howl, then turned to look towards Ji
Ning. “Ji Ning, do your best to help Windfate and Luwu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xingtian had always
felt very well-disposed towards Ji Ning. It was one thing for Ji Ning
not to help out when they were travelling around, but things were now
different; they were trapped here in the deadly environs of Earthmoan
Mountain. Ji Ning was quite safe at the center of the formation, but
he hadn’t even helped out a single time! This caused Xingtian to
feel quite displeased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly made his
move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a single instant, he
stepped out of the center of the formation. He actually stabbed out
with his sword, and a dazzling rainbow aura of swordforce sparkled
around the tip of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Xingtian, and
the rest of the six True Gods were instantly dumbfounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had actually
left the formation? Kuafu and the others were about to immediately
rebuke him for doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he had then struck
out with his sword? Why did he do that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rainbow-colored
sword-light? T-that was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sudden actions
had caused the six True Gods to be instantly and completely
stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! A clanking sound
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-tip
seemed to have stabbed onto something. An incredibly loud collision
could be heard as space around the sword-tip began to ripple
violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here.”
Ning’s sword spun about, transforming into a black hole that
possessed astonishing absorptive power. It was able to forcibly
entangle and entrap the invisible object.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light
completely surrounded the invisible object, forcing it to finally
reveal its true form. A strange object that was shaped like the horn
of an ox had appeared. It was completely black in color, but it was
also covered with strands of violet-colored vein lines. It was sharp
at one end and blunt at the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Ning reached
out and grabbed the object.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavy wokejade?”
Ning mused to himself. If one was to voyage through the endless
primordial chaos, one naturally had to first become familiar with
many of the strange objects within it. World God Northrest had
transmitted a great deal of this information to Ning, who was able to
recognize this object at a glance. “It’s actually heavy wokejade?
This is quite a valuable mineral. However, no one in the Three Realms
is capable of smelting it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heavy wokejade was
incomparably resilient. Even prior to smelting and forging, it was as
tough and resilient as a Chaos treasure. This truly was an extremely
precious mineral.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I’ll
enter the primordial chaos and travel to Vastheaven Palace. Perhaps
it will be of use to me at some point.” Ning waved his hand,
collecting the item and pulling it into his estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then turned his
head to look behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six True Gods were
staring at him, rather dazed. Empress Xi’s mouth was open, as
though she wanted to say something, but no words could come out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” In the
end, it was the straightforward and blunt Kuafu who spoke out. “Your
swordforce reached the fifth stage?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Why didn’t you
tell us earlier?” Kuafu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, we didn’t
run into any danger that you couldn’t easily deal with, Kuafu.
There was no real need for me to get involved,” Ning said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Xingtian
said hurriedly, “Ji Ning, are you able to see through the illusions
of Earthmoan Mountain?” If he was, they’d be able to leave this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luwu, Windfate, and the
others all felt relieved. Although they had mentally prepared
themselves for death, staying alive was naturally much preferred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow Ji Ning,
everyone!” Kuafu said hurriedly, “Do what he says.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The six
True Gods all immediately followed behind Ning, who advanced with
sword in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another one is
coming.” Ning once more struck out with his sword. His sword-arts
flashed out in an unpredictable, ephemeral manner. It instantly
struck against yet another invisible attacking object. Ning’s
sword-art once more transformed into a black hole, trapping the
second invisible object as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthmoan Mountain
should be a ‘Wokejade Realm’.” Ning once more reached out with
his hand to grab the piece of heavy wokejade. He glanced at it, then
tossed it into his estate-treasure. “In all the Three Realms, I’d
wager that no one knows as much as me about Earthmoan Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless primordial
chaos was filled with countless dangers, and World God Northrest had
recorded details regarding many of them. If you were to foolishly
adventure through the primordial chaos without knowing about some of
the dangerous types of regions within it, you truly would be courting
death. No one would be able to save such a fool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wokejade Realms were a
type of danger zone which World God Northrest had written about.
Based on the information Ning had, he was able to quickly ascertain
that Earthmoan Mountain was a type of Wokejade Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, how long
before we can leave?” Empress Xi looked at Ji Ning in a different
way now. Fifth-stage swordforce, and sword-arts that surpassed the
Heavenly Daos; these two points alone ensured that Ji Ning had to be
very close to the overlord level of power! His single-target attacks
would be even more terrifying than Kuafu’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Ning said. “Earthmoan Mountain is essentially a world unto itself;
if you don’t see through its illusions, there’s no way to escape
it at all. When we talk about ‘seeing the truth’, we aren’t
talking about literally seeing through all the illusions. Rather,
what I can do is just barely get a sense of where those strange
objects are going to attack from. Through them, I can get a rough
sense of direction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Through those
strange objects?” Windfate, Graceful Peacock, Luwu, and the others
were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those things that
are attacking us are formed deep underneath the ground. They are
expelled with astonishing power through Earthmoan Mountain’s
eruptions,” Ning said. “The closer we are to the core of
Earthmoan Mountain, the more powerful those objects will be. The
farther away we are, the weaker they will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard Daoist Three
Purities say the same.” Empress Xi nodded. “However, that’ll
only allow you to get a very crude sense of direction. In addition,
Earthmoan Mountain’s dangers aren’t just limited to those
invisible objects.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…I heard that
Earthmoan Mountain can also give birth to terrifyingly powerful
attractive forces that can devour even major powers,” Graceful
Peacock said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “That is
indeed the case.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wokejade Realms were
usually in the ‘eruption’ phase, but they occasionally had a
‘devouring’ phase as well! Each time there was a ‘devouring’
phase, the closer you were to the core the more powerful the
attractive force would be. Once you were actually swallowed inside…it
was virtually guaranteed that you would perish, even if you were an
Ancestral Immortal or an Elder God. It would take some truly
impressive and extraordinary measures for you to survive. If you were
able to safely enter the deep recesses of the realm, you would be
able to acquire an enormous amount of heavy wokejade. The heavy
wokejade itself was formed through countless eruption cycles and
devouring cycles, resulting in the swallowed objects being refined
into priceless treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pieces of heavy
wokejade that ‘attacked’ Ning’s group with each eruption was
just a tiny fraction of the enormous hoard of heavy wokejade that
existed deep underneath Earthmoan Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why we have
to move quickly. It is currently in the ‘eruption’ phase. Once
the ‘devouring’ phase begins, things will become even more
dangerous.” Ning still felt quite confident, and in truth only the
core regions of Earthmoan Mountain would pose a threat to him. The
ordinary regions were of no threat to him at all; he himself already
had the power of an overlord-class figure, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led the way quite
quickly. They only walked forward for a brief period of time before
suddenly, the world turned bright. The thicket of forests around them
vanished, transforming into an awe-inspiring sight of chained
mountain ranges. Far off in the distance, mountains were continuously
toppling and falling apart. They could vaguely make out three mighty
figures that glowed with boundless golden light. The three figures
were furiously striking out with Buddha-palms, and each palm
contained utterly ruinous power that was being used to annihilate the
surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Tathagata,”
Kuafu said delightedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“TATHAGATA!”
Xingtian called out to him in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
“We made it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So these are
Tathagata’s dharma-bodies?” Ning stared at Tathagata’s three
mighty dharma-bodies, paying especial attention to the Sakyamuni
body. “He’s merely a True God and third-tier Ancestral Immortal,
but his insights into the Dao are so profound that he is still able
to unleash the power of an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Lord Buddha
noticed the seven tiny figures appear as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.”
Finally, a smile blossomed on Tathagata’s face. His two other
dharma-bodies merged into his true body, and the three Buddhas behind
him flew forward towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata’s squad of
four Buddhas all flew towards Ning, and Ning’s group of seven rode
a cloud towards them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You ended up
escaping on your own.” Tathagata laughed. “I wonder how you did
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was Darknorth.”
Graceful Peacock spoke out from within Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?”
Tathagata looked towards Ning with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu agreed. “Right.
Ji Ning is extremely powerful. I’m afraid that even I wouldn’t
necessarily be a match for him. Three Purities was trapped here for
more than three thousand years, but Ji Ning managed to lead us out
after just a short period of time. Ahahaha! Once that old Daoist
hears about this, I wonder what sort of an expression he will have on
his face?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And at this exact
moment back in the Three Realms, Graceful Peacock was narrating
everything which had just happened to the concerned major powers of
the Nuwa Alliance.

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graceful Peacock was
narrating the entire story to the major powers present. “We were
trapped in Earthmoan Mountain, and both Luwu and Windfate were
heavily wounded. We were just about finished, but Darknorth…fellow
Daoist Darknorth had been carefully scrutinizing everything from
inside our formation, and he finally was able to see through the
illusions of Earthmoan Mountain and see the truth. He walked out of
our formation, then blocked several invisible attacks of Earthmoan
Mountain as he led us to safety.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked those
attacks?” Exalted Celestial Thundergod asked, “Graceful Peacock,
didn’t you say that the attacks of Earthmoan Mountain are extremely
powerful? Empress Xi was just barely able to defend against those
attacks, thanks to the protective formation, but she was still
wounded. Ji Ning walked out of the formation, and THEN blocked those
attacks?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Graceful
Peacock nodded, her eyes sparkling as she smiled. “Fellow Daoist
Darknorth is one of the most peerless figures to ever exist, ever
since Pangu established Heaven and Earth. He has already reached the
fifth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage?”
Exalted Celestial Thundergod was incredulous. “How is that
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire palace
became a hubbub of commotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifth-stage swordforce?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone and everyone who
could reach the fifth stage of swordforce would become one of the
most elite Daofathers alive. Someone like Ji Ning, who also knew the
[Five Treasures] sword-art, would be even more terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that true?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He hasn’t even
trained for a thousand years, right?” The major powers were all
discussing this in hushed voices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha, seated on high, spoke out. “It is indeed so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod was now truly dazed. He could no longer say a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!”
Daofather Subhuti, also seated on high, started to laugh. <BR> Next
to him was Daoist Three Purities, who laughed as well. “Subhuti,
you knew all along?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti just smugly
stroked his beard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My junior
apprentice-brother truly is formidable.” Houyi laughed as well. “We
have gained yet another mighty general for the Endwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod was filled with many mixed emotions. He was an aloof,
arrogant figure, and he originally had not held Ji Ning in any
regard. Ji Ning’s performance at the Deerchaser world, though…it
had caused Thundergod to feel rather upset. Still, he was able to
console himself that the kid had relied on the Rahu Formation and the
Envoy of All Things. The kid’s true power was still quite weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, the ‘kid’
had fifth-stage swordforce and sword-arts that surpassed the limits
of the Heavenly Daos. This meant that Ji Ning was now, indisputably,
the number one Sword Immortal of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti.” Finally,
Thundergod spoke out. “Congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at
Thundergod and chortled. “This old Daoist loves to put on airs and
keep people guessing. I hope you aren’t too angry with me,
Thundergod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could I be? Our
Nuwa Alliance has gained yet another powerful general. I couldn’t
be happier!” Thundergod replied honestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Thundergod was
a stubborn, solitary, and arrogant figure, his loyalty to the Nuwa
Alliance was absolutely beyond reproach. In the end…it had been
Subhuti’s dear old friend, Old Man Yuan, a figure far more powerful
than Thundergod, who had ended up vacillating between the two sides.
To this very day, he still had yet to join the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My old friend…I
truly don’t wish to end up in a fight to the death against you,”
Subhuti murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a damaged,
badly ravaged planet, but there were two major powers present here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man with a red
nose was seated in the lotus position in front of a thatched cottage.
Before him was a small table, and across from him sat the
white-bearded Subhuti. This was one of Subhuti’s incarnations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations.
Your disciple actually reached the fifth stage of swordforce.” The
red-nosed elder sighed with emotion. “A pity, such a pity. I knew
all along that Ji Ning’s potential was extraordinarily. I really
wanted to take him on as my disciple, but you refused to accept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t actually
refuse you,” Subhuti said. “I told you; so long as you joined our
side, you could immediately take on Ji Ning as your disciple. But you
refused to accept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still cannot
accept.” Old Man Yuan shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti let out a cold
laugh. “We’ve been fighting against the Seamless Gate for so long
now. You should be able to tell that our differences are completely
irreconcilable. At a time like this…you continue to waver! You said
all those pompous things about ‘not wanting to see all your old
friends die, one by one’…but your actions now are causing even
more of our old friends to die! Your words are complete bullshit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Old Man Yuan
nodded, a distant look in his eyes. “I admit that I said those
things for the sake of saving face. All of those things I said were
lies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti just looked at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt pain in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all emerged
together from the primordial chaos as ignorant, wide-eyed newborns.
They had all supported each other, discussed the Dao together,
advanced together on the path of cultivation. They were so close to
each other that they were like actual brothers. Some of them had
ended up dying in the chaotic wars of the Primordial Era, while
others had died in the war that had ended that era. Daoist
Threelives, for example, had already perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not many were still
alive…but this old friend of his, ‘Old Man Yuan’, had actually
refused to stand alongside them at such a critical hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You finally admit to
it,” Subhuti said icily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Old Man Yuan
shook his head. “Ever since the Primordial Era, we have suffered
incursions from alien Outsiders. When we killed them, we gained some
of their techniques and some of their records regarding the infinite
primordial chaos. I came to understand that this place of ours is
nothing more than a single chaosworld. The primordial chaos is a far
vaster universe. When I learned this, I became filled with the desire
to travel far away, to see more things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We ‘True Gods’
who were born from the primordial chaos were nothing more than local
bumpkins who were born to this region. How can we be considered
‘major powers’? We simply relied on the power we gained at
birth.” Old Man Yuan shook his head. “In the endless primordial
chaos, the true ‘major powers’ are the World Gods and Chaos
Immortals. They are capable of easily wiping out our entire world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa saw the truth
long ago. The Three Realms was too small a place to contain her, and
so she left to enter the vaster world outside of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to journey
through that vast world as well.” Old Man Yuan’s eyes were filled
with desire. “But I’m not strong enough yet. Those alien
Outsiders, the Lord of All Things…I learned that even someone as
formidable as the Lord of All Things was nothing more than a minor
figure in the primordial chaos. There are many who are far more
powerful than him. As for Rahu, he was an even more irrelevant
figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to become
more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A war for the Three
Realms? A struggle between the Nuwa Alliance and the Seamless Gate?
I’ve never cared about such things. Your visions are far too
narrow…your gazes are focused on the Three Realms, but my gaze is
focused on the endless primordial chaos.” Old Man Yuan shook his
head. “I’ve never even considered risking my life in some
squabble here in the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to leave this
place. I want to become even more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because I was born
into the Three Realms, I wasn’t able to acquire any good
techniques. I had no opportunities. Once I leave, I might be able to
become a World God or a Chaos Immortal,” Old Man Yuan said eagerly.
“That’s what I truly want. That’s what I truly desire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti continued to
stare at him coldly. “Selfish! True, compared to the vast
primordial chaos, the Three Realms is a very small place, and we are
indeed nothing more than local bumpkins…but this is our home! The
Three Realms is our home. All of us were born here, and we were all
like brothers. They are now in mortal danger, but you are just going
to stand by and watch? For the sake of becoming a so-called World God
or Chaos Immortal, you are just going to watch as your old friends go
off to fight? Go off to die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never thought that
my old friend Yuan would end up like this.” Subhuti shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” Old
Man Yuan actually began to laugh, laugh so hard that his beard shook.
He then looked towards Subhuti with a dagger-sharp gaze. “Yes, I am
selfish. The path of cultivation is a selfish path to begin with. If
I’m going to walk this path, of course I need to treasure my own
life. Of course I have to seize every opportunity I can find to
become more powerful. Am I supposed to foolishly stand alongside the
rest of you and risk everything?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t possess
any transcendental qualities. Neither we nor the Seamless Gate will
permit you to remain unaligned.” Although Subhuti felt sorrow in
his heart, he still tried to dissuade Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll do everything
I can to get as much as I can from the Seamless Gate,” Old Man Yuan
said calmly. “Don’t worry. Before the Endwar begins, I’ll leave
the Three Realms and enter the endless primordial chaos. I’ll take
my old friends with me, and together we shall adventure through it.
As for what happens to you and the Seamless Gate? I won’t get
involved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave?” Subhuti
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Old Man
Yuan laughed coldly. “What, did you actually think that I would
really fight on behalf of the Seamless Gate? No; neither your side
nor the Seamless Gate is worth me risking my life for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Very good
indeed.” Subhuti laughed hard, as though he had heard an incredibly
funny joke. “During my [Dream of the Three Realms], I can see
countless mortals change…but now, I see that the hearts of
Fiendgods can change as well. You’ve changed. You’ve changed far,
far too much compared to the Yuan who was born alongside me from
within the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, I was
just a newborn. I was born with mastery over a Grand Dao, but aside
from that I knew nothing at all. Back then, we were too simple and
naïve.” Old Man Yuan shook his head. “As far as I’m concerned,
my brothers and friends are of secondary importance. My path of
cultivation is of paramount importance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti gave Old Man
Yuan a long, deep look, then disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Old Man Yuan, he
just continued to sit there quietly. He lifted up one of the wine
cups and took a small sip from it. “Once I become a World God and
look back, all of this will be nothing more than a memory.”

Chapter 18 - Nineteen Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that castle
located deep inside the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike’s
eyes were flashing with dangerous light. The entire hall was
completely silent, and none of his six subordinates dared to make a
sound. Not even the powerful one-armed man dared to say a thing.
Although Godfiend Witherspike rather respected him because they were
on the same general level of power, the one-armed man knew just how
what a terrifyingly demonic figure the Godfiend actually was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was
overconfident!” Godfiend Witherspike growled gutterally to himself.
“I didn’t expect this Ji Ning would actually be able to solve the
riddle of Earthmoan Mountain. That place is a Wokejade Realm! Not
even Ancestral Immortals or Elder Gods should be able to escape it so
quickly. How did a bumpkin like him solve it? He’s trained for less
than a thousand years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I knew this would
happen, I would’ve gone to Earthmoan Mountain in person and waited
for them there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was feeling rather frustrated right now. He had very nearly wiped out
the entire squad of Fiendgods! If he had personally gone to Earthmoan
Mountain and set up an ambush there, he probably would’ve been able
to wipe out Kuafu’s entire squad. However, his arrogance and pride
was bred deep. Those figures were mere True Gods and third-tier
Ancestral Immortals, while he was an exalted Elder God! He had also
roamed the primordial chaos for many years and experienced many
things. He held no respect for these locals whatsoever. Personally
set up an ambush for them? He felt it was beneath him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Three
Realms, there were only two things he was leery of. The first was
whatever Mother Nuwa left behind to her successors before departing.
The second was the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa was a World
God, after all. The ancestral homeland of a World God was never an
easy place to invade, even if that World God had departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Lord of All
Fiends, he was an even more freakish figure who had actually been
able to escape from a World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from these two
concerns, Godfiend Witherspike really wasn’t worried about anything
or anyone else. He had felt that Kuafu’s squad would definitely
die. He had not imagined that Ji Ning was this formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, he couldn’t be
blamed for this oversight. Logically speaking, there was no way
someone like Ji Ning should’ve been able to escape Earthmoan
Mountain in such a short period of time. Alas, Ji Ning had the legacy
of World God Northrest. The techniques he had were all far superior
to the ones which Godfiend Witherspike knew!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well, then.
Your squads wish to ruin my territory, but it won’t be that easy…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was just the
first trap. You were lucky enough to escape…but next time, I won’t
be so careless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
gently tightened the grip of his slender fingers around his right
armrest. Crack! The armrest instantly disintegrated, but moments
later its fragments automatically reformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was completely
silent. Not even Celestial Immortal Blackheaven dared to say a thing.
When Blackheaven had served the Lord of All Things, he had met
Godfiend Witherspike quite a few times. Witherspike was definitely a
figure who was just as terrifying as the Lord of All Things had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousand Mountains
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s group was
travelling alongside Lord Tathagata’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Lord
Tathagata the Buddha smiled as he looked at Ning. “Which of the
four squads do you plan to accompany? You are a human. Technically,
you should follow the squad which the human race sent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he joined us a
long time ago!” Kuafu immediately protested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been working
together for quite some time now. We’re used to each other,”
Xingtian rebutted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empress Xi, Luwu, and
the others all immediately voiced their opposition as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke? Given
how powerful Ji Ning was, how could they possibly be willing to let
him be taken away by another squad?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve always been
on good terms with Kuafu, Xingtian, and the others. There’s no need
to go to the trouble of switching,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly so!” Kuafu
reached out with his big hand, loping it around Ning’s shoulders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Lord Buddha
nodded. “You might as well. Still, don’t get overconfident. The
trap you fell into was just one of many dangers we will encounter in
our campaign against the Primordial Ruinworld. Even more and even
greater dangers await us. You have to be careful. I can dimly sense
that things in the Primordial Ruinworld aren’t as simple as we
thought them to be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We understand,”
Kuafu said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha glanced
carefully at their surroundings, then said, “I imagine that Fuxi
and Jade Cauldron will arrive here soon as well. This really was a
close call. If it wasn’t for Ji Ning, your entire squad probably
would’ve been wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later, all
four squads had gathered together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This close call had
woken them all up to the reality of the situation. During their
previous efforts, they had encountered some dangerous situations as
well, but none of them were truly deadly! This situation, however,
had descended out of nowhere and had been absolutely terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After gathering
together, the four squads started to travel in closer proximity to
each other. They advanced more slowly and more cautiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. In the blink of an eye, nineteen years went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
already covered nearly 90% of the territory of the Primordial
Ruinworld, and they had caused utter devastation to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past
nineteen years, Tathagata, Fuxi, Jade Cauldron, Ning, and the others
had all been extremely cautious. Ning’s display of his sword-arts
had thoroughly convinced Kuafu’s squad of his prowess. He had
faster evasion techniques! More powerful group attacks! More powerful
close combat techniques! A better sense for danger than Daofather
Windfate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had encountered
numerous dangerous situations during the past nineteen years, and
Ning’s dazzling displays of power had firmly cemented his status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because they were
incredibly cautious, not a single member of the four squads had died
during the past nineteen years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, catch.”
Kuafu flung a wine gourd over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated atop a
distant boulder. He reached out to catch the gourd, then raised his
head and took a gulp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
advancing fairly quickly. Jade Cauldron and the others have been a
bit slower than us. Let’s take a rest and wait a while,” Graceful
Peacock said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we’ve
already wrecked more than ninety percent of the Primordial
Ruinworld.” Luwu couldn’t help but laugh. “Although the final
places are rather dangerous, as long as we are careful we should be
able to finish this campaign in another ten or so years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
Empress Xi stood with regal dignity. She said solemnly, “Both Fuxi
and Tathagata have discussed this matter. On the way over, we’ve
encountered multiple dangers. Although none of them were as
terrifying as Earthmoan Mountain, they were still able to see a few
hints of the truth. The Primordial Ruinworld’s true power is
nothing like that we expected.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what do
you think?” Xingtian looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seated on the boulder,
Ning just smiled. “No matter what, we have to keep attacking and
advancing. Let’s just be more careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninteen years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During these nineteen
years, his Primaltwin had remained within the Crescent world,
training inside the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance. The Heavengazer
Tower had been set to internally advance time at a hundred times
normal speed, which meant that he had actually been training for the
equivalent of two thousand years. His sword-arts had become even more
marvelous, and he was slowly becoming even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the castle deep
inside the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve had it too
easy the past few years. None of the bumpkins ended up dying.”
Godfiend Witherspike sat atop his throne, staring down coldly. “Very
well, then. They’ve already entered the Goldriver world. This time,
I shall slay Fuxi and Tathagata in that world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six golden-armored
figures beneath him were all startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven said hurriedly, “Mighty Godfiend Witherspike, although
the Goldriver world is a world which we spent tremendous amounts of
effort over, the Human Emperor and the Lord Buddha are
extraordinarily powerful figures. To slay even one of them will be
very hard. To kill two? I think it might be better to focus on them
one at a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I let Kuafu’s
squad escape last time.” Godfiend Witherspike swept his cold gaze
towards Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, causing Blackheaven’s heart
to shudder. “I no longer have much faith in your so-called
‘formations’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will indeed be
necessary to use them to kill Fuxi and Tathagata, but in the end…it
will be up to me to personally deal with them.” A bloody light
flickered deep within Godfiend Witherspike’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personally?”
Blackheaven was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had thought that the
Godfiend would wait until the Endwar before fighting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Personally.”
Godfiend Witherspike swept his subordinates with his gaze. “Saber,
when the time comes, I might need you to get involved as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
single-armed man bowed with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven felt his
heart shudder. Good heavens. Both Godfiend Witherspike and Saber were
going to strike? Given the formations they had set up around the
Goldriver world…it really was possible that they might be able to
slay Fuxi and Tathagata, a pair of overlord-class figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can inform the
Seamless Gate.” Godfiend Witherspike glanced at Blackheaven.
“However…ideally, the less they know the better. Don’t give the
Nuwa Alliance any chance of finding out about this. This attack of
mine should be able to catch them completely offguard, because they
don’t even know that I exist. But if this attack ends in failure,
it’ll be quite difficult to find another such chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could you
possibly fail, mighty Godfiend?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They will be caught
completely offguard, and they are also weaker than us. We’ve also
made meticulate preparations around the Goldriver world.” The
red-bearded elder hurriedly agreed. “We will definitely win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we are to make a
move, we must ensure it kills them.” Godfiend Witherspike said
calmly, “Head out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The castle instantly
flew into the air and began to move towards the Goldriver world at
high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures within the
castle remained quite calm. Godfiend Witherspike and his six
golden-armored generals had experienced many, many dangers in the
past. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, however, was quite excited. “If
we are able to kill Fuxi and Tathagata…”

Chapter 19 - Critical Danger
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leaders of the
Seamless Gate were all excited upon hearing that Godfiend Witherspike
was making his move. They were waiting eagerly for Witherspike to
slay Fuxi and Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldriver world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the rest of
the seven were resting at a beautifully scenic place. Their squad
included the incredibly fast Kuafu and the shockingly fierce Ji Ning.
They ended up being the squad that fought forward at the fastest
pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to wait a
full day. I’m going to take a nap here.” Luwu chortled as he lay
down onto the grassy ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lazy fellow.”
The nearby Xingtian shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With Kuafu and
Darknorth in our squad, what have I to worry about?” Luwu felt
quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xingtian glanced at
Kuafu, who was drinking some wine as well, as well as the distant Ji
Ning. Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position atop his boulder,
holding a gourd of wine in one hand while experimenting with a few
sword-stances with his other. Ning’s fingers moved like a blur, but
if one paid careful attention to them, one would sense a sword-intent
that was absolutely terrifying. Even Xingtian couldn’t help but
feel his heart shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been praised
as being a ‘god of war’, but Ji Ning has the number one
sword-arts of the Three Realms, and he improves so incredibly fast.”
Xingtian was secretly amazed. “I really can’t compare to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, he had
no idea that Ning’s Primaltwin was located in the Heavengazer
Tower. A day in the outside world meant a hundred days had passed
inside the tower. How could Ning’s sword-arts NOT improve quickly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, Ning spent
more than seventy percent of his time in the Heavengazer Tower
meditating on the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, completely
focusing on just one thing wouldn’t necessarily be ideal. Thus,
Ning would occasionally train in his sword-arts as well as various
divine abilities. He tried to balance his training regime, but even
so his improvement in the sword remained quite astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That nameless
sword-art really is unfathomably profound.” Ning sighed mentally to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
stood at the very peak of power, even amongst World Gods. This was
primarily thanks to the nameless sword-art! He had actually only
acquired Violetjewel later on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nameless sword-art
was truly unfathomable. After mastering it, World God Northrest had
developed ninety-eight sword-arts which he had placed on those
ninety-eight stone steles! Ning could now train in these techniques
without any problems at all, but every time he tried to train in the
nameless sword-art, he found it to be incredibly taxing and difficult
to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, Ning could
tell that the sword-spirit of Violetjewel was correct; he had to
master all ninety-eight sword-arts before he could truly begin to
train in the nameless sword-art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning still did
gain a few minor insights over the course of nearly two thousand
years in the tower as he occasionally meditated on the nameless
sword-art. Those minor insights were enough to allow Ning’s
sword-arts to grow dramatically more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel is
nothing more than a weapon,” Ning mused to himself. “Compared to
Violetjewel, the most important gifts left to me by World God
Northrest were those ninety-eight stone sword-steles and the nameless
sword-art within the jade shrine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to take a
few gulps of wine while practicing his sword-stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
was quite beautiful. The area around them was filled with lovely
grass, but farther away there was only violently shaking regions of
shattered space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld had many regions of distorted spacetime and shattered
space, or strange seas of blood. These things were extremely rare in
the Three Realms, but extremely common here in the Ruinworld. Not
even the creatures who lived here dared to move too close to those
regions. If they were drawn into them, they would quickly die unless
they were strong enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Graceful Peacock suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
All of them turned to look. True God Luwu, who had appeared asleep,
instantly rose to his feet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Kuafu immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graceful Peacock said
hurriedly, “This Goldriver world is fairly dangerous. The squad led
by Lord Buddha has been trapped into a danger zone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Kuafu let out
a sigh of relief, then laughed. “Given how powerful Lord Buddha is,
I trust he’ll be able to handle it himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Windfate
smiled as well, twirling his fan. “Lord Buddha is incredibly
powerful. He’s generally able to easily deal with any dangerous
situations he might encounter. If even he cannot resolve the
situation, the rest of us would be of no use either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Buddha said
that he can deal with it, but he’ll need some time.” Graceful
Peacock nodded. “Lord Buddha’s been trapped in a complicated
formation. There’s no way to destroy it through raw power; the only
option is to slowly solve the formation and deconstruct it. Fuxi’s
squad is moving towards him at high speed to assist him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi’s heading
there as well?” Empress Xi nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone felt relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata was the
leader of the Buddhist Sangha and incredibly skilled in defense. Even
if three or four other overlord-class figures were to simultaneously
assault him, he would be able to hold on for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Fuxi, he was the
number one formations expert of the Three Realms. He was the ideal
candidate for helping Tathagata solve the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s head over
there as well and take a look at what the formation is all about,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go take
a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we won’t
be of much help, we can still take a good look. It’s boring and
pointless just to sit here and wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the seven True Gods were quite relaxed. They immediately soared onto
a cloud and flew towards Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one felt much
concern over the fact that Tathagata’s squad was trapped!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the major
powers located inside the Allclans Palace of the Nuwa Alliance were
concerned. Lord Tathagata himself wasn’t too worried either. In the
past twenty years, they had encountered numerous dangerous situations
in the Primordial Ruinworld. On multiple different occasions, they
had been trapped within a dangerous region for a brief period of
time. In each case, they were able to resolve the situation quite
quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being trapped,
Tathagata had put it this way: “The formation is just a bit
complicated. Once Fuxi arrives, he’ll soon be able to defeat it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had experienced so
many situations like this that they no longer considered it a big
deal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graceful Peacock
laughed. “Fuxi’s already arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long does the
Human Sovereign need in order to break the formation?” Kuafu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi is still
inspecting the formation. Umm…the formation’s a bit complex, but
Fuxi said that he should be able to break it in under an hour.”
Graceful Peacock smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An hour? We might as
well slow down a bit. By the time we get there, the Human Sovereign
and Lord Buddha will probably have just escaped the formation.”
Daofather Windfate laughed. “There’s no point in getting there
early and just waiting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep flying
at our normal speed,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graceful Peacock’s
face suddenly changed. This immediately captured the attention of Ji
Ning, Windfate, Kuafu, Empress Xi, Luwu, and Xingtian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning immediately asked quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a bit of a
problem.” Graceful Peacock frowned. “Something’s wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of her clones were
accompanying Lord Buddha’s squad and Fuxi’s squad, and so she
knew exactly what was happening in each squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
Graceful Peacock called out in shock. “The formation’s completely
changed! Another formation has also appeared outside of the first
formation, and it’s completely trapped Fuxi’s squad inside of it.
Three golden-armored major powers just appeared! We’ve never
encountered these three before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three major powers
we’ve never encountered before? Are they the Four Thearchs?”
Xingtian asked frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, they aren’t
the Four Thearchs.” Graceful Peacock’s face turned even uglier.
“Tathagata’s squad is under attack as well, and other alien
Outsiders have also appeared. A large group of alien Daofathers have
appeared…dozens of them! All of the Daofathers of the Primordial
Ruinworld have appeared and are assaulting them! Fuxi’s been locked
down by those three golden-armored Outsiders. Those three are
incredibly powerful; they’ve completely tied him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move!”
Kuafu immediately bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you
should enter my estate-treasure. Let me lead the way,” Ning barked
right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” None of
them hesitated at all. Ning waved his hand, collecting all six of the
True Gods into his estate-treasure. Ning then transformed into a
black lightning serpent, moving at maximum speed towards the place
where Tathagata had been trapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jade Cauldron’s
squad, which had similarly been relaxing, was notified as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Almost all of
the alien True Gods and Daofathers of the Primordial Ruinworld have
appeared? They are surrounding and attacking Tathagata? The Human
Sovereign’s actually been tied down and won’t be able to
reinforce him?” Daoist Jade Cauldron immediately understood how
ugly the situation had turned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Graceful
Peacock’s faced was covered with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
Daoist Jade Cauldron immediately bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven major powers
of the Daoist Path immediately boarded a boat-type Chaos treasure and
moved at high speed towards the place where Tathagata was trapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although both Ning’s
squad and Jade Cauldron’s squad were worried, the most worried
figures of all were within the Allclans Palace in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this news,
the major powers there immediately knew that things were dire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the True Gods
and Daofathers of the Primordial Ruinworld have appeared…and three
golden-armored figures that we’ve never seen before have appeared
and are capable of tying down Fuxi.” Daoist Three Purities
hurriedly shouted, “The Primordial Ruinworld really was hiding its
true power, but its true power is far more terrifying than what we
expected! Houyi, Suiren, immediately lead squads of True Gods and
Daofathers to go rescue Fuxi and Tathagata!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Houyi
and Suiren both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren was believed by
many to be the most powerful figure in the Nuwa Alliance, while
Houyi’s true power unknown and unfathomable. The two immediately
took command over a group of thirty-six True Gods and Daofathers,
then departed from the Allclans Palace at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graceful Peacock,
after Houyi and Suiren reach the Primordial Ruinworld, it’ll take
them some time to fly over to Tathagata’s location. Have Jade
Cauldron, Kuafu, and Darknorth do their best to try and help Fuxi
defeat those three golden-armored figures,” Daoist Three Purities
hurriedly instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Graceful
Peacock immediately acknowledged.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allclans Palace.
Everyone was in a state of panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three
golden-armored Outsiders that we’ve never seen before have actually
managed to stop Fuxi in his tracks.” Daofather Subhuti frowned.
“Where did such powerful enemies come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was a Human
Sovereign, and he had True Gods and Daofathers in his squad. And yet,
they had all been completely stymied by these three alien Outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such powerful
individuals shouldn’t be completely unknown figures.” Tathagata
laughed calmly. “No need to panic. Although I’m being attacked by
many, my true body is present; although these alien Outsiders are
formidable, they won’t be able to do anything to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daoist
Three Purities nodded. “I feel slightly better that you are the one
trapped there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Tathagata’s
face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
All the major powers in the hall looked towards Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Great Sun Buddha
body has been injured.” Tathagata said in a low voice, and his
customary smile was no longer on his face. Instead, he looked as calm
and tranquil as the deep seas. “I sensed long ago that things in
the Primordial Ruinworld wouldn’t be as simple as we thought them
to be, but…the one-armed golden-armored figure who injured me just
now is definitely no weaker than I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No weaker than you?”
All the major powers in the hall were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata had reached
the overlord level of power back in the Primordial Era, and his
defensive prowess was number one in all the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. He’s
extremely powerful,” Tathagata said softly. “He’s definitely an
overlord. My only option is to focus entirely on defense for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on as long as
you can,” Daoist Three Purities said hurriedly. “Houyi and Suiren
are on the way. Once they get there, this crisis will be resolved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buddha Leafswirl’s
true body has just been destroyed.” Tathagata’s face suddenly
changed yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buddha Leafswirl’s
true body has been destroyed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone cried out in
shock as they turned to look at a woman located in the corner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Leafswirl was an
incredible figure of the Buddhist Sangha. She was born a True God,
and when Tathagata became an overlord-class figure and established
the Buddhist Sangha during the Primordial Era, she had joined him!
When she had seen how much suffering there was amongst the common
people of the Primordial World of Pangu, she had decided to truly
become a mortal herself and join them. She would start as a mortal
and train to become a Buddha from scratch so that she might truly
experience and understood the sufferings of mortals. That way, she
would also be able to better understand the profound mysteries of
Buddhism.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had shattered her
own soul and sent her truesoul to be reincarnated. She had
experienced countless tribulations, but her truesoul was that of a
True God, after all; she had incredibly high talent, and she actually
ended up establishing her own Buddhist school, the ‘Leafswirl
Sect’. She now had the power of an elite Daofather, and she had
both a true body and a Primaltwin. It was her true body that had
ventured into the Primordial Ruinworld for this campaign.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our foe is very
powerful. With a single claw-strike, he was able to break through our
protective formation and slay me,” Buddha Leafswirl said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere in the
palace instantly grew heavy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata said
slowly, “Two terrifyingly powerful Outsiders have appeared. Both
are overlord-class experts. I’ve already stowed Maitreya and the
others into my [Buddha-Realm Within the Palm], and I’m now fighting
off all of these fiends by myself. Given how strong my golden body
is, they won’t be able to do anything to me within a short period
of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata’s
golden body was so formidable that it could be said to be number one
in all the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,”
Daoist Three Purities urged nonetheless. The two of them were the
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism. Upon seeing Tathagata fall into such
dire straits, Daoist Three Purities couldn’t help but feel frantic
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had already
sent out Suiren and Houyi. The remaining forces they could use to
protect the Three Realms were now clearly weaker than before. No
matter what, they had to conserve enough power so that they could
deal with the Seamless Gate. If all of them left the Three Realms,
the Seamless Gate would probably seize the opportunity to completely
destroy the Nuwa Alliance’s foundation and truly take over the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When that happened, the
war for karmic luck would definitely be completely lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve done what we
can. I hope Houyi and Suiren will be able to make it in time.”
Daoist Three Lives let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as they can
make it, there won’t be any problems at all,” Shennong agreed
quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two overlord-class
experts. The Primordial Ruinworld actually has a pair of
overlord-class experts…” Daofather Subhuti shook his head. “And
extremely powerful ones at that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sakyamuni body of
Lord Buddha was seated in the lotus position, golden light radiating
from his body. He had actually manifested a total of eighteen arms,
and those eighteen dazzling golden arms were striking out in every
single direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, the many alien
Outsiders assaulting him were unable to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This weak little
aboriginal has actually managed to train a protective divine ability
to such a level.” The distant Godfiend Witherspike was watching
from afar, his tail slowly swaying in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His protective
divine ability is extremely formidable, and his divine body is
definitely comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit treasure.”
The one-armed man next to him spoke out in agreement. “And his
palm-arts are also quite formidable. They fill the skies and leave no
openings whatsoever! I’m able to occasionally land a saber-blow on
him, but it’s still very hard to injure him. If he completely
focuses on defense…all we can do is exhaust his store of divine
power. Once he is out of divine power, he’ll die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really hate those
with strong protective divine abilities like this.” Godfiend
Witherspike frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are the T’ya
brothers able to hold on?” Godfiend Witherspike suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are skilled in
defense, and the three of them fight as if they were one. When they
join together in their formation, they are easily capable of holding
down Fuxi’s group. Fuxi’s skill mainly lies in formations; he’s
a bit weaker in actual combat,” the one-armed man said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Daoist Jade
Cauldron is about to arrive.” The red-nose elder flew over and
bowed respectfully as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Godfiend
Witherspike nodded. “I almost forgot about Jade Cauldron’s squad
and Darknorth’s squad. Let the Four Thearchs take control over
twelve True Gods and bar their path! Stop Jade Cauldron and
Darknorth’s squads.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a number of True
Gods and Daofathers who had been assaulting Tathagata retreated, the
Four Thearchs amongst them. They headed off to stop Daoist Jade
Cauldron and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance
sent out two overlord-class experts. One is Tathagata, and his
defensive skills are formidable. The other is Fuxi, who is even more
formidable in the art of formations. Both are extremely skilled in
dealing with large groups of attackers.” Godfiend Witherspike
gritted his teeth. If it had been Daoist Three Purities or Suiren,
things would actually have been much easier. Experts skilled in
defense caused quite the headache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Saber, come up with
a method to defeat his palm-arts.” Godfiend Witherspike looked at
the one-armed man. “Let’s join forces to suppress him, then deal
with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
one-armed man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and the one-armed man instantly charged towards Lord Buddha. Lord
Buddha continued to sit there calmly, his eighteen golden arms
blocking attacks frome very direction. He completely focused on
defense. His goal was not to win; it was only to avoid making any
mistakes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, he was
advancing at high speed through the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
technique. However, his squad had been the farthest up ahead; the
entire reason why they had been planning to wait for a day was to
give the other three squads enough time to catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Daoist Jade
Cauldron and his Chaos boat was the first to arrive at Tathagata’s
location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jade Cauldron’s
squad has already arrived.” Graceful Peacock spoke out to Ning from
with his estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. The Four
Thearchs have all appeared, as well as twelve other alien True Gods.
They are able to easily block Jade Cauldron’s path. In fact, they
are actually suppressing him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned upon
hearing this, but there was nothing he could do aside from continuing
to advance at high speed while using the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Four Thearchs were
all elite Daofathers. They also had twelve other alien True Gods
supporting them, while Daoist Jade Cauldron’s team consisted of
just seven individuals! The Four Thearchs would indeed have the power
needed to suppress Daoist Jade Cauldron’s squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, the Four
Thearchs have a total of sixteen in their squad! Jade Cauldron only
has seven, while we only have seven as well. The Four Thearchs have
more than enough power to completely tie our two squads down,”
Xingtian sent mentally. “I think we should move to avoid the Four
Thearchs and instead go assist Fuxi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. Jade Cauldron’s
been surrounded as well; if too much time passes, his squad will also
be in danger of losing their lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu and the others
had become rather frantic as well. The Primordial Ruinworld’s
forces now held the absolute upper hand. Tathagata was in danger,
Fuxi had been tied down, and Jade Cauldron had been surrounded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They hid their true
power quite well. They forebore from striking for a long time, but as
soon as they did they immediately knocked us off-balance.” Ning
mused to himself, “Fortunately, Three Purities and the others were
worried about something like this happening, which is why they sent
Fuxi and Tathagata. Those two are very skilled in defense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata relied on his
powerful body to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi relied on his
formations to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both were very skilled
in delaying and buying time for themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
Graceful Peacock is telling us, two new overlord-class figures have
appeared in the Primordial Ruinworld?” Ning’s eyes flashed with
sharp light. “Weren’t the most powerful figures here supposed to
be those Four Thearchs? Where did these two overlords come from? Such
powerful figures can’t possibly be nameless and unknown…but no
one has any idea as to who they are. They must have come from the
primordial chaos, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alien Outsiders from
the primordial chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple such figures
had invaded during the Primordial Era, but the Three Realms era had
been much more peaceful. Although there had been a few invasions,
those figures had all possessed low levels of strength. They weren’t
as terrifying as Rahu or the Lord of All Things had been. So in
truth, powerful alien Outsiders had arrived long ago! They had simply
chosen to hide within the Primordial Ruinworld instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this divine
sword of mine is going to see blood soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black lightning
serpent streaked through the skies, moving towards the direction of a
major battle. It was a battle between Daoist Jade Cauldron’s group
and the alien Outsiders commanded by the Four Thearchs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Darknorth.
Darknorth has arrived. The six of you, follow me. We’ll stop
Darknorth!” Instantly, two of the Thearchs and six True Gods turned
to charge towards Ning.

Chapter 21 - Overlord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thearch Fusha had
handsome features, a large frame, and a natural aura of dominance.
Thearch Vileye, by contrast, was incomparably ugly. His body was
covered with a layer of thick jade skin, and his body was filled with
countless bulges and bumps. On his forehead, there was a particularly
large bump that had an eye inside of it, and that eye was filled with
endless malevolence. Weaker Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would
probably be instantly dominated by a single glance of that eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me, but be
wary of Darknorth and Kuafu. Be wary of Darknorth in particular; his
sword-arts are extremely powerful,” Thearch Fusha instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The six
figures immediately followed directly behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was flying
through the air, surrounded by his black lightning serpent. He swept
the battlefield with his gaze. In his heart, he was most worried
about Lord Tathagata the Buddha. Based on what Graceful Peacock had
told him, Tathagata was currentingly being assaulted by two
overlord-class figures! Even worse, these were figures that no one
had ever encountered before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two overlord-class
figures…it was entirely possible that the two of them were both
Elder Gods! If they truly did come from the vast primordial chaos,
there was no way for Ji Ning to predict how powerful they might be.
If things went on for too long, Lord Buddha might very well be slain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
alliance with the Primordial Ruinworld meant that they had gained two
more overlord-class figures on their side. Ning’s side, the Nuwa
Alliance, could not afford any more losses!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.” Ning
pointed from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly,
rainbow-colored sword-light began to descend upon the world around
him in an utterly dazzling fashion. Next, the countless rays of
sword-light began to spin together, condensing into a total of nine
rainbow swords. They struck down towards Thearch Fusha and six of the
True Gods like nine rainbow lighting bolts! This scene stunned all of
the major powers present.

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Layers of black
light appeared around Thearch Fusha and the rest of the eight. The
layers of black light whittled away at the power of the
rainbow-colored swords, in the end forcibly halting Ning’s strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, these
aliens of the Primordial Ruinworld have learned some powerful
combination formations. Be careful!” The distant Daoist Jade
Cauldron sent a hurried mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be
careful. All we need to do is keep Darknorth tied down.” Thearch
Fusha and the rest of the eight were all badly frightened as well.
They hadn’t even engaged Ji Ning in close combat yet. They never
would’ve imagined that those nine long-distance strikes would
contain such incredible power! Fortunately, they had been taught
certain things by the Godfiend, and so were able to jointly resist
those attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth is too arrogant. He actually dares to fight against us by
himself. If he had worked together with Kuafu just now, we might’ve
been in a bit of trouble.” Thearch Vileye snickered coldly. “Now
that we have this formation which Master taught us…hmph. Sword
Immortal Darknorth won’t be able to do anything to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt in
midair, frowning as he glanced at the alien Outsiders in front of
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time was very precious
right now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were in a hurry to
go reinforce Fuxi and rescue Tathagata! But now, Daoist Jade Cauldron
had been trapped here. Thanks to the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent],
Ning would indeed be able to move at high speed and circle around
this region, but that would mean Daoist Jade Cauldron’s squad would
be in serious trouble. If more time passed, they might very well die
here. Thus…Ning decided that he might as well spend a bit more
effort here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ning
transformed into a streak of light and charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He still isn’t
having Kuafu and the others come out?” Thearch Vileye and Thearch
Fusha were both startled. “Ji Ning is underestimating us a bit too
much. The only reason he is formidable is because of his swordforce.
It’s not as though he is an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Ning’s
two arms dramatically increased in size, expanding to become more
than three thousand meters long as the tips of his fingers shone with
rainbow-colored sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fall down!” The
vile-looking vertical pupil in Thearch Vileye’s forehead was
staring fixedly at Ning, and an invisible wave of force struck out
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
stared back coldly at these alien Outsiders. He was completely
unaffected. His soul had been nurtured by the power of his half-step
Elder God body. His soul was so powerful that it would probably rank
within the top three of the entire Three Realms! His heartforce was
at the fourth stage as well! In fact, Ning had also learned a
heartforce soul-locking technique from World God Northrest. How could
an innate domination technique like this possibly shake his soul?
Even if it was a hundred times more powerful, it wouldn’t be able
to do anything to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two elongated
arms were like a pair of extremely long spears!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s palms pierced
straight through the layers of black light surrounding the two
Thearchs and the other six! The Thearchs had felt as though Ning’s
palms were quite far away, but in the next instant the two palms had
already pierced through the protective black light. The attack was
simply too fast; it had completely surpassed the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had distilled the
best aspects of many different sword-arts to create the most
penetrative stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art: Blood Drop Stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning’s power as
a half-step Elder God and his terrifying sword-arts, the power of
this blow was so great that it arguably had reached the apex of power
in the Three Realms! Although Ning’s palms had merely been trained
to the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], it was still more than
enough when dealing with these alien Outsiders of the Primordial
Ruinworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Thearchs and
the six True Gods were completely scared silly. Their first
reaction…was to flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an instinctive
desire, separate from all conscious thought!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two massive palms
that had pierced through their formation were like a pair of metal
hammers smashing together! They were like a pair of enormous
stormclouds that were joining together in a tremendous clap,
capturing the terrified Thearchs and the True Gods between them.
Agonized, terrified cries rang out as the ten tried to flee…but
alas, how could they possibly move as fast as Ning’s palms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two massive palms
clapped together violently in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True Gods and
Daofathers were completely destroyed, their bodies transformed into
dust and their truesouls destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but…” The
distant Daoist Jade Cauldron and his squad were dazed by what they
had just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had battled
against these alien Outsiders for quite some time now, and they knew
exactly how tough and durable that formation was. They had yet to
find a way to penetrate the formation, but Ji Ning had managed to
shatter it through just his hands? In fact, he had clapped to death
those eight True Gods in an instant! Thearch Fusha and Thearch
Vileye, two incredibly tough foes, were amongst their ranks as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee right away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an overlord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an Elder
God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other alien True
Gods and Daofathers who had been battling Daoist Jade Cauldron were
completely scared senseless. Thearch Darkstill and the other Thearch
no longer had their usual composure; their only thing on their face
was utter terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee?” Ning, who
had just wiped out those eight True Gods, turned his head to look
towards them. Swoosh! He transformed into a black lightning serpent
and charged towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee in different
directions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Split up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t hesitate
at all. They didn’t even dare to think of using their formation to
defend against Ji Ning’s attacks. They immediately split apart,
fleeing in different directions. Their formation naturally dissipated
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt. He
stood there in midair, staring at the eight True Gods that were
fleeing in every which way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
pointed his finger towards the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies turned dark,
and streams of rainbow-colored sword-light began to appear in the
area around them. The entire region became a world of rainbow
sword-light. This caused the fleeing Thearchs and True Gods to reveal
looks of horror on their faces, especially Thearch Darkstill. He had
sent his nine bugbeasts against Ning, and they had all been wiped out
by this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dazzling rainbow
sword-light unfolded like the blooming of a flower, shooting out in
every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was beautiful and
dazzling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! ……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Peacock, a stance
meant for slaughter. Six of the eight alien Daofathers were instantly
slain. The two Thearchs managed to resist for a brief moment, but in
the end even they found it difficult to resist the consecutive
strikes of rainbow sword-light from Sword Peacock. One was
disintegrated, while the other, Thearch Darkstill, was able to
survive thanks to his defensive skills. However, he was still heavily
injured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The black
lightning serpent flashed past him, and as it did his head went
flying, eyes still filled with a look of celebration at having
‘survived’ Sword Peacock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world turned
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen alien True
Gods had all been slain! The distant Daoist Jade Cauldron, Chijingzi,
Holy Mother Turtlesoul, and others all stared blankly. Sixteen True
Gods and Daofathers…they had all been wiped out in such a short
period of time, and in such a completely overwhelming fashion. This
sort of power…there was only one explanation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an overlord?”
Old man Chijingzi murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Daofathers by
his side all shivered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Overlord?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They stared at the
distant white-robed youth, the ordinary-looking kid. He was an
overlord?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth? He’s reached the overlord level?” Daoist Jade Cauldron
still couldn’t believe it. None of the seven really could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their hearts…Ji
Ning was just a lovesick man who was exceedingly talented. In truth,
they felt quite a bit of pity towards Ji Ning. They knew of his
history, and they also knew that his wife ‘Yu Wei’ had been a spy
for the Seamless Gate. In fact, Yu Wei’s betrayal during the
Crimsonbright Realmwar had very nearly caused them to lose that
Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost everyone in the
Three Realms knew that during the battle in the Deerchaser world, the
black-robed Godking had personally crushed Yu Wei’s truesoul! None
of them could forget the agonized howl of rage which Ji Ning had
unleashed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their hearts,
whenever they thought of Ji Ning, they would at most sigh to
themselves and say, “What a pitiable man. He is a genius, but alas
the war arrived too soon for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what many
believed, including many of the major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, even Ning’s
own master, Subhtui, often mused to himself that it truly was a pity
that Ji Ning had been born so late. If he had been born just a few
years earlier, he might’ve stood a good chance of reaching Houyi’s
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pitiable man with a
pitiable life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These feelings of
commiseration and pity were what most major powers felt when they
faced Ning.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them ever would
have imagined that this poor youth who had suffered so many setbacks
would have climbed up to the apex of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The apex of the Three
Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peak of power
amongst all the cultivators of the entire Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A position which only
the likes of Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Daoist Three Purities, Human
Sovereign Suiren, Human Sovereign Fuxi, Human Sovereign Shennong, and
the inconceivably talented Houyi had reached. But now, yet another
figure had appeared by their side…this ordinary-looking white-robed
youth who stood before them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth! Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world just
changed,” Holy Mother Turtlesoul said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it has changed.
Yet another overlord-class figure has appeared in the Three Realms.”
Daoist Jade Cauldron said softly, “And he’s trained for less than
a thousand years. He’s an absolute legend, a legend which surpasses
even that of Houyi’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Daofathers
present all felt a bit dizzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had just watched a
legend be born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth had trained for
less than a thousand years to journey from the ranks of mortals to
the very apex of the Three Realms! He ranked above all other
cultivators and stood side-by-side with Daoist Three Purities, Lord
Buddha, and the Three Sovereigns of Mankind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
looked at them and said quickly, “Lord Tathagata is in a perilous
situation right now. We have to go reinforce Fuxi right away and come
up with a way to rescue Lord Tathagata. Let me draw you into my
estate-treasure for now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Daoist
Jade Cauldron and the others couldn’t help but comply. When facing
an overlord, they unconsciously assumed the role of followers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. With a
wave of his hand, he drew Daoist Jade Cauldron and the others into
his estate-treasure, then transformed into a black lightning serpent
and flew at high speed towards Fuxi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the formation
trapping Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The incomparably ugly,
green-skinned Thearch Vileye was sending frantic mental message.
“Master, almighty Master, we’re in trouble! In trouble!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Godfiend
Witherspike was currently working alongside Saber to deal with Lord
Buddha. Upon hearing these words, he immediately turned his head to
glance backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead! All dead!”
Thearch Vileye said frantically, “I’m the only one who survived
because I was born with two bodies. I lost one of my lives! Darkstill
and the others, all of them are dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? How? Fuxi has
been tied down by the T’ya brothers, while Tathagata is in front of
us. Who killed them?!” Godfiend Witherspike was quite unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had trapped
Tathagata in one of the most dangerous parts of the Goldriver world.
Anyone from outside the Primordial Ruinworld would need to spend a
considerable amount of time flying before arriving at this place! The
reinforcements from the Nuwa Alliance wouldn’t be arriving any time
soon. The only possible reinforcements would be the squads of
Darknorth and Daoist Jade Cauldron, but the strongest members of
those squads were merely close to the overlord level. There was no
way they could possibly kill the group of True Gods commanded by the
Four Thearchs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was Darknorth.”
Thearch Vileye said hurriedly, “It was Sword Immortal Darknorth.
He’s terrifyingly powerful. In the face of his power, our
combination formation was far too weak. His hands easily pierced
through our formation, then slaughtered all eight of us. The eight
led by Darkstill are all dead as well. They must’ve died to Ji Ning
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WHAT?!” Godfiend
Witherspike’s face instantly changed. He was no fool. He
immediately knew what this meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another
individual with the power of an Elder God has appeared?” Godfiend
Witherspike frowned deeply. “These aboriginals don’t have any
good cultivation techniques. This Ji Ning should merely have trained
to the True God level! He’s merely a True God, yet he is able to
unleash the power of an Elder God, and he’s trained for less than a
thousand years…even in the endless primordial chaos, it’s hard to
find a genius like this. This is trouble. Yet another problematic
figure has arisen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,
understood!” Godfiend Witherspike barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-yes!” Thearch
Vileye hurriedly slunk back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
waved his hand, causing Celestial Immortal Blackheaven to appear next
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty Godfiend,
have you slain Tathagata?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven asked
eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some very bad
news for you,” Godfiend Witherspike said. “Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning…he already has the power of an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what did you just
say?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’s mind went blank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did I stutter?”
Godfiend Witherspike said angrily, “Ji Ning. The Ji Ning your
people kept on toying with? He already has the power of an Elder God.
Or, to put it in words you people might understand, he has the power
of an overlord! Those idiots in your Seamless Gate…don’t they
know that there are some geniuses that you can’t simply beat down?
You need to avoid causing trouble for them! Yes, some will end up
being destroyed, but others…the more you beat them down, the more
terrifyingly powerful they will become. You utter imbeciles! You
absolute imbeciles!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning has
trained for less than a thousand years. If you had completely ignored
him and paid him no mind, if you had simply let him live a happy life
with his wife, how could he possibly have become so powerful so soon?
He’s now on the same level of power as I am! Another enemy of such
power…I don’t give a damn about who wins this war between you and
the Nuwa Alliance, but you are causing problems for me now! This bone
is getting harder and harder to chew by the day. The Seamless Gate is
a pack of fools. Idiots. Imbeciles! MORONS!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was still mumbling to himself in a daze. “Ji Ning?
Overlord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t lying
to me, right?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When things were in
perfect balance, a tiny change could have an enormous impact, like
the proverbial last straw that broke the camel’s back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a new overlord to
suddenly appear at a time like this…the impact this would have on
the war would be simply enormous. It was ten times more important
than the outcome of the battle for the Deerchaser world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think I’d lie
to you?” Godfiend Witherspike laughed coldly. “All four of the
Thearchs under my command, aside from Thearch Vileye who was born
with two bodies, have been wiped out. It was Ji Ning who killed
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have the Seamless
Gate hurry up and come up with an idea!” Godfiend Witherspike waved
his hand and put away the still-dazed Celestial Immortal Blackheaven.
After doing so, he once more turned his attention to Lord Tathagata
the Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha was using
all his power to defend against the one-armed man. The two seemed to
be on equal footing; the one-armed man’s saber-light carried
utterly ruinous power, while Lord Buddha’s defense was completely
airtight and seamless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth has become
an overlord?” Lord Tathagata the Buddha began to laugh.
“Ahahaha…the Heavens truly favor our side!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavens my ass. A
chaosworld is nothing more than the manifestations of the Worldheart
that lies in its center. ‘Heavens’? Heavens my ass. Stupid
bumpkins.” Godfiend Witherspike sneered coldly. “It doesn’t
mater. A new overlord might have appeared, but he is definitely
inexperienced and new to this level of power. If I can wipe out your
Sakyamuni body, it’ll be enough to make up for the danger which Ji
Ning poses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking,
Godfiend Witherspike once more attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha had been
able to fight on fairly even footing against the one-armed man, but
now Witherspike joined in once more. The fight instantly became
uneven, and Lord Buddha had to use all of the divine abilities and
techniques he had in order to defend against the assaults of these
two alien Outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to fight at
full power in order to withstand these two, but in doing so my divine
power is going to be depleted far too quickly. Almost half of it is
already gone. It seems that I really am going to die here. Still, for
Ji Ning to actually make a breakthrough is cause for celebration.”
Lord Tathagata remained quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Godfiend Witherspike
was cursing at Blackheaven, Ji Ning had already reached Fuxi’s
location while riding his black lightning serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning came to
a halt and stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance, he
could see an enormous hemispherical formation that covered an area of
several million kilometers. Within the sealed area, one could see
Fuxi’s group battling against three muscular golden-armored
figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched out his
hand. A Darknorth sword appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately charged
downwards, transforming into a streak of light as he attacked the
sealing formation. His sword stabbed straight through it. Boom! The
entire sealing formation was immediately pierced through, allowing
Ning to charge inside. As he did so, the hole he had just created
closed up behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was commanding
three human experts in a wild battle against the three muscular
golden-armored figures. However, the three were protected by layers
of watery light that were actually capable of repulsing all attacks.
Even though they were occasionally wounded, the wounds would quickly
close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” When
Fuxi’s group of four saw Ji Ning appear, they couldn’t help but
reveal looks of excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful,” Fuxi
instructed. “These three alien Outsiders have a special combination
formation. There are three of them, but it is as though they are a
single unit! And they are simply unkillable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a look, then
instantly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Waterian race?”
Ning murmured to himself. World God Northrest had transmitted a great
deal of information regarding the primordial chaos to Ning. He
immediately recognized that these three alien Outsiders belonged to
the Waterian race. Waterians were notoriously difficult to deal with,
and in fact they were often described as having indestructible
bodies! They were clearly just a trio of True Gods, but they still
managed to completely tie down Fuxi’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have Kuafu and the
others arrived as well?” Fuxi said hurriedly, “Have your squad
help out right away. Help me tie down these three alien Outsiders so
that I can focus on solving this formation. Tathagata’s situation
is quite grim; if too much time passes, he probably won’t be able
to hold on for much longer. Remember, all you need to do is tie them
down; they are very tough to kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they came.
Leave these three to me.” Ning waved his hand and a group of
figures appeared next to him. Aside from Kuafu’s squad, there was
also Daoist Jade Cauldron’s squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jade Cauldron
arrived as well?” Fuxi instantly smiled. “Wonderful. If the two
of you join forces, you’ll be more than strong enough to deal with
those three alien Outsiders.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Fuxi looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you skilled
in using fire, Human Sovereign?” Ning sent mentally, “So long as
you use your Eternal Kindlefire against them, they will immediately
retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words were
correct. The Waterians were creatures formed from water. They had
incredibly durable bodies; even if you cut them apart, they would
just reform like water without using up my divine power. This was why
they were described as having ‘indestructible bodies’. However,
this sort of innate ability came with its own drawbacks as well.
There were three ways by which one could deal with Waterians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was to use
overwhelming power. A World God could easily blast them apart and
grind them into dust, leaving nothing behind at all! However, Ji Ning
and the others clearly couldn’t use this method right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second method was
to repeatedly attack and injure them. If you injured them heavily
enough and often enough, they would still eventually use up all of
their energy. At some point, the three Waterians would no longer be
able to hold on. However, this method required a very long period of
time, and time was exactly what Ning and the others did not have.
Lord Tathagata the Buddha wouldn’t be able to hold out for much
longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…the only method
remaining was the third method.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterians were
completely water-aligned lifeforms. One could use fire to counter
them! They were terrified of fire. However, the more powerful a
Waterian, the more resistant the Waterian would be to fire. True God
Waterians were generally immune to ordinary skyfire or truefire; one
would have to use something on the level of Golden Solarfire.
Suiren’s ‘Eternal Kindlefire’ was another type of fire that
would work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal Kindlefire
is useful against them?” Fuxi wasn’t that skilled in using this
type of fire. His ‘Waterflame Apocalypse Formation’ used ‘Eternal
Kindlefire’ alongside ‘Arcane Moonwater’. Suiren provided the
Eternal Kindlefire while Fuxi was able to harvest Arcane Moonwater
himself. Thanks to his mastery over the Heavenly Daos of Yin and
Yang, he was able to control both the Kindlefire and the Moonwater,
but this formation was mainly used for extremely wide-area attacks;
it wasn’t that useful against individual opponents, which was why
he hadn’t used it yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although puzzled, Fuxi
trusted Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi and his Daofathers
actually held the upper hand in this fight; the issue was just that
they couldn’t force the three golden-armored Outsiders into
submission. Fuxi suddenly let out a low growl, and as he did a
massive formation suddenly appeared that was hundreds of kilometers
across. The Arcane Moonwater was placed off one side and the Eternal
Kindlefire was placed directly before their foes. The flames looked
warm and inviting, almost like ordinary flames; they didn’t look as
dominating or savage as Golden Solarfire. They were flames that
brought warmth to one’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the flames
appeared, the faces of the three alien Outsiders instantly changed.
When the flames touched one of them, he let out a shocked cry.
“Elderfire! Quick, flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three
golden-armored Outsiders no longer dared to tarry. Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! They immediately transformed into three streaks of watery
light that disappeared into the distance. Fuxi and the others wished
to stop them, but the watery streams were formless, shapeless, and
moved at incredible speed. They instantly scurried back into large
formation off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I knew how afraid
of fire they were, I would’ve used Eternal Kindlefire long ago.”
Fuxi willed the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation to disperse. This was
a formation which he had prepared for the war; he would use it to
attack large groups of opponents. When activated, it would blanket an
entire major world with enough power to cause even elite Daofathers
to feel grave danger. But of course, against overlord Daofathers it
would just prove to be a bit troublesome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They aren’t afraid
of ordinary flames,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the primordial
chaos, flames were divided into three levels of power: Skyfire,
truefire, and elderfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elderfire consisted of
some of the most ancient types of fire! Golden Solarfire and Eternal
Kindlefire were both on this level. The term ‘elderfire’ didn’t
really exist in the Three Realms as practitioners in the Three Realms
only knew of three types of fire on that level; Eternal Kindlefire,
Golden Solarfire, and Zhurong Godfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, since there
were many ways to cultivate and understand the Dao, there were many
different ways to produce elderfire. If every person gave their own
elderfire a special name, there would be an endless number of them.
In the Three Realms, these three types of elderfire all had unique
names, but in the endless primordial chaos they were all simply
referred to as ‘elderfire’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Advancing beyond
elderfire meant making a truly fundamental change. The flames would
return to their original, purest form: chaosfire. Generally speaking,
only World Gods and Chaos Immortals were capable of controlling
chaosfire. A few incredibly talented Elder Gods or Ancestral
Immortals would be capable of controlling it, but by far the vast
majority were not. To find such a monstrous genius would be a
thousand times more difficult than finding Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Fuxi
suddenly stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve reached the
overlord level of power?” Fuxi stared at Ning in shock and delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allclans Palace of
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
become a hubbub of commotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graceful Peacock,
don’t make jokes like that!” The seated Patriarch Subhuti was
badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Graceful
Peacock. That’s not something you can just randomly claim. To be
‘close to the overlord level’ and to be ‘at the overlord level’
are two completely different concepts. Ji Ning is extraordinarily
powerful, but don’t mistake that for him actually being an
overlord-level figure.” Exalted Celestial Carefree no longer looked
as laidback and carefree as usual. Instead, he looked excited as he
nagged at Graceful Peacock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the major powers
in the Allclans Palace were staring at Graceful Peacock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graceful Peacock’s
words are correct.” Close to her was Daofather Chijingzi. “I,
Jade Cauldron, and the rest of our group all saw it for ourselves. Ji
Ning is definitely much more powerful than all seven of us combined.
Two Thearchs and six True Gods joined together into a formation, and
the seven of us were unable to break the formation apart. Darknorth,
however, was able to pierce it with his bare hands and kill all eight
of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed eight True
Gods?” All the major powers were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just that. When
the other eight True Gods who were attacking us saw what had
happened, they immediately tried to flee…but Darknorth still killed
them all.” Chijingzi shook his head. “Sixteen True Gods, with the
Four Thearchs amongst their ranks. In a brief period of time,
Darknorth slaughtered them all with ease. From this day forth…the
Four Thearchs of the Primordial Ruinworld will be nothing more than
an old legend. Oh, wait; I heard that Thearch Vileye has a second
body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire palace was
silent for a moment as the major powers all exchanged glances. Then,
yet another storm of noise erupted as quite a few major powers spoke
out to ask more questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” A voice
rang out, and all the major powers turned to look. It was Lord
Tathagata the Buddha, who sat at the very highest position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is indeed at
the overlord level of power.” Lord Buddha nodded. “I can still
hear that alien Outsider leader screaming and raving about it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations.”
Lord Buddha looked towards Subhuti. “You’ve gained yet another
overlord-class figure under your tutelage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti laughed
delightedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi had already been
extremely powerful when he had joined Subhuti. Although they framed
it as him taking on Subhuti as his master, in truth he was just
hiding himself within Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Ji Ning who had
been truly trained by Subhuti. Subhuti had always held Ji Ning’s
talent for the sword in high regard. Although Ji Ning had advanced
considerably in heartforce, Subhuti had always felt that Ji Ning was
still more talented in the sword. And indeed…Ji Ning had reached
the fifth stage of swordforce, then became an overlord-level figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he was able to
tear apart that formation with his bare hands, he’s probably become
a True God.” Daoist Three Purities laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. If he’s
become a Daofather, there would’ve been a resonance with the
Heavenly Daos. He must have become a True God.” Subhuti laughed as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He trained less than
a thousand years, advancing from being an ordinary mortal to become
an overlord. Incredible, simply incredible.” Shennong sighed in
amazement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major powers
seated below them revealed looks of amazement and joy. Their side had
just gained yet another overlord; how could they not be delighted?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they were stunned
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a few figures had
ever stood at the very peak of power in the Three Realms. In the Nuwa
Alliance, the only figures had been the two leaders of Daoism and
Buddhism, the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, and great divinity Houyi.
But now, yet another person had arisen to stand by their side…a
Sword Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Pangu had
established Heaven and Earth, there had never been a Sword Immortal
who could reach such heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju was very
famous and was once acknowledged as the number one Sword Immortal of
the Three Realms, but he only held the same level of status as
Subhuti. World God Northrest had been focused on keeping himself
alive, after all, and he truly was quite weak compared to his true
level of power; he wouldn’t even dare to fight against Mother Nuwa.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfather Darklight,
Daofather Holyflame, and the other Sword Immortals were even weaker
than Daofather Fuju!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Chaosworld,
the Seamless Chaosworld, the Three Realms…none of them had ever
produced a Sword Immortal which stood at the very apex of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Sword Immortal had
risen up to stand at the very peak of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth! Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth.” Many of the major powers in the palace were all
murmuring softly to themselves. A sense of dread and respect arose in
their hearts, a natural dread that one would feel towards those that
were more powerful than one’s self!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the major
powers would casually refer to Ning as ‘Ji Ning’. Now, however,
they no longer dared to do so. They would now respectfully refer to
him by his Daoist title of ‘Darknorth’. Only those who were very
close to Ning, such as Subhuti, or those who were extremely powerful,
such as Daoist Three Purities and Tathagata, would continue to
address Ning by his given name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood at the
same lofty heights as Three Purities, Suiren, Tathagata, and the
other overlords!

Chapter 24 - Ripping Open the Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiends World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Overlord
level?” The black-robed Godking couldn’t believe it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you say
last time that he was just ‘close’ to the overlord level, thanks
to his fifth-stage swordforce? It’s only been a few years. How did
he suddenly reach the overlord level?” The black-robed Godking felt
as though a ball of fire was raging in his stomach, making him feel
quite miserable. He barked, “Blackheaven, are you sure about this?
Are you sure you weren’t just seeing things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven couldn’t even be bothered to look at the black-robed
Godking. Instead, he said solemnly and respectfully towards the Lord
of All Fiends, “Master, Godfiend Witherspike is quite angry. Ji
Ning is indisputably at the overlord level of power already. Master,
what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indisputably?” The
black-robed Godking ground his teeth when he heard this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Damn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How…how…how did
this kid who had trained for less than a thousand years suddenly rise
to the very apex of the Three Realms? Even he, the exalted disciple
of the Lord of the Demonheart and the nominal leader of the Seamless
Gate, had yet to reach that level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You imbecile.”
Daomother Devilhand glanced sideways at the black-robed Godking,
smiling coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the words
‘you imbecile’, the black-robed Godking snapped out of his daze.
He had always played with the hearts of others, but this time he had
played himself. He had watched as Ji Ning grew powerful, and he had
personally acted to deliver one setback after another to Ji Ning.
Now, Ji Ning had advanced to the very apex of the Three Realms…and
indeed, the Godking’s role in this could not be overstated. How
could the Godking not feel miserable and stifled? However, he was an
extraordinary figure as well. He quickly recovered from his momentary
fugue state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord, Darknorth
has already become an overlord-class power. He trains much too
quickly. We have to get rid of him right away,” the black-robed
Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” The Lord
of All Fiends frowned. “I heard that Houyi, Suiren, and a group of
True Gods and Daofathers have already headed out. Even if we want to
intervene, we would have to first travel to the Goldriver world, then
slowly fly to the battle site. We probably won’t be able to to
catch up to Houyi’s group. We won’t be able to help.
Blackheaven…tell Godfiend Witherspike that we won’t be able to
make it in time. There’s nothing we can do. It will all be up to
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Blackheaven nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell him this as
well,” the Lord of All Fiends instructed, “Kill as many as he
can. He should still do his best to kill Tathagata as soon as
possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,”
Blackheaven said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was silent for a moment, then said softly, “The roots of the Nuwa
Alliance truly are deep…we haven’t been able to force them to
reveal their full power, but we ended up creating a Ji Ning for them.
Godfiend Witherspike…hmph. This alien Outsider has a belly full of
bad plans. Let him fight it out with the Nuwa Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldriver world.
Outside the grand formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi stared at Ning in
delight. He immediately said, “No time to chat about that for now.
For you to make your breakthrough at a time like this is proof that
Heaven is on our side. Tathagata’s used up too much of his divine
power; he won’t be able to hold on for much longer. We have to
immediately break into the formation and rescue him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation is
quite complicated.” Ning stared at the formation before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Fuxi nodded.
“If we slowly take our time to analyze it and deconstruct it, we’ll
need roughly an hour. By then, Tathagata would be long dead.” Fuxi
continued, “Tathagata is an extremely important member of our
alliance. If his true body is destroyed, we’re going to be in
trouble during the Endwar. No matter what, we have to save him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you need me
to do?” Ning immediately asked. Although he knew a bit regarding
formations, compared to Fuxi he was like a completely ignorant child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In order for a
formation to remain intact, it has to remain stable,” Fuxi said.
“If a formation is destabilized, it can easily collapse. It is
reliant on outside power, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood this principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over there.” Fuxi
pointed towards the distance. Instantly, a strand of divine power
flew out towards that part of the formation. “That’s one of the
critical parts of the formation. I need you to do your best to tear
the formation open at that point. Tear it open as widely as you can,
using your full power. This will place an enormous amount of stress
on the formation, making it much easier for me to deconstruct it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately flew
towards that location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body instantly
expanded in size, transforming from an ordinary white-robed youth to
a massive giant that was thirty thousand meters tall. At the same
time, Ning manifested his [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique. His six
arms simultaneously stretched out, causing six sharp swords to appear
within them. He then stabbed forward violently, using the ‘Blood
Drop Stance’ of the [Brightmoon] sword-art. His swords stabbed out
towards the formation faster than the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation was
incredibly tough. When Ning’s six arms struck out, he could sense a
powerful repulsive force pushing him back. This was a formation which
Godfiend Witherspike had designed to trap Tathagata and kill him. To
forcibly break it open…there was no one in the Three Realms capable
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Fuxi
didn’t ask for Ning to do that. All he asked Ning to do was disturb
and disrupt it! Once the formation grew unstable, it would be much
easier for Fuxi to deconstruct it…but despite that, only an
overlord-level figure would be capable of ‘merely’ disrupting the
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, go
assist Darknorth,” Fuxi hurriedly barked. “Attack the same part
of the formation which Darknorth is attacking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” “Alright.”
“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu’s squad and
Daoist Jade Cauldron’s squad immediately joined together into their
respective formations and began to launch waves of attacks against
the formation. The three humans under Fuxi’s command also began to
help out with attacks as well. However, they remained close to Fuxi,
protecting him as he focused his complete attention on the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
felt that things had become a bit easier. Gritting his teeth, he let
out a low snarl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His six swords tore at
the formation, ripping a small tear into the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tear was large
enough for a person to enter, but there was no point in doing so. The
formation was filled with many layers of dangers; one had to destroy
the entire thing before entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi ignored all else
and completely focused on breaking the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata was on the
verge of collapse, with less than a tenth of his divine power left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did these two
Outsider overlords come from? They are incredibly powerful. This
truly is a tribulation…and the true face of the tribulation is
gradually beginning to show itself. I expect that we’ll only
understand the cause of it at the very end,” Tathagata mused to
himself, sighing silently. Only at the end of the war which ended the
Primordial Era had they learned that it was the Lord of All Things
who had instigated everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time…things were
still early, but two alien Outsiders who were overlord-class figures
had already appeared. This caused Tathagata to feel truly worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His defensive skills
were formidable. In the Three Realms, he was capable of withstanding
attacks from three overlords at the same time! Right now, he was
currently facing just two Outsider overlords, but he was at the verge
of being defeated. Clearly, these two alien Outsiders had incredibly
powerful attacks, far more so than the overlords of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Godfiend
Witherspike suddenly frowned. “Why is the formation beginning to
fail…?” He was in control of the formation. He could clearly
sense that one of the critical parts of the formation was rapidly
beginning to fail. If this continued, it would soon completely
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master!”
The three golden-armored Waterians suddenly appeared. One of them
said hurriedly, “That human, ‘Darknorth’, has transformed to
become thirty thousand meters tall. He’s tearing at the formation
to help Fuxi deconstruct our formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tearing at the
formation?” Godfiend Witherspike instantly understood. It was much
easier to deconstruct a destabilized formation. He immediately said,
“Saber, hurry up and go stop Ji Ning from disrupting the formation.
Without Ji Ning helping him out, it’ll take Fuxi a long period of
time before he can solve the formation. Leave Tathagata to me; given
how fast his divine power is being used up, I imagine he should run
dry soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
one-armed man didn’t hesitate. He merely nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He immediately
flew away at high speed, charging towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
turned his head to stare at Tathagata, still seated in the lotus
position. He let out a cold laugh. “Tathagata, your human race has
gained a new overlord, ‘Darknorth’, but it is useless. Saber has
gone to deal with Ji Ning. Without Ji Ning’s help, Fuxi won’t be
able to break the formation in time. By the time he does, you will be
long dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha continued
to use all of his divine abilities, striving to resist Godfiend
Witherspike’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and Saber were both extremely powerful. Both were Elder Gods, after
all! Lord Buddha was only a True God; he was only able to resist them
when using many divine abilities, secret arts, and ultimate attacks.
Now that Saber had left, things were a bit easier for Tathagata.
Still…with only a tenth of his divine power left, he was still
going to die soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaargh!” The
titanic Ji Ning once more struck out with his six arms, his hands
covered with rainbow light as he furiously tore at the opening he had
created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Darknorth.
Tathagata said that a saber-wielding Outsider is heading your way,”
Graceful Peacock sent hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just moments after
Graceful Peacock’s message, Ning saw a one-armed golden-armored
figure appear. The one-armed man quickly grew in size, also becoming
thirty thousand meters tall. This was a grim-looking man that looked
just like a human. He held a saber in his hand as he stared at Ning.
Taking a single step forward, he appeared in front of Ning then
chopped down with the saber in his hand. His saber flashed fiercely,
carrying an aura of irresistible power as it hacked down towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had two choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was to
continue tearing at the formation. The second was to give up on that
and instead focus on blocking the saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!” Kuafu,
Graceful Peacock, Jade Cauldron, and the others who were helping out
from afar all called out in shock. This was because when the
saber-light reached Ning’s body, he continued to focus on tearing
at the formation, completely ignoring the saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sharp blade
chopped down upon his Ning’s divine body, it tore his white robes
apart. Sparks flew from the surface of Ning’s skin, and a hint of a
white impression could be seen…but the saber hadn’t even been
able to penetrate Ning’s skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Ning did was to
give the one-armed man a cold look.
</P>

Chapter 25 - Golden Statue
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The saber was merely
able to leave a white mark on Ji Ning’s chest, but the amount of
power it contained was quite shocking. It caused Ji Ning to be
knocked backwards, but because he was holding onto the tear in the
formation, he was able to borrow from the power of the blow.
Riiiiiip. The tear in the formation actually grew larger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-h-how is this even
possible?” The one-armed man was dazed. “Didn’t they say that
he’s been training for less than a thousand years? Didn’t he just
recently break through to become a True God? How could his divine
body be comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A body that was
comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic treasure…there no was no way
the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] could accomplish this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Three
Realms…the only person to ever accomplish this was Lord Tathagata
the Buddha. Tathagata’s golden body was comparable to a top-grade
Protocosmic treasure, which was why when Saber and Godfiend
Witherspike occasionally managed to land a blow on him, they weren’t
able to injure him at all! This was why their plan had been to
suppress him, then seal him away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, Ji Ning’s
divine body had also reached the same level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just a local
aboriginal. He actually…actually…” The one-armed man’s heart
was quivering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Jade Cauldron,
Fuxi, and the others watching from afar were all shocked as well.
“When that Outsider overlord landed a saber-blow against Darknorth,
he only managed to leave a small white mark on his body?” All of
the spectators had incredible vision. When they saw the one-armed man
attack, they could sense how terrifyingly powerful the strike was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata himself had
said long ago that the Primordial Ruinworld had two overlords in it.
One was a one-armed saber wielder, while the other had a tail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself was quite
calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had just recently
broken through to become a True God, of course he would not have been
able to withstand that blow. However…for him, nearly two thousand
years had gone past!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
himself was a Fiendgod Body Refiner. He was also a member of the
incredibly powerful Vastheaven Palace. In terms of personal strength,
he stood at the very peak of power amongst World Gods as well! There
was an enormous difference in power between the weakest World Gods
and the most powerful World Gods, much like how there was an enormous
difference in power between third-tier True Immortals and first-tier
True Immortals. As an ancient expert who had received many teachings
from his powerful sect, and as a figure who was capable of acquiring
things like Violetjewel and terrifying sword-arts such as the
nameless sword-art, World God Northrest naturally had left behind
many incredible techniques for Ning. Although some of the techniques
he gave Ning weren’t as good as the ones he himself used, they were
still techniques that not even most ordinary World Gods would not
have access to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protective divine
abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evasion divine
abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forbidden skills!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had passed down many
such abilities. Ning had long ago mastered the heartforce scrying
technique and the heartforce soul-lock technique, but he had also
mastered a protective divine ability. World God Northrest had
transmitted to Ji Ning a divine ability known as the [Golden Statue].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Statue]
divine ability was an ability which World God Northrest himself
trained in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t a technique
which he had acquired from Vastheaven Palace. Although he had learned
some techniques from Vastheaven Palace, while adventuring through the
endless primordial chaos he had undergone many trials before finally
acquiring the upper section and middle section of the [Golden Statue]
divine ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After acquiring this
divine ability, World God Northrest hadn’t hesitated at all; he had
immediately given up his previous protective divine ability to
completely focus on this one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Statue]
divine ability had an extraordinary history to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos there was an extremely large world, a world far
vaster than the entire Three Realms. It was a world that could last
forever, unlike the ephemeral chaosworlds. Ten, a hundred, a thousand
chaos cycles could go past, but this world would continue to remain.
At the center of this vast world there was an enormous levitating
island, and hovering directly above the island was a towering golden
statue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden statue was
54,000 meters tall, and it emanated an aura of boundless might and
majesty. This aura made it so that not even World Gods would be able
to step foot onto that levitating island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then one day, an
absolute genius who had viewed the golden statue for countless years
finally managed to gain insight into it and devised the [Golden
Statue] divine ability. This instantly became one of the most
top-notch divine abilities in existence! It was divided into three
sections; the upper section, the middle section, and the lower
section.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The upper section of
the [Golden Statue] was the introductory section. When one mastered
it, one’s body would become comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic
treasure. True Gods could train in this section.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle section of
the [Golden Statue] could be used to train one’s body to become
comparable to a top-grade Chaos treasure. Elder Gods could train in
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
only acquired the upper section and middle section to this divine
ability, but it was so profound and high-class that he had still
chosen to use it. It was also comparatively easy to train in and so
he quickly mastered these two sections, upgrading his body to become
comparable to a top-grade Chaos treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he wasn’t
able to acquire the lower section, it didn’t make much of a
difference; even if he did acquire it, actually mastering it would be
incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I had a
foundation via the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].” When Ning had begun to
train in this divine ability, he couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Statue]
divine ability didn’t require any special items; it only required
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine power, Immortal
energy, chaos energy, spirit-pills…all sorts of energy could be
converted and absorbed! This was what made this such a formidable,
high-class technique. Because Ning himself had already reached the
Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], when he trained in the
[Golden Statue] he was able to start by using up the pre-existing
energy in his body. Thus, it only took him twelve years before his
body became equivalent to a top-grade Protocosmic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Statue] was
a divine ability that had to be slowly cultivated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cycles of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] could be mastered right away, but this came
at the cost of enormous energy requirements as well as a heavy burden
being placed on the body. This was why it was completely impossible
to continue to devise a way to make the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
usable for True Gods. To upgrade the body of a True God in such a way
would result in such tremendous stress being placed on the body that
there was simply no way it could endure it. The only option was to
slowly work on the body, and that was exactly what the [Golden
Statue] did. Since Ning had a solid foundation thanks to the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], he only needed roughly ten or so years to
master the [Golden Statue], and it hadn’t even been necessary for
him to use any Great Firmament pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had, he probably
would’ve been able to complete the process in three years. However,
his Primaltwin was already using up an enormous amount of Great
Firmament pills due to training in the Heavengazer Tower. Ten years
wasn’t that long, and so Ning had been willing to take it slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that this war against the Primordial Ruinworld would end up forcing
me to reveal my [Golden Statue] ability.” Ning couldn’t help but
sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivation techniques,
protective divine abilities, heartforce scanning techniques…these
were all techniques Ning possessed which didn’t exist in the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth. It seems everyone in the Three realms completely
underestimated you.” The one-armed man said coldly, “You actually
managed to train a protective divine ability to such an incredibly
high level without anyone being the wiser.” He had no idea that
this particular divine ability was something which even World Gods
would go wild over. World God Northrest himself had trained in this
divine ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his voice echoed in
Ning’s ears, he waved his hand and sent a rope flying towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Ning
frowned. Those with powerful bodies would mainly be worried about
being bound or being contained inside an item! The one-armed man
could launch as many saber-blows as he liked without it affecting
Ning, and indeed it would even hasten the formation-tearing process.
This rope, however, was another issue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
released the rip with two of his hands. His other four hands
continued to strive to widen the rip, but the two now-freed hands now
gripped a pair of Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed,
spinning into black holes that drew the rope towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
one-armed man charged forward, continuing to manipulate the rope
while launching another blow with his saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely focused
on defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one-armed man
actually had his own techniques that were similar to the [Three
Heads, Six Arms] ability, but he chose to keep just one arm. His
saber, however, truly was powerful! By comparison, even Ning’s
swords were a level lower in raw power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, when Ning used
two swords to defend at the same time, he was actually still able to
defend against Saber’s rope and saber combination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, just hold
on for a while longer. I’ve almost solved the formation,” Fuxi
sent hurriedly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
titanic body continued to tear at the formation with four arms while
defending himself with two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that I
feel like this Darknorth fellow is even tougher to deal with than
Tathagata? He’s just a local bumpkin; he should at most be a True
God.” After battling for a short period of time, Saber began to
feel as though Ning was unreasonably tough. But of course, he had no
idea that Ning was actually a half-step Elder God! Ning also had a
sword-art that surpassed the heavenly Daos, and he had spent nearly
two thousand years training within the Heavengazer Tower. This made
it so that his sword-arts had become even more well-rounded than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Saber, why is the
formation still breaking apart?” Godfiend Witherspike sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Darknorth
has a formidable protective divine ability that is as good as
Tathagata’s! His sword-arts are incredible as well. I can’t stop
him!” Saber sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you seeing
things?!” Godfiend Witherspike grew frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I landed a
saber-blow on him, I was only able to leave behind a white mark,”
Saber replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
continued to launch a furious barrage of attacks against Tathagata,
but he felt tremendous frustration in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
going on in the Three Realms? I, an exalted Elder God, had to work
incredibly hard in order to toughen my body and make it equivalent to
a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure. But these natives…they
clearly are mere True Gods. For Tathagata to be able to accomplish
this is one thing, but Darknorth’s trained for less than a thousand
years. How it is that his body is this powerful as well?!” Godfiend
Witherspike felt incredibly unhappy right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protective divine
abilities were extremely rare and difficult to train in. This was why
World God Northrest had immediately discarded his previous technique
and instead trained solely in the [Golden Statue] once he acquired
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those with
protective divine abilities are always a pain to deal with. Bind him?
Tathagata’s palm-arts are too powerful as well. There’s no way
I’ll be able to succeed in doing so. My only option is to continue
exhausting his store of divine power.” Godfiend Witherspike felt
helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after exhausting
Tathagata would he be able to capture him!

Chapter 26 - Battling Godfiend Witherspike
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can this all be due
to Nuwa? Are these techniques that she left behind?” Godfiend
Witherspike muttered to himself, “This all came out of nowhere. Now
that another troublesome individual like Darknorth has appeared…it
seems that taking over the Three Realms and taking away its
Worldheart will be even harder than I thought.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thing which
Godfiend Witherspike desired the most was the Worldheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the Three
Realms was formed from the collision of the Pangu Chaosworld and the
Seamless Chaosworld. That meant that its Worldheart was most likely
the combined Worldhearts of those two chaosworlds. If so, would be
even more valuable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who bar my
path shall die.” A savage light flickered in Godfiend Witherspike’s
eyes as he suppressed all extraneous thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep holding on for
just a little while longer,” Fuxi sent hurriedly. “I’m about to
break the formation apart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
towering Ji Ning continued to tear at the formation with four arms
while defending against Saber with his other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Saber
frowned. Seeing that he couldn’t stop Ning, Saber suddenly turned
and walked away, disappearing from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually
retreated?” Ning couldn’t be bothered to over-analyze the matter.
He immediately used all six of his hands to tear at the great
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning suddenly sensed
the strength of the formation begin to dramatically weaken, then
vanish entirely. He had been pulling at the rip with all his power;
now, all of a sudden, he ripped it completely apart by accident.
BOOM! The surrounding area completely exploded, causing many spatial
cracks and tears that quickly healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation has
been breached!” Fuxi said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, go save Lord
Buddha,” Ning barked back. As the formation broke apart, the
surrounding area returned to its normal appearance. Ning could now
actually see the golden figure of Lord Buddha seated in the lotus
position off in the distance. A Fiendgod with a long tail, loose
hair, and an aura of incomparable savagery was furiously assaulting
the seated figure, with many of the alien Outsiders of the Primordial
Chaosworld helping him out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry.” Instantly,
Fuxi, Kuafu, Daoist Jade Cauldron, and the others all transformed
into streaks of light and flew forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s the
other Outsider overlord?” Ning immediately noticed the jade-tailed
alien Outsider. The man was completely bald and looked rather
handsome. He had completely suppressed Lord Buddha in power. In the
face of his assaults, Lord Buddha was only able to completely focus
on defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsiders!” Upon
seeing his old friend in such dire straits, Fuxi immediately let out
an angry roar. “Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
Waterflame Apocalypse Formation descended. The surrounding area for a
million kilometers became filled with Arcane Moonwater and Eternal
Kindlefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were dozens of
major powers from the Primordial Ruinworld. For a situation like
this, a large formation that could launch area attacks was the ideal
tool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” None of
the alien True Gods or Daofathers dared to continue with their
attacks against Tathagata. Instead, they focused completely on
protecting themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This elderfire…”
The three Waterians frowned as well as they hid themselves within the
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once this formation
appeared, the power of the Primordial Ruinworld arrayed against Lord
Buddha instantly lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black lightning
serpent flashed through the skies, launching an initial strike
against the alien Outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gripped a sword in
each of his six arms. Five were Darknorth swords while the sixth was
Violetjewel. Things were quite critical and Ning could tell that Lord
Buddha wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer; he could very
well perish any moment now. At a time like this, he had to fight with
full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ll stop
him.” The red-bearded elder let out a low growl, his red beard
instantly expanding dramatically in size as it struck out towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the six retainers
who followed Godfiend Witherspike, Saber was the most powerful. Next
in power was the red-bearded elder! As for the three Waterians, they
could just barely reach the Elder God level of power after joining
together in a formation, but they were only really skilled in
defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning struck
out with his six swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six dazzling streaks of
sword-light instantly sliced across the skies. The skies had been
completely covered by the endless strands of red beard, but all the
strands were instantly shattered apart. The red-bearded elder’s
face turned paled with shock, and he hurriedly retereated to hide
behind the formation that had been set up by those dozens of alien
True Gods. He sent mentally in panic, “Master, Sword Immortal
Darknorth is shockingly strong. I’m unable to stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After shattering the
old man’s red beard, Ning charged straight towards Lord Tathagata
in an attempt to rescue him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Saber, you go deal
with Fuxi. Leave Ji Ning to me.” Godfiend Witherspike knew that,
given how Saber and Ji Ning specialized in attacks and how tough Ji
Ning’s body was, it was unlikely that Saber would be able to
succeed in doing anything to Ji Ning. Fuxi wasn’t that offensively
powerful; it would actually be a bit tougher for him to face Saber.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Saber
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Godfiend
Witherspike flew towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light
suddenly curved towards Ning without any warning at all. Ning was
badly startled, but fortunately he had been using his heartforce to
constantly scan the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast! So this
Outsider overlord’s tail has actually surpassed the limits of the
Heavenly Daos!” Ning was truly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was able to attack with his tail at incredible speed. Ning
immediately chopped out with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Sparks appeared
as the sword clashed with the tail. Godfiend Witherspike’s body was
tremendously durable as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually managed
to block with ease?” Godfiend Witherspike frowned as he manifested
a total of six arms, continuing his attacks against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly began
to battle against each other in midair, six arms against six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the battle began,
Ning realized that although Godfiend Witherspike was very strong,
only his tail had surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos; his arms
had not!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning
unleashed Violetjewel. Prior to this, he had been hiding
Violetjewel’s full power, keeping it weak and in line with the
other five Darknorth swords. Now, however, Ning suddenly slammed
Violetjewel down as he used the ‘Heavenbreaker stance’ of th
[Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel crashed
down like the thunder, slamming down against Godfiend Witherspike’s
pale white arm. Godfiend Witherspike’s face instantly changed
dramatically as he was knocked backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” All the
major powers of the Primordial Ruinworld were shocked. It had seemed
as though the Godfiend had held the upper hand in his fight against
Sword Immortal Darknorth. How was it that he was suddenly sent flying
backwards?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were actually
hiding your true power?” Godfiend Witherspike let out a bellow,
then charged forward once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even when I use
Violetjewel, I don’t have much of an advantage over him.” Ning
also frowned as he charged forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two exchanged
lightning-fast attacks as they battled furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had the advantage
of Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Witherspike had the
advantage of being a true Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two actually
battled to a complete standstill! This sight caused both the powers
of the Nuwa Alliance and the powers of the Primordial Ruinworld to
feel shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alien Outsider
is actually this powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth is actually this powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance was
stunned at Witherspike’s power. The Primordial Ruinworld was
stunned at Ji Ning’s power! Even though Ji Ning was an
overlord-class figure, they had thought that since Ji Ning had
trained for less than a thousand years, he was still inexperienced.
Moments ago, Ji Ning had revealed a truly shockingly powerful
protective divine ability…and now, he had revealed that his attacks
were every bit as powerful as those of this Outsider overlord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half a chaos
cycle had gone past since the war that ended the Primordial Era.
There were some major powers who were hiding their improvements; it
was entirely possible, for example, that Daoist Three Purities’
‘Immortal Slaying Formation’ was even more powerful than Ji
Ning’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of speed, Ji
Ning had the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of defense, he
had the [Golden Statue] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of attack, he
stood at the very peak of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had no apparent
weaknesses at all. This made him even more dangerous, as he could
deal with all types of situations. Any major power, Godfiend
Witherspike included, would feel a headache coming when they had to
fight against Ji NIng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Inexperienced?
Inexperience my ass! Those Seamless Gate idiots! They kept on toying
and toying and toying with him…and now, those imbeciles have ended
up creating a freak of an enemy.” Godfiend Witherspike ground his
teeth. “There’s no point to fighting against him like this. He’s
too powerful; there’s no way I can kill him. I should focus on
killing Tathagata instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Sword Immortal
Darknorth…I paid quite the price to acquire this formation. I
wouldn’t be willing to use it against just anybody,” Godfiend
Witherspike mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the same instant
that the two exchanged blows yet again, Godfiend Witherspike suddenly
waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six utterly enormous
stone pillars suddenly appeared out of nowhere, descending from the
heavens to cover an area of tens of thousands of kilometers. The
stone pillars instantly began to radiate with blurry light,
completely sealing off the outside world and causing space itself to
turn blurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!” Fuxi
and the others were shocked as they saw this enormous blurry
formation descend and trap Darknorth within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi, correct?”
Godfiend Witherspike turned his head to smile coldly at Fuxi. “I
heard that your skill in formations is the best amongst the locals.
Go ahead and try to break this one if you can, ahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi’s heart had
turned cold as he soon as he saw those six stone pillars. The stone
pillars were covered with extremely arcane runes. These runes
contained incredibly profound mysteries of space within them, and
Fuxi’s head turned dizzy as soon as he looked at them. He instantly
understood that this was definitely a formation that vastly, vastly
outstripped any formation he had ever made. There was no way he would
ever be able to possibly break it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His guess was correct.
This was a formation that had been created by a Chaos Immortal who
was skilled in the art of formations. It was one of the trump cards
which Godfiend Witherspike used when he adventured in the primordial
chaos to trap tough foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to
survive adventuring through the primordial chaos, you needed to have
some trump cards up your sleeve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterians under his
command were another set of trump cards; when he encountered great
danger, he would force those three servants of his to go block for
him. However, they were only one of his ‘ordinary’ trump cards.
This formation was one of his most important ones. Once unleashed,
any foe trapped within would need to spend a long period of time
before being able to overcome it. By then, he would’ve fled long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I might not be able to
kill you, but I can trap you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
had paid quite a heavy price to acquire this item. If it wasn’t for
the fact that Ji Ning was incredibly powerful, he wouldn’t have
been willing to use this treasure at all. If a foe spent enough time
figuring out how the formation worked, he would be able to break
through it and render it completely useless in the future. This sort
of formation was generally a single-use item; Witherspike certainly
didn’t have the ability to remake it or repair it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, I’ll kill
Tathagata. Then, if I have enough time, I’ll kill Fuxi as well,”
Godfiend Witherspike mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had started to
battle against Godfiend Witherspike again. Just as he had been
knocked backwards a few steps, he saw six stone pillars descend out
of nowhere. Immediately afterwards, the area around him turned
blurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither heartforce nor
coresense could see past the haze, and he was only able to physically
see to a distance of three hundred meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formation?” Ning
stared at the blurry area around him. “I’ve been trapped in a
formation?”
</P>

Chapter 27 - Fighting Back
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning brandished
Violetjewel, causing it to explosively increase in size to become
many tens of thousands of meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Faced with
this blurry region, Ning let out a roar as he raised the enormous
sword high into the air, then chopped downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He struck out with the
‘Heavenbreaker stance’. In terms of intent and will, it wasn’t
too far from the will which Pangu had possessed when he had cleaved
Heaven from Earth and established the world. Pangu had been born with
mastery over the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos, but his
establishment of the world was part of his innate purpose for
existing; he was the weakest type of World God possible. For those
who had actually trained to become a World God, the establishment of
a chaosworld would not result in their deaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword struck out,
causing thunder to boom out around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
“Although there were some vibrations, the formation is still quite
stable. In fact, it is far more stable than the formation we dealt
with earlier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would not be
possible for him to break through this formation with raw force. What
should he do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning began to
move, quickly flying forward through the formation. The situation
outside was most assuredly quite grim, and Lord Tathagata was in
grave danger, but Ning put away all his other considerations as he
completely focused on how to break through this formation as soon as
he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for just a
second, Ning came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no danger
here whatsoever…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I flew a few hundred
thousand kilometers in that second, but I encountered no danger
whatsoever, nor where there any illusions. All I see is this
perpetual blur and haze.” Ning was stunned. “Can it be…is this
an ‘Endless Road’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those six stone
pillars…right. Damn! This is an ‘Endless Road’ formation!”
Ning’s face instantly turned unsightly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
transmitted much information to Ning, including a great deal of
knowledge regarding common yet troublesome formations. One such
formation was known as the ‘Endless Road’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos, there were worlds that were far larger than the
Three Realms which held many major powers. All of them needed to
train, and so it was quite common for them to exchange techniques and
items with each other! One particularly powerful type of formation
which many Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were quite willing to
purchase was this, the ‘Endless Road’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The principles behind
the ‘Endless Road’ were quite simple. It made use of the
principles of the Dao of Space to transform a region that was
originally just ten thousand kilometers in size to become a hundred
million kilometers in size! The target would be trapped at the very
center of the formation. If you wanted to escape it, the only option
you had would be to physically fly out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to
teleport from within the formation. Thus, you had to spend a
considerable amount of time flying from the center of the formation
to the outside. That period of time would be more than enough for the
formation-user to either flee or do something else! This made this
particular formation a very popular item in the endless primordial
chaos, and each time someone offered one for sale it would be
immediately snapped up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, it was also
theoretically possible to break the formation through raw force! The
problem was that although the formation was seemingly simple, the
arcane mysteries of the Dao of Space inside it were unfathomably
profound. Even World Gods or Chaos Immortals would need a bit of time
to break the formation. As for Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals?
There was no chance of it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I can do is keep
flying!” Although Ning felt incredibly frantic, there was nothing
else he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning transformed
into a black lightning serpent, chose a direction, then immediately
began to flee at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Save Tathagata!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation,
the battle had reached a crescendo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was leading Kuafu
and Jade Cauldron’s squads in a furious assault against the
one-armed man, ‘Saber’. Saber had transformed to become thirty
thousand meters tall, and he sent his saber flashing out in streaks
of cold, savage light, preventing Fuxi and the others from moving
past him. Fuxi was still just a True God, after all; although he had
extremely profound insights into the Dao, he had primarily focused on
the art of formations. While using formations he was able to just
barely be a match for Saber, but he was still at a significant
disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only someone like Ji
Ning, a half-step Elder God who had a powerful divine body and a
sword like Violetjewel, could truly cause Saber trouble. Even
Godfiend Witherspike had been unable to do anything to Ning and had
been forced to use his precious Endless Roads formation to trap Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu, Jade Cauldron,
and the others had all joined together into formations and were
launching attacks from far away, but Saber was able to easily block
the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
golden-armored retainers of Godfiend Witherspike, they were in
command of the True Gods and Daofathers of the Primordial Chaosworld,
having organized them into formations to resist the Waterflame
Apocalypse Formation. Every so often, they’d launch a few attacks
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, Fuxi’s
entire squad had been completely blocked off by Saber and the enemy
major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one-armed
Outsider is far too powerful.” Fuxi gritted his teeth. Per the
plans of the Nuwa Alliance, Fuxi’s role was generally to focus on
using formations to control and influence the overall battlefield,
not fight against powerful ones in one-on-one combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata, you have
to hold.” Fuxi willed it, and instantly the Arcane Moonwater and
Eternal Kindlefire close to Godfiend Witherspike transformed into a
pair of enormous dragons, one of water and one of fire. The two
dragons furiously coiled around the mighty Godfiend!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the ‘true’
way to use the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation. Because Fuxi had to
spend much of his attention on dealing with Saber, he was only able
to activate the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation within that fairly
small region. Clearly, he was planning to use it to tie down Godfiend
Witherspike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! The
dragons of fire and water coiled around Godfiend Witherspike, but his
body was so durable that he was able to completely ignore them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A technique that
joins elderfire and elderwater together? This technique is so
profound that it can actually slow down my movements.” Godfiend
Witherspike quickly realized how tough this formation was to deal
with, but he still let out a sneer. “A pity for them that Tathagata
is almost done for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was being
constricted by the dragons of water and fire, he continued to
furiously rain down attacks against Lord Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the formation had
been broken apart, Lord Buddha had risen to his feet, intending to
flee. But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
moved even more quickly than he did. No matter how he tried,
Tathagata was unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine power is
almost exhausted.” Lord Buddha let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A kind-looking Buddha
dressed in a kasaya frock suddenly emerged from Lord Tathagata’s
body. Light blazed around his body as he struck out with full power,
assaulting Godfiend Witherspike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, is this your
final attempt to fight back? You are going to sacrifice your
dharma-bodies now?” Godfiend Witherspike laughed wildly. Boom!
Boom! Boom! After three brief clashes, the blazing figure completely
broke apart and vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was his
Medicine Buddha body.” The distant Fuxi felt pain in his heart upon
seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sakyamuni body was
Lord Buddha’s true body, and he had four mighty dharma-bodies as
well. This time, Lord Buddha had brought his Sakyamuni body along
with two of his dharma-bodies, but over the course of this battle
they had exhausted all of their energy. Lord Buddha’s only choice
was to try and preserve his Sakyamuni body while sending out his
dharma-bodies to die in the hopes of buying some more time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These dharma-bodies had
all been painstakingly cultivated…and today, in a single day, they
would be destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the true body
was what mattered the most. So long as the true body remained alive,
the dharma-bodies could slowly be remade once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Lord Buddha
continued to flee as he sent yet another dharma-body flying out from
inside of him. This dharma-body blazed with blinding fire, as though
it was the sun itself. This was the Great Sun Buddha body, and its
attacks were even more powerful than the attacks of the Medicine
Buddha body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of technique
and power, it was still a bit weaker than the true body. If even the
true body was unable to withstand Witherspike’s attacks, how could
the Great Sun Buddha possibly do so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still struggling?”
Godfiend Witherspike felt quite irritated. He continued his furious
assaults, and a few short clashes later the Great Sun Buddha body
also dissipated into specks of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Godfiend
Witherspike continued to chase after Lord Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to join
together with Fuxi?” Godfiend Witherspike’s tail suddenly lashed
out. Whoosh! It struck out faster than the speed of light towards
Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha immediately moved to block. Boom! Lord
Buddha was sent staggering backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha’s eyes
were dim but peaceful. He folded his hands together in prayer,
looking calmly at the approaching Godfiend Witherspike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“TATHAGATA!” Fuxi
cried out in agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing you really
wasn’t easy.” Godfiend Witherspike finally relaxed slightly.
‘Lord Buddha’ apparently no longer had any divine power left. He
had long ago converted all of flesh and blood inside of him into
divine power, leaving behind only the outside layer of his golden
body. His golden body technique was quite special; he became
incredibly powerful after mastering it, but there was no way to
reconvert his golden body into divine power. After he died, he would
only leave his golden body behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
Bodhisattvas and Buddhas who would leave behind golden bodies after
dying. But of course, Tathagata had trained his golden body technique
to the highest possible level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I have become the
first to fall before the great tribulation.” Lord Buddha looked at
Godfiend Witherspike calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he’s
preparing to give me one final blow before he dies?” Godfiend
Witherspike didn’t dare to be over-confident. Killing Tathagata was
no easy feat, and he had paid quite a heavy price to accomplish it.
He had lost all four of his Thearchs, and he had even been forced to
take out his ‘Endless Roads’ formation to trap Sword Immortal
Darknorth. He certainly didn’t want to mess up at the very end!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An sudden explosion
could be heard. Off in the distance, the six stone pillars
surrounding the blurry formation were suddenly revealed, along with
another figure…that of the sword-wielding Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth?” Godfiend Witherspike’s face immediately changed, but
his expressions then turned savage as he charged unhesitatingly
towards Tathagata. “DIE!” His sharp claws struck directly towards
Tathagata, giving the distant Ji Ning no time to intervene at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Lord Buddha saw Ji
Ning emerge, a smile appeared on his formerly calm face. He let out a
low growl, then struck out with both his palms. Boom! His giant hands
struck out towards Godfiend Witherspike like a pair of massive
worlds.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two palms were
like worlds unto themselves, and they angered Godfiend Witherfiend so
much that he ground his teeth. “So he really was preparing to
deliver one final blow to me before dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha was a True God. Although he was able to unleash the power of
an Elder God, in terms of raw power he was indeed a bit inferior to
Godfiend Witherspike. However, the intricacies of his palm-arts far
surpassed Witherspike’s techniques. There was no way Godfiend
Witherspike could avoid this final desperation attack; his only
choice was to face it head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two attacks
collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata borrowed
from the force of the collision to fly backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsider!” Ji Ning
let out a loud roar, transforming into a black lightning serpent as
he charged towards Godfiend Witherspike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” After
exchanging blows with Tathagata, Godfiend Witherspike was sent
staggering backwards as well. By the time he recovered, Ji Ning was
already attacking. Godfiend Witherspike could only cast a hateful,
resentful glance towards Lord Tathagata as the latter flew far away.
“I spent all that effort and paid such a heavy price, but I
actually wasn’t able to kill even one of these ‘overlord’ level
bumpkins. I really don’t want to accept this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
descended!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dazzling to
behold, and it seemed to contain enough power to split the skies
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap! Godfiend
Witherspike’s tail lashed out, transforming into a similarly
dazzling streak of light that collided against the sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was knocked flying backwards. He gave Ning a cold look, watching as
Ning transformed into a black streak of lightning that flew next to
Lord Tathagata. With a wave of his hand, he pulled Lord Tathagata
into his own estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” The
distant one-armed man sent a mental message to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave!”
Godfiend Witherspike said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This word, ‘leave’,
came from his lips with the utmost of reluctance. Godfiend
Witherspike waved his hand, causing those six stone pillars to
disappear. Although the ‘Endless Road’ had been somewhat damaged
by Ning’s escape, a skilled formations expert would still be able
to repair it. The price of repairing it would be much lower than the
price of buying a new one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave.” The
one-armed man waved his hand, collecting the alien True Gods as well
as the three Waterians, the red-bearded elder, and the skinny elder.
He then immediately flew over to Godfiend Witherspike’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Count yourself
lucky.” Godfiend Witherspike smiled coldly towards Ning and the
others. “The Primordial Ruinworld is a large place. We’ll take
things slowly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and the one-armed man disappeared, a dark-golden castle appearing
where they were. The dark-golden castle immediately flew away and
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was once more seated on his throne. Below him were his six retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Sword
Immortal Darknorth was trapped inside the the Endless Road formation.
How did he end up emerging from it so quickly?” The red-bearded
elder couldn’t help but ask this question. “It was too fast. He
was only trapped inside for a brief period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was quite brief.”
The one-armed man frowned as well. “These locals…they are fairly
ignorant and ill-informed. They shouldn’t have been able to
recognize the formation as an Endless Road formation. Someone who has
never seen this formation…upon being trapped inside it, he
should’ve spent a long period of time trying to figure out what to
do. The formation is so vast that flying out would take a good long
while.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Godfiend
Witherspike’s eyes flashed with cold light as he nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were right.
Someone trapped in a formation he had never seen before would
generally spend some time carefully testing it out. It would usually
take them quite some time before emerging from the Endless Road
formation. Ji Ning, however, had come out a short period of time
after being trapped inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s only one
explanation. As soon as he was trapped inside the formation, he
immediately knew what it was and how to escape.” Godfiend
Witherspike said coldly, “He immediately used his [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique to fly out of it at top speed. That
sounds about right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he
possibly have immediately recognized the formation?” The one-armed
man frowned. “Can it be that he’s seen it before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
have encountered figures like ‘All Things’ before,” Godfiend
Witherspike said. “Sword Immortal Darknorth must have acquired some
records pertaining to the ‘Endless Road’ formation from some
alien Outsider who wandered into this place. Hmph. He can count
himself lucky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, if you truly
wished to kill Tathagata…I feel that you could have accomplished
it.” The one-armed man looked towards Godfiend Witherspike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power amongst Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. Ordinary Elder
Gods, those who were born at that level of power, were close in
strength to Three Purities, Fuxi, Tathagata, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Things
and Godfiend Witherspike could be described as elite Elder Gods. The
Lord of All Things reached that level of power thanks to his mastery
over golems and bugbeasts, while Godfiend Witherspike rose to power
thanks to extremely bloody and violent techniques. This was why he
was known as a ‘Godfiend’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
Primordial Chaos, people titled ‘Godfiend’ were generally people
who possessed and used exceptionally bloody and terrifying
techniques. But even if he didn’t use those secret techniques,
Godfiend Witherspike would still be considered an elite Elder God,
albeit just barely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason why Ji
Ning was able to battle Witherspike to a standstill was because he
had terrifying sword-arts and a half-step Elder God body, which
allowed him to reach the power level of an ordinary Elder God. With
the addition of Violetjewel, he could also be considered to have just
barely reached the level of an elite Elder God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Godfiend
Witherspike slowly shook his head. “Ever since I mastered that
secret art, I’ve only used it a total of three times. Each time I
use it…I will suffer severe repercussions, and it’ll be another
ten thousand years before I can use it again. The Endwar will be
arriving soon, in a few more centuries at most. We can’t be hasty!
We’ve killed two of Tathagata’s dharma-bodies, and I’ve
sacrificed both the Four Thearchs as well as my Endless Road
formation. We’ve done enough. The rest is up to the Seamless Gate.
Their ‘Lord of All Fiends’ is extraordinarily powerful; the only
person in the Three Realms who worries me is him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
one-armed man nodded. “For an Elder God to be able to escape from
the clutches of a World God and flee so quickly that the World God
can’t even catch up…this is unheard of. I’ve voyaged through
the endless primordial chaos for quite a long period of time and have
met over ten thousand Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals, but I’ve
never met such a formidable figure. Such figures only exist in
legends. I never would’ve thought that an Elder God located in such
a backwater chaosworld would be so powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…but we’ve
only just begun to play,” Godfiend Witherspike said softly. “These
two alliances haven’t really begun the final fight to the death
yet. We would be a laughingstock if we revealed all of our cards
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Darknorth
fellow…” Godfiend Witherspike suddenly frowned. “He has six
swords. When he strikes with the blood-colored one, he is actually
able to just barely reach the level of an elite Elder God in power.
Is it due to the sword? Or is it because he is already an Elder God?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was standing
alongside Fuxi. Behind him was Kuafu, Daoist Jade Cauldron, and the
other members of their group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They watched as the
dark-golden castle quickly disappeared into the distance. Only then
did Ning let Tathagata emerge once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
group of alien Outsiders,” Fuxi murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, Ji Ning
was with us.” Tathagata smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi looked at
Tathagata, then let out a sigh. “It’s all my fault. I was too
weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, those alien
Outsiders were simply too strong.” Tathagata shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi couldn’t help
but nod. He said solemnly, “Yes. They were too powerful, especially
that one with a tail. Those two alien Outsiders…they should have
the power of elite Elder Gods. Fortunately, Ji Ning was able to stop
him.” Fuxi then turned to look towards Ning, his eyes filled with
surprise. “Darknorth, you were actually able to stop them…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They still had the
upper hand when we fought,” Ning said. “I was only able to fight
on par thanks to this sword.” When he had used the blood-colored
Violetjewel, his blows had become noticeably more powerful. The alien
Outsider had seen it, as had Fuxi and the others. They probably had
already guessed the truth for themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw
power…no one in the Three Realms, those two alien Outsiders
included, would dare claim that they were certain of defeating Ji
Ning in a fight! Given how strong he was, there really was nothing
for Ji Ning to fear any longer. Still, he couldn’t tell everyone
that he had only unlocked a fraction of Violetjewel’s true power.
Fully repairing Violetjewel…that would be a task for the distant
future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder. It seems
that you’ve had quite a few fortuitous encounters, Ji Ning.” Fuxi
smiled and nodded. “Ji Ning, you might not fully understand what an
‘elite Elder God’ is! Myself, Nuwa, Zhurong, the Ancestor
Dragon…we were all born as Elder Gods, which means we were born at
that level of power. Three Purities, Tathagata, Shennong…they are
True Gods and Daofathers, but thanks to their tremendously profound
insights into the Dao they too are comparable to ordinary Elder Gods.
In the Three Realms, we describe this level of power as that of the
‘overlords’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Elder God who has
sufficient insights into the Dao, such as having mastered the Five
Elements of the Heavenly Daos, will be described as an ‘elite Elder
God’. Mother Nuwa, for example; even before the war that ended the
Primordial Era, she had mastered the Heavenly Daos of Metal, Wood,
Water, Fire, Earth, Yin, Yang, and Life. Eight Heavenly Daos! She was
so powerful that she was even superior to so-called ‘elite Elder
Gods’. She was far more powerful than the two alien Outsiders we
encountered today. Only Demonheart, the lord of the Seamless
Chaosworld, was comparable to her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Nuwa truly
was a monster. She was an Elder God who had mastered eight of the
Heavenly Daos…and then, in the final battle, she had broken through
to master the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos and become a World
God!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, Nuwa
left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonheart merged
into the Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi shook his head. “I
was born an Elder God with power over the Heavenly Dao of
Destruction. I sent myself into reincarnation, never to regain my
former memories or powers until I master the Heavenly Dao of Life.”
Fuxi sighed, then said self-deprecatingly, “I’ve now mastered two
additional Heavenly Daos, the Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang, but I’ve
been unable to master the Heavenly Dao of Life. That’s why I remain
merely a True God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In all the Three
Realms, the only known Elder God still around is the Seamless Gate’s
‘Lord of All Fiends’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, Darknorth, you
have acquired a protective divine ability that is on par with
Tathagata’s.” Fuxi looked at Ji Ning. “Your sword-arts are so
formidable that you were able to fight that alien Outsider to a
standstill. Given your power, I imagine that there is no longer
anyone in all the Three Realms who you would need to fear. For us to
gain a new, powerful ally like you at such a critical moment in
history is truly a blessing for our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata smiled as
well as he looked at Ji Ning. Although he had lost two of his
dharma-bodies, he still felt joy upon seeing how powerful Ji Ning
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group was in no
hurry to continue the campaign. They just continued to wait without
moving. After enough time passed for a kettle of tea to be boiled,
Houyi and Suiren’s group of True Gods and Daofathers arrived as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There weren’t too
many major powers left to protect the Nuwa Alliance in the Three
Realms, and so a short while later Lord Buddha and Suiren departed,
taking those True Gods and Daofathers back with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Human Sovereign Fuxi, and Houyi commanded a total of
twenty-nine True Gods and Daofathers as they continued their campaign
through the Primordial Ruinworld! Every remaining part of the
Primordial Ruinworld was located in extremely dangerous regions.
After their latest experience, Ning and the others advanced with even
greater caution and moved even slower than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, they were
divided into just three squads. The three squads were led by Ji Ning,
Fuxi, and Houyi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their three squads
maintained a distance of three million kilometers from each other.
They advanced in lockstep and they kept in continuous contact with
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they
hadn’t been willing to join together into a single group was
precisely because they were worried about everyone ending up trapped
within a single formation. Last time, if Fuxi and Ji Ning had both
been trapped inside the formation with Tathagata, it would’ve been
much harder for Fuxi to break apart the formation. Ji Ning wouldn’t
have been able to assist him by tearing at the formation from
outside! Thus, although separating into three squads created new
risk, at least it would ensure that they wouldn’t all be caught in
one trap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three million
kilometers was a fairly short distance. Given Ning’s speed with the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent], he’d be able to travel that distance
in a single breath. All the squads would be able to quickly reinforce
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day at
a time. The three squads continued to destroy every single world and
region they travelled through!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and the Seamless Gate continued to set down traps and formations to
deal with them, but the extremely cautious experts of the Nuwa
Alliance would never encounter such a terrifyingly dangerous
situation again. They slowly and laboriously dealt with every single
danger as they destroyed one world after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Destroying the
Primordial Ruinworld represented destroying the territory and
homeland of the alien Outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar is about
to sweep through the Three Realms. If these Outsiders are permitted
to survive, they would most likely come and invade the Three Realms.”
None of them showed any mercy. For the sake of the survival of their
races, no mercy could be shown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
did have some estate-treasures which allowed him to hold some living
creatures, but how many could it possibly hold? It could hold less
than 0.01% of the creatures who lived in the Primordial Ruinworld.
All the others would die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning, Houyi, and
Fuxi continued to work together and support each other, they grew
much closer to each other as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-nine years had
passed since the launching of the campaign against the Primordial
Ruinworld. Nineteen years had passed since Tathagata had fallen into
danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Primordial
Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hatchet-carrying
woodcutter, a sword-wielding white-robed youth, and a tall man
dressed in Daoist robes stood together in the Void, a large group of
major powers behind them. Everyone was staring at the Primordial
Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could see a
massive realm teetering at the brink of collapse. The breaking
process slowly hastened…and then, all of a sudden, the badly
damaged Primordial Ruinworld began to completely break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a thunderous boom,
countless shattered spatial shards appeared in that area. The entire
Primordial Ruinworld was completely imploding, and as it did the
increasingly powerful spatial shards began to destroy everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elsewhere in the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dark-golden castle
was hanging here in midair, the space around it rippling with
formation runes. However, there was no way to locate this ship with
the naked eye, and even coresense was completely blocked off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a view.”
Godfiend Witherspike’s gaze passed through the walls of the castle,
seeing through the endless void of space as he stared at the distant
Primordial Ruinworld. The Primordial Ruinworld looked like an
enormous fireworks display as countless spatial shards were sent
flying in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms.”
The alien True Gods standing before him gnashed their teeth in rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their home
that had just been destroyed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been the
followers of the Lord of All Things, but he was defeated in battle.
Mother Nuwa hadn’t wiped them out; instead, she had driven them
into the Primordial Ruinworld, a place where survival itself was
incredibly difficult. It was hard for them to truly flourish in the
Primordial Ruinworld, and they had always dreamed of one day
counter-attacking and taking over the Three Realms. They would then
live in luxury and ease in that beautiful, safe world. They would no
longer suffer from random spatial distortions, temporal storms, and
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They rather hated how
deadly and inhospitable the Primordial Ruinworld was…but it was
still their home!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, even their final
refuge had been torn asunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alien True Gods all
had estate-treasures with them, and they were able to bring some of
their kinsmen with them inside. However, the total amount of kinsmen
they could carry was just a tiny fraction of the total population of
the Primordial Ruinworld. Those who were left behind all perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms.
Fuxi. Houyi. Tathagata.” The alien True Gods firmly engraved these
hated names into their memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
neither knew nor cared about their hatred. In fact, if they had the
chance they would probably move to completely wipe out all of the
alien True Gods. These alien Outsiders were invaders who had always
been the enemies of the Three Realms. The more of them the Nuwa
Alliance was able to kill, the better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
red-bearded elder suddenly said, “What should we do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next?” Godfiend
Witherspike said softly, “We’ve sacrificed enough already, and
even our territory has been completely destroyed. Fuxi, Darknorth,
and Houyi are simply too powerful when they join forces. There’s
nothing I can do. The Seamless Gate cannot blame me. It’ll be up to
them now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get some rest,
everyone. We will keep waiting. Soon…the Endwar will come soon…”
Godfiend Witherspike let out a chuckle. “That’s our true
battlefield. Ahaha…it’s been a long time since I’ve truly
engaged in such an exciting battle. The last time was back when we
were in that mountain gorge. These natives…they don’t have any
formidable formations or treasures at all. The only thing they can do
in war is to stake their lives. When the Endwar comes, they shall all
become delicacies for me to eat…” He licked the corner of his
lips with his long tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar…” The
one-armed man nodded slowly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had roamed the
primordial chaos together, and they had staked their own lives
multiple times when doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was going to acquire the Worldheart of the Three Realms, no matter
what the risk or the cost. After Saber finished repaying his debt to
the man, he would depart and continue forward on his own path of
cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five
retainers were true slaves. He had only become a retainer in order to
repay a debt. He could be considered a servant, but he was no slave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld was simply far too vast. Its collapse and annihilation took
three full months to complete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi, Ji Ning, Fuxi,
and the True Gods and Daofathers who followed them simply watched for
three full months. After everything came to a halt Fuxi gave the
remnants a final look, then nodded. “All of the worlds of the
Primordial Ruinworld have been destroyed. The only thing left in the
Primordial Ruinworld are those unique danger zones such as ‘Earthmoan
Mountain’ or the ‘Endless Sea’. Those places are too stable;
even the destruction of the Primordial Ruinworld wouldn’t damage
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw roughly ten or
so places as well when he scanned the ruins. All of them were
extremely stable and dangerous locations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial
Ruinworld is finished. Those alien Outsiders are now like a well that
has run dry,” Houyi said calmly. “They will be unable to
propagate and flourish. If they appear during the Endwar, we’ll
deal with them then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Fuxi
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
actually been quite worried about the Primordial Ruinworld. If the
Seamless Gate was defeated but its survivors chose to hide within the
inhospitable environment of the Primordial Ruinworld, they would
always be hungrily eyeing the Three Realms from there. If that
happened…the Three Realms would never know a day of peace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now they had destroyed
the Primordial Ruinworld. The Lord of All Fiends was formidable and
he might be able to flee with the survivors of the Seamless Gate, but
if they didn’t have a place to live then as a race they would never
be able to grow powerful again. They would slowly wither away while
the Nuwa Alliance would continue to flourish in the Three Realms,
producing more and more experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Fuxi
suddenly sent a mental message to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Everyone around them was on their side; why did Fuxi elect to send a
private mental message?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You now stand at the
highest level of power in the Three Realms. In fact, you can be
considered one of the most powerful individuals on either side. The
Nuwa Alliance has many secrets which you do not know about…but now,
it is time to tell you. Perhaps you’ll be able to grow a bit more
powerful.” Fuxi looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The secrets of the
Nuwa Alliance?” Ning felt his heartrate quicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us return to the
Allclans Palace first. Just follow me later,” Fuxi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi had originally
been an Elder God. He was extremely close to Nuwa, and he naturally
knew all of the secrets of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Ning
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi smiled. “Everyone.
Our campaign against the Primordial Ruinworld has lasted for
thirty-nine years, but we have finally finished destroying the
enemy’s lair! Now, we can set our minds at ease as we turn towards
our true foes. We’ve never feared fighting any in a straight-up
battle! Come. Let us return to the Allclans Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Return to the
Allclans Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers
immediately tore a hole through the Void and traversed it back to the
Allclans Palace of the Three Realms.
